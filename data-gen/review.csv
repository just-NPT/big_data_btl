Apparel,5.0,Enjoyed the product,It is an exact replica of from the one Naruto carries. It is well built and sturdy. I have it stuffed to the top with coins and it shows no signs of breaking. I recommend it!
Apparel,5.0,Cute little coin purse!,"This coin purse is really cute, and looks EXACTLY like the one that is featured in the Naruto series. It's built well and can hold many coins. My ONLY gripe with it is that it's kind of small - the one in the anime is a bit bigger, so I thought the one I was buying would be too. But, I suppose it's 'standard coin purse size', so I don't mind that much. Overall, I love mine and use it all the time!<br />:)"
Apparel,1.0,RIP OFF!,"Total Mis-representation of the Product! Product pictured is premium quality with chain and googley eyes - product received was cheapy felt knock off! I ordered 3 of these for Christmas presents. They took forever to ship and when I received them I was sooo bummed at the poor quality and embarrassed to give them as gifts. This vendor was not the only one to mis-represent this same product! Shame on you, Amazon."
Apparel,4.0,It is very similar to Naruto's coin purse!!!,I am happy with this item because it is very simmilar to Naruto's.<br />The materials are strong and nice details!!!
Apparel,5.0,Great!,It came in the mail quickly and efficiently. Beautiful condtion. Thank you so much for the business.
Apparel,3.0,Tough to get a razors edge,"The sharpening system is a good one, but it is tough to get that razors edge I was trying to achieve.  I have very high quality knives and I was looking for a sharpening kit to have the same quality.  It takes some getting used to however, knowing what I know now I would have spent a little more and purchased a higher quality system."
Apparel,3.0,This is not a toy!,"I have no idea why this watch is being categorized as a toy.  However,it is pretty enough, and performs its function of keeping time very well.  A bit gaudy, but you can easily dress an outfit up or down with this accessory."
Apparel,5.0,Fan Favorite,this is the 2nd one of these that we have ordered for friends birthdays.  Product is accurate to show.
Apparel,3.0,Not happy...,"So I was told I needed a naruto frog coin purse with googlely eyes for my younger cousins birthday. So I of course came to Amazon and searched it. This was the first one that came up and when I looked at it, it was perfect. So I ordered it and it shipped fast at least, but when I opened the bag it came in, the frog looked almost NOTHING like the picture that is posted for it. I would return it and get another one from a different seller if I didn't need it in 3 days for the birthday party."
Apparel,4.0,Pretty watch,"This is my first Swatch watch, and I like it a lot!  The design is very pretty.  The face of the watch looks beautiful, with the numbers 12, 3, 6, and 9 named, and with the other hours as little blue and pink gems.  The band consisting of smaller links and links that look like a leaf with gems, and pretty circles (see picture above).  I was worried about the links falling off because they are a little thin, but I've had this watch for a few months now, and no problems there.  Just make sure that if you do get wrist adjustments done at a Swatch store (or another watch store), that they secure the little rods holding the links, otherwise the links will fall apart.    My only complaints are that the face is susceptible to scratches if you aren't careful (it's plastic), and the ticking of the watch can be a bit loud in a silent room.    Other than those minor complaints, this is a good women's watch.  I've gotten compliments about my watch from a lot of my girl friends!"
Apparel,4.0,Discrete and modern,"This watch is modern, small and the crystal accessories makes it a good choice, and has a good price.<br /><br />For the price this watch is a good choice, Nothing exuberant, simple, modern, and looks good."
Apparel,5.0,KEENly Addictive...,Love wearing this everyday which I bought a year ago. Can't wait for it to wear out that I bought another Newport H2!
Apparel,5.0,My girflriend loved it.,"I bought the watch as a christmas present for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it, the watch itself is really beautifull and it looks great when worn."
Apparel,5.0,Beautiful Watch,Looooove this watch. It looks great on. You can dress it up or down and always looks beautiful. My favorite watch.
Apparel,4.0,Beautiful watch,"It's a beautiful watch, has a delicate design and very feminine; eventhough it is a little bit shiny for daily use. In my opinion it looks better on picture than personally."
Apparel,5.0,love it,excelent product will purchase it again. it was a gift and the person love it as well as me.  the weight and the size are excelent
Apparel,5.0,Great watch,This is a Christmas gift for my 12 years old daughter. The watch came in on time. My daughter absolutely loves it in spite of the fact that she couldn't wear it until after New Year since we had to go to a local Jewelry store to re-size the band. It is prettier than it appears on the posted pictures.
Apparel,5.0,Beautiful Watch,"This watch is classy and elegant, while still being casual enough to wear with any outfit.  The subtle flower motif (which is hard to see in the image)is really lovely, feminine and fun."
Apparel,3.0,the build quality is a bit disapointing,"The watch is okay, but the crystal stuff on the band was easily been detached. A bit disapponited with the swatch quality."
Apparel,3.0,beautiful but hard to use,"This watch is beautiful, but its jewelry clasp is very hard to open.<br />I have even considered seriously to return it because I can't open the clasp.<br />But anyway, I keep it for its good look."
Apparel,3.0,Not what I ordered,"The key chain I ordered was not received. I have contacted this company but they have not responded to my inquiry. I ordered a round \\""spinner\\"" key chain and what I received was a one-sided square key chain."
Apparel,5.0,Excelente reloj.,"Es un excelente reloj con un costo bastante bueno, recibi el producto de forma rapida y en perfecto estado. Muy buen proveedor !!"
Apparel,5.0,My wife loves this,I gave this to my wife on her birthday and she loved it. It's funny how the frog looks when it's full. It has a happy face because you have a lot of change. Awesome!
Apparel,2.0,nice,everything is fine the same as the picture.<br />It is a very cool watch and very nice.<br />with all its papers.
Apparel,4.0,bueno,muy bueno lo recomiendo es excelente servicio de compra venta hasta miami. Es un buen producto y satisiface mis necesidades
Apparel,5.0,Ram in mounts the best.,"This accesory is exelent funcional with a great quality. The seller very recomendable, honest. The shipping was very fast. The item is very importante to hold for any function do you needed."
Apparel,5.0,me encanta....,"hello excellent article, packed all my expectations, an unused item with great quality and finish, the service was very warm and Rapides, and recommend it when I can buy more, I give you my word these people know what it does, buy here. ..!"
Apparel,5.0,Cool,This watch looks good. I hope this works well too. I bought this as a b'day gift to my best buddy.
Apparel,5.0,pretty for causal wearing,"it fits perfectly for young girls.  Just a bit cheap-looking with the plastic back.  But at this price $65 around, one has no regret."
Apparel,5.0,RAM is the best,"All of these mounts are solid, vibration free even on a motorcycle and flexible enough to position items conveniently. I used this one for an X-grip to mount my cell phone."
Apparel,3.0,"Great watch, horrible shipping job","Love the watch, just glad it was for me and not a gift for someone else, because the box it came in was smashed to pieces."
Apparel,1.0,Disappointed!!,"I bought this for my husband who loves Pink Floyd, but it broke within the first day.  It was hardly used and it fell apart!"
Apparel,3.0,Really Small,The quality of the watch was poor and it felt really cheap and was very small. Not worth the money and the stones tend to fall off.
Apparel,5.0,Highly recommend it.,"As usual it was delivered a day late, but I am thrilled with this watch and it was worth the wait.  It is lightweight - sometimes I don't even know I'm wearing one, and it's very pretty.  I was hoping it would be one of the thin watches, but it's not particularly big and it's very comfortable.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pretty watch that can be worn for special occasions or every day."
Apparel,5.0,"Love it,",I purchased this watch back in 2008 for my wife and she loves it. Swatch is one of the very best swiss made watches which its prices are afordable and make no mistake swatch last longer.
Apparel,3.0,Super light but sweet Swatch,"This Swatch is more of a bangle bracelet. It fits me quite large. The face of it was scratched but I needed a watch so I'm not going through the trouble of returning it. The colors are very sweet pastel and it is easy to read. Look forward to wearing it. I may take it to the Swatch store and have them take out some links, I can put it on without even unlatching it."
Apparel,5.0,Children like,"Buy gifts for children, children like it very much, very beautiful。Whether accurate as also don't know, use for a period of time and have a look。"
Apparel,4.0,"Bought it for $30, Good for the price","The watch looks really beautiful and pretty for a girl. Keep in mind that the watch is really small and the dial is plastic, but if you have small wrist or the person you are going to give it has small wrist this is the way to go. Luckily, my gf has a small wrist which the watch looks pretty on her wrist. I got it for $30 dollars, i knew something was off, then when the package came, the box was broken , it have crack on the cover,  but the watch was intact and safe.  For $30 dollars what can you expect?"
Apparel,5.0,i like it,This watch looks good. I hope this works well too. I bought this as a b'day gift to my best buddy.
Apparel,5.0,The perfect watch,I've looking for michael kors watch for a while but I could not decide which one I wanted until I saw this watch. Gorgeous and it looks spectacular. I'm in love with it. My husband loved it and in an affordable price. I recommend it.
Apparel,3.0,Very nice...love it.,Beautiful watch...need to have some links remove to fit my small wrist...I gave a 3 because no bill of sale received
Apparel,5.0,All is well.,Nice watch and good quality. Except the watch band is too too long.I have to buy tools to fix it.
Apparel,4.0,Just Gorgeous!,"I just adore my new authentic MK watch! I received lots compliments. However,  I have to have a few links removed.  Overall great product and I would definitely be a  returning customer!"
Apparel,5.0,"a true beauty, i wear it every single day","Just what i expected and then some. Even more beautiful in person. Big, bold fashion statement. Love love love it"
Apparel,5.0,Beautiful watch,Watch is beautful and exactly as it appears online. This watch is a value as it is a significant savings over prices in stores.
Apparel,1.0,cheap,"Really, it is what you pay for, the center is plastic, not glass as it appears.  Really crappy thing, have no idea how to shorten the band. It sits on the counter, never used it."
Apparel,2.0,Goldtone fades after a few wears.,The goldtone on these watches fades and the steel shows through.  This after only 5 wearings. I would not buy this watch again because it will look nice for a short time.
Apparel,5.0,Perfect gift for a special someone,"This watch is the perfect accessorie for a clasical style, it can be use for many event and many situations,<br />being formal causal o sporty"
Apparel,4.0,Fit for the purpose,"While the DSC HX50v is an aim-and-shoot camera, the camera design combined with this case will change the game a bit.  It feels like I have gone 20 years back in time.  This said, the jacket / case is a good fit.  It protects, to an extent, from falls, and dust.  You can charge the camera and connect it to your computer with the covers on.  The leather used to make this is not genuine, which I cannot complain about as we are seeing less genuine leather in cars, bags, and a few other things.  Overall, I like it,"
Apparel,5.0,Beautiful,"Excellent product, good quality, the design is great, I recommended 100%. Is a nice watch. My wife is very happy with his watch."
Apparel,5.0,Very comfortable,"I have a very large watch collection,from cheap to high end. This watch fits into my rotation very well. the silicone strap is comfortable and resembles leather. Very happy with this watch."
Apparel,5.0,Reliable Choice,"Like many others in the Swatch line, this timepiece is attractive, has a comfortable strap and is easy to read. Because of its reasonable price, it can be part of your Swatch collection, worn to match a particular outfit or a particular occasion. This version with the black face and vibrant red strap has become a goto selection for me."
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Quality anx beautiful
Apparel,5.0,Get it!,"Love the watch. I originally saw it at the New York Airport at the Swatch store. I really liked the fact that they are water resistant and the rubber strap is very nice and comfortable. I bought it from Amazon a lot cheaper then at the Swatch store, saved me like $30. awesome fit and feel."
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,good
Apparel,5.0,A good choice for a lady who likes a little sparkle,I collect Swatch watches and received this as a gift from my husband. It's pretty and dainty but fun and modern. It can dress up an outfit or be worn everyday as a little sparkle and personality to any attire.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,excellent
Apparel,5.0,As Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She loved it.,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Michael Kors watches are hot now and I got this one at a reasonable price.<br /><br />If my girlfriend is happy, of course I'm happy."
Apparel,5.0,Beautiful and elegant,Beautiful and elegant.  It was a gift for my sister who is small and petite.  The piece is a bit large but not too big considering the current style.  She loved it.
Apparel,4.0,"Good watch, not great","Good watch, not great. The crystal is plastic, prone to scratches<br />The band is plastic, causes me to sweat more. Will change it out for a leather one, but it love the orange band....<br />Face is large and easy to read by my aging eyes!<br />Amazon price was great."
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Very good and I'm so happy.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,very nice

Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Excelente
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Lindo!
Apparel,5.0,BEST WATCH I'VE OWNED!,"I bought this watch at a high end jewelry store in Switzerland.  I love love love this watch!  I had Swatches as a teenager...the plastic band kind, and I thought it would be neat to buy one in the country where they originate.  I've worn this watch almost every day for over 5 years.  Yes, it has a few scratches on the face, but nothing that's really noticeable.  I've only changed the battery once.  And yes, the ticking is loud to some, but that's what Swatch is known for!  I did have a couple links removed at the jewelry store where I bought it, so those who say it can't be done are wrong!  Buy this watch if you're looking for something a little dressy with a bit of bling!  You won't be disappointed!"
Apparel,2.0,Two Stars,I live in Virginia. After three weeks its screen became foggy while it claims it is waterproof.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Prettier than picture..
Apparel,5.0,better material and feel than I thought!,A lovely addition to my keychain.  Perfect gift for any Pink Floyd lover!
Apparel,4.0,this is a very beautiful watch. the color and detail is amazing,"this is a very beautiful watch. the color and detail is amazing. a very classic and elegant watch. my boyfriend loves it, he thinks it's a guy watch because of it's size. which is the only down fall, it has a lot of weight to it, but the price of beauty."
Apparel,1.0,One Star,"it was good for a while, once my keys fall down and this keychain broke"
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Very classy love it one link too big though
Apparel,1.0,Very said because it's a beautiful watch. Returning asap,"When I pulled the watch out of the box, the links just fell apart.  Had it put back together, and they fell apart again! Very said because it's a beautiful watch. Returning asap!"
Apparel,5.0,Excellent,Excellent and unexpensive
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,very good
Apparel,5.0,"Face scratches easily, but this is the only downside","I have this watch for almost 5 years. No crystals have been detached yet. I changed a battery twice. Face scratches easily, but this is the only downside. I am very pleased with a quality."
Apparel,2.0,Cute but cheap,This watch is cute but cheap. If you are used to good quality or heavier watches it will be an adjustment. I most likely will not purchase a watch of this brand again.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect!
Apparel,5.0,I'm confident he will really like it.,"Jury is still out on this one. Got it as a Christmas gift for my grandson, I'm confident he will really like it."
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Its great. I love it!
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Apparel,5.0,amazingwatch fast,amazing watch fast shipping
Apparel,1.0,Crumby packaging,I was very disappointed in the way I recieved this product. First of all the plastic case it came in was all scuffed up and the plastic case was also broken so it won't stay shut. And the watch was ticking away so who knows how long the battery will last now. It looks like it was probably returned by someone and then sent to me. I chose not to return it because it is an Xmas gift and I would not have had time to send it back and get a new one. The watch itself seemed to be okay.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,This was my first Micheal Kors watch and it is absolutely stunning!!! Loving it!!
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Great watch!
Apparel,5.0,This watch is exactly as promised. It is light ...,This watch is exactly as promised.  It is light on my wrist.  Flashy without being too dressy.  The right size for small wrists.

Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,great!
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Very Good
Apparel,2.0,i like the watch very much-typical Swatch…lightweight and comfortable,"i like the watch very much-typical Swatch…lightweight and comfortable.  However, the one that was sent to me tells time accurately but the day of the week does not work, so it will forever be Tuesday when i wear this watch.  Not great to see on a new product but otherwise like it very much."
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,great watch! It arrived on time :)
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Fits perfeect! gets so much compliments.
Apparel,4.0,You get what you pay for,"Most Swatch watches are cheap, durable, practical, and handsome.  This one's no different, really.  I work with a lot of folks who wear flashy, expensive watches, and yet my orange band Swatch seems to be the only one that catches anyone's notice.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tells the time.<br />- Handsome.<br />- Orange is cool.<br />- Durable.<br />- Battery is super accessible.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Visibly cheap.<br />- I would've liked some form of illumination for checking the time in the dark."
Apparel,5.0,Love it arrived as promised Betty Zimmer,Love it  arrived as promised<br />Betty Zimmer
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,is expected and recommend the product
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,muy bueno
Apparel,2.0,Beautiful watch!,It is wonderful!
Apparel,4.0,Great buy. Pretty snazzy and,Husband likes it. Wears it everyday to his construction job and it hasn't fallen apart. Great buy. Pretty snazzy and different
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Swiss quality and McDonald's price.  Looks great
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Gorgeous!
Apparel,4.0,Pretty watch.,Pretty watch. I took out some links to shorten the bracelet....would take to a jewlery next time. I wish the silver was not quite as bright looking.  Numbers on dial a tad hard to see for this ol' gal.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,good watch
Apparel,2.0,Get a BlackRapid SNAPR-20 instead,"I have this case in green, from my Limited Edition Ricoh GR, and while it does the job of holding the camera, the worst thing about this case is how the flap comes off so easily.<br /><br />It snaps to the back of the case using two snap buttons, and I've almost lost it (the flap) countless times. I have zero confidence in attaching this case to my belt, and am constantly worried about it coming off while I'm on the go.<br /><br />I have no idea why Ricoh would come up with such a poor design for this case, when a simple loop (similar to what handgun holsters have) would do a far better job keeping the camera securely in the case - it's not as though this flap is going to do a great job of keeping out water and dust."
Apparel,4.0,"Awesome watch, cool band, but the face is too big for the average woman's arm.","Very cool watch. I'm a Giants fan and I thought this is an awesome black and orange watch. I loved the band too. However, I am not petite in any way and this watch says it's unisex, but I'm so bummed because the face is just too darn big.  So I've returned it. 😕"
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Great watch..love Swatch! It's a perfect watch for everyday use.
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,Great watch! Love it! Swim in the pool or take a shower and still looks brand new!
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,My wife loves it!
Apparel,4.0,Four Stars,I like it
Apparel,5.0,Five Stars,"Great watch, my girl loved it!!"
Baby,5.0,Works fine.,"Does what it's supposed to do, doesn't leak.  I find it very convenient that you can turn your bottles into storage containers. I recommend the whole Avent line from the pump to these sealers."
Baby,1.0,Had hoped it would be good,"This mobile looked and sounded (from the description) like a great mobile.  Our son loves to watch things move and loves animals.  Unfortunately the music was SO soft even on the loudest setting and the mobile itself was SOOOO slow that it would not keep his attention at all.  Looks like a great mobile but just didn't live up to its description.  Also, if you have a crib that does not have straight sides (e.g. there are some curves) the mobile attaches to it but it's very temperamental when it comes to the movement - you have to move the mobile to try to get it to work.  Not the best unfortunately."
Baby,4.0,Son loves it,"My son loves this mobile, it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around."
Baby,2.0,Child loves mobile but two were defective,"Our daughter loves the mobile, she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals. Unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed, none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds. The sound is also very soft."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"We bought this for my 3 month old son and he loves it.  There are many nights that he has fallen asleep by watching the peek a boo leaves open and close.  I think the level of volume is perfect.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little hesitant to order it, but remember- <br />It is not supposed to stimulate your baby!  It is to lul them to sleep!  I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs. <br />I would recommend this product-like I said I love it!"
Baby,5.0,My son loves this mobile!,"This mobile sends him off to sleep every time.  I love that the music lasts so long--with the wind up ones, he would just start to settle down when it would shut off.  There are two volume levels; usually the quieter one is enough for bedtime.  My only (minor) complaint is that the remote control for it makes a loud clicking sound when you press it (enough to make him stir, but not wake up)."
Baby,5.0,I chose this one because it's soothing,"I compared reviews on this mobile along with the TinyLove mobile called Symphony in Motion and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile.  I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is.  And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well.  Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too.  In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed.  She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round.  But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime.  My husband and I are VERY pleased with this purchase."
Baby,5.0,I want one!!,"If they made one of these things for adults, I'd get one!!  My daughter LOVES this thing.  It's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love, and spins really easily. The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands.  I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these!"
Baby,5.0,held head up in days,"My newborn hated tummy time on the floor. Would lay his head down and just cry, just like my daughter had. I bought the lamaze spin and explore, and he loved it. Within days, he could hold his head all the way up for minutes at a time, and now that he is four months old, he spins himself around playing with the different toys attached. Great buy!"
Baby,4.0,Plenty loud enough,"Check to see if the crib or play-yard you intend this for will actually work with it.  When mine didn't, I decided to attach it (secure and safe) to my headboard.  Curious about reports that it's not loud enough, I laid down and had a listen.  It's plenty loud enough, even at a distance of 2.5 feet overhead.  Remember, your infant hasn't spent time in front of the speakers at a Counting Crows concert!  When the baby (9 weeks old) finally got a shot at it, he was enchanted, stimulated, very excited.  So much for soothing -- but it's wonderful to know that while I'm having to fold laundry he's watching the bright colors and listening to lovely music.  A great addition to the day with baby..."
Baby,5.0,Daughter LOVES This Mobile!,"My little girl has had this mobile in her crib since she was a couple weeks old and she has always loved it. She used to just watch the animals move around and fall asleep to the soothing music. Now she will turn her head to watch the base when it lights up. This was a great buy for us. My only complaint would be the little remote that comes with it. The clicker is very loud... which, if you are using the remote, it's because you are trying to turn the mobile on without being seen and the loud click gets my girl's attention every time. We just don't use the clicker anymore but the fact remains that she loves the mobile itself. She'll be bummed when we have to take it down!"
Baby,5.0,Love it!!!!,I love this mobile so much that I ended up buying one for my 3 month old niece.  They love it too!!  This is one of the best mobiles because of the movements and the colors as well as the fact that you still have a little night light with a music box when you detatch the mobile part.  Not to mention that it plays music for close to 20 minutes.  My 13 month old loves it (and so does my 4 year old).  He is just mesmerized by it when he's tired and amused with it when he wakes up and turns it on after he's done sleeping.   <br /> <br />I was a little reluctant about this mobile when I read some reviews about it being too quiet.  I wanted to set the record straight.  The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be?  I think that the volume is perfect but if you prefer to make it louder or the house is loud you can switch it to a louder volume but we always keep it on the softest and it's just fine. <br />I highly recommend this mobile.
Baby,5.0,Great Mobile,"As a new mom I was looking for something that would hold my daughter's interest.My 1 month old daughter loves this mobile. We put it on her crib & she slept there the entire night without a fuss. The night light is just right to soothe & the sound level is perfect. During the day, I get my work done with her totally occupied with the bright colours & \\""jungle\\"" sounds. Easy to assemble & great price...couldn't ask for better. My only problem with it, are the batteries..it eats them up, solved that problem by using recharables. <br />All in all, one fantastic mobile."
Baby,4.0,mobile,"My only complaint is that the remote is loud, so we never use it.  The music is great, although, some of the music is programmed under the wrong composer.  Oh well.  I guess the babies aren't reading the composers' names anyway!"
Baby,1.0,disappointed,I have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing.  Child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her.  I will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck.
Baby,5.0,So cute and very durable!,"The colors on the product are awesome, the blanket feels very soft and got different toys on the different paddles, I wished they'd make something bigger for adults like that *haha*! The spintable with it is very good sized, supercute im Ladybug design adn spins very easily! though not meant for Toddlers my son gave it a try to and the Spinner did not even squeach under his 42lbs, nor break and still spun if he managed to keep all of his much bigger then a Babies limbs of the floor!<br /><br />My 6 month old daughter still fits on this toy very well at almost 26inches tall and 17lbs. She is fascinated by the colors just like me and loves the mirror especially whis is on one of the paddles fixed on Velcro!<br /><br />Like my son she does not like Tummytime very much either,and this toy doesn't seem to make it much better, but htat has NOTHING to do with the Toy. She just doesn't like being on her Tummy, probably since she has reflux! The spintable is very well formed lower on the hippart and a tinybit higher where she shoulders go, so she doens't mind the spin table, she just does not like lifting  her head out of the floorposition, so she doesn't stay much longer on this one on her Tummy then she would otherwise but we'll keep trying!<br /><br />The flowermat I wished would be bigger, it is as big as described in the productlisting, but just for me I'm thinking to myself it wouldn't hurt to make the mat twice as big as it is, if a Baby doesn't like the spinner it can still use the beautyful flowermat for rolling around and checking things out ect.!<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone it really is worth trying just don't give up!"
Baby,5.0,Great option for infants who hate tummy time!,"There weren't many things my daughter did not like...but, tummy time was a nightmare.  Until, that is, I purchased this wonderful gym.  I suspected that she would like it becasue she is naturally curious- and I was right.  She squeals with delight as she spins herlself around....and that makes me very happy!"
Baby,5.0,lamaze spin and explore garden gym,"I ordered this for my Grandchild who is now 4 months old and his parents tell me he loves it. It keeps him busy, its good quality . I would reccommend this item ."
Baby,5.0,Great product,"My baby loves this new gadget which makes tummy time a fun activity. We started using it at 3 month and he was able to hold his head up for a minute at first, but I guess it strengthen his neck muscle  pretty well because he is able to enjoy it for at least 5 to 10 minutes at 4 month. Kids that young only spin themselves accidentely, but he loved the bright colors and the cringing sound of the fabric his hands touch. He also loves when I spin him around. I can't wait to see when he will discover that he can do it by himself. I would recomend this toy, and since two parts are detachable, you can use a mat by itself for senses explorations."
Baby,3.0,Nice mobile but way too quiet,"Our twins have two different mobiles to keep things interesting. While they enjoy watching this one move, they soon lose interest. I think it's because you can barely hear the music. Another problem is that the remote clicking is so loud that it defeats the purpose. What I do like are the cute and colorful animals and the nice movements. It's pretty good product, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they turn up the volume quite a bit. Overall - attractive, but disappointing."
Baby,2.0,Very uncomfortable,"I bought this playmat for my 8 week old and she hated it. Everytime I put her on it, she would get uncomfortable and cry. I guess it would work better with babies who have already developed enough neck support."
Baby,5.0,Lamaze Garden Gym-Tummy Time Toy,"We received the garden gym as a gift and loved it instantly.  Even though it was a little early, I would place my 3 week old on it and just spin her around, playing with each item.  The fact that it was an \\""activity\\"" and she didn't cry made it an instant hit in our house.  Now that she is almost four months old, she is enjoying it even more.  Its a great alternative to an activity mat, as the babies can actually see the colors and toys, while the \\""potato chip\\"" spinner allows them to see a variety of things as opposed to being stuck with one vision.  I will definately buy this gift for all of my friends who have new babies."
Baby,5.0,Tummy time life saver,"I read about this product in a parenting magazine and immediately decided to purchase it.  I looked on several web sites and read many reviews before coming to Amazon to buy.  This is one of the top 3 purchases I've made for my child!!!  Before this little item came along my daughter would scream in frustration during tummy time and become almost inconsolable if we tried it for more than 2 minutes.  I did every conceivable thing to make tummy time better for her with no luck.  The moment I put her on the spinner she was interested and alert, NO CRYING!  Naturally we started slowly with 5 minute intervals and have been working our time up but the fact that there are no more tears of frustration makes this thing worth it's weight in gold."
Baby,4.0,Great Mobile,"This mobile really is nice because its great for a boy!  I was finding a lot of the mobiles out there were kind of girly.  The mobile is soothing, colorful and is just great.  However, if there is only one thing I could change it would be the volume.  It has 2 volume settings however, they are both low.  That is why I only gave this mobile 4 stars.  Other wise its perfect!"
Baby,1.0,Waste of my money,"My son was/is not interested in this product. He may tolerate it  for a minute or 2, but that's not worth $40 to me. I was really excited about this, in hopes that he would enjoy his tummy time more, but that just was not the case."
Baby,5.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mobile!","Did I mention I LOVE this mobile....more importantly my daughter LOVES this mobile.  After buying an endless supply of baby things to occupy my daughter even long enough to get the bottles washed, it all comes back to this mobile.  She is mesmerized by it and has a kicking good time in her crib because of it.  I don't have volume issues like others here, and the selection of music is great--although she seems to prefer Beethoven :)  In fact, if a ruckus is being heard from that direction, nine times out of ten it is because the music/motion has stopped.  A simple re-start does the trick.  I am serious.  I can get as much as an hour to do things around the house.  This is worth every penny, and knowing what I do now about it, I would have paid double!"
Baby,4.0,a very beautiful toy,"I like this mobile, the leaves moving up and down, the animals slowly moving around. this is lovely, with soft music for baby, and even a little night light. This is a gorgeous exotic looking mobile. It is pleasant to look at and always catches my sons eye.<br /><br /> This does run on big batteries, not included. It requires some assembly. I was able to put it together :) must have a philps screwdriver.<br /><br /> The music is ok, but none of the music is listed under the correct composer, that isn't a serious problem at all, but something worth noting. Mozart plays bach, Bach plays Beethoven, Beethoven plays Mozart. This is a good quality product, just what I wanted, and I think i love it more than my son does."
Baby,4.0,ehhh....,"This is a nice toy, and very innovative.  We bought it for my second child. However, I don't think it sped up any developmental progress in comparison to the first child.  He does have fun on it though and it gives him something to do while I am chasing his older brother around."
Baby,3.0,Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym,I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym for my daughter of 2 months. The toy said it could be used from day one. I was upset to know that is not the case. If the child is not capable of maintaining its head held upright it just soft of squirms and wobbles on the toy and cries for help. This toy should be rated 3 months and up not zero to 5. Other than that the price was great and my daughter really enjoys looking at the colors of the toy even if she cant play with it yet.[[ASIN:B000I2MRHE Lamaze  Spin & Explore Garden Gym]]
Baby,5.0,Absolutely love it!,"I was so excited when I purchased this that I brought it home and attached it to the crib immediately.  It was so easy to put together and even easier at entertaining my daughter.  The colors are so vibrant and the animals just loveable.  The music is soothing with the volume just loud enough for sensitive baby ears.  I can lay my daughter down in her crib and her rainforest friends keep her busy while I get things done.  She smiles at them and talks to them and it is such pure joy watching it.  I don't know who enjoys this mobile more.....baby, my husband, or myself.  It is a must have for all families."
Baby,3.0,Its ok,"This toy is a good idea, sort of. My daughter loved, and still plays with, the matt itself. But as a GERD baby (throws up a lot) the spin toy didnt meet her approval. For one, it was a bit hard to lay on. Also, the curved bug - although cute - was either too long when she was at the target age for learning what its designed for, or too small for her body once she got long enough to fit. *She is 6 months old and 17lbs now*. I would put her in it every day, and she would scream until she would vomit. More, the bug's antanee would get in her eyes. Once she got used to it, she still didnt find it very entertaining.     On the whole, I think its a good idea that needed more work. Its cute, the matt is still very useful, but the spinner in our house just sits in the corner, or holds toys. Maybe it will come in handy later but for now its not being used for what it was intended.     As always, your results may vary - but if your child doesnt like laying on their face, this toy may not help that in my opinion."
Baby,5.0,Great Parent Tray For Multiple strollers!!,"I have many strollers, and all of them were made without a parent/snack tray!!! I LOVE this! I can use it on my Mac volo, Quinny Zapp, Infinity stroller, and (the reason I bought it) for My Mountain Buggy!!  Buy it, You will love finally having a place for your cell phone, keys, snacks, and drinks!!  A+!!!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"I did a very thorough search of crib mobiles and their capabilities before I bought this one.  I am very pleased with the results of this one.  The mobile itself has 3 volume settings options (no sound, quiet, or louder), several music options in addition to a \\""rainforest\\"" sound of birds chirping, owls hooting, and crickets making noise (my favorite setting, as it seems to sooth my 3 month old to sleep quickly), an option to have the night light on or off, and various combination options (i.e., light or no light with sound or no sound).  The rainforest characters are very colorful and, in addition to the leaves going up and down, the orbital movements of the characters makes my daughter very fascinated.  This mobile really started getting the quiet, peaceful attention of my daughter when she was 8 weeks old.  Now at 13 weeks old, the mobile still gets used daily as she transitions off to sleep."
Baby,4.0,Pretty cool mobile,"This mobile is pretty impressive.  I loved how easy it was to put together and it attaches to the crib very easily!  The leaves move and I think that is way cool, however I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of the music.  The rainforest sounds are great though and I love the remote...how convenient!  Also, the whole thing is pretty large and rather cumbersome, but since it comes apart pretty easily it shouldn't be too much of a problem to store.  All in all though we were pretty pleased with this purchase."
Baby,5.0,4 1/2 month old granddaughter loved it,"My 4 1/2 month old granddaughter really loves this - she is not able to sit up by herself, but the seat is deep enough to hold her upright with no problem---the only issue I had with it is the width of the seat bottom that comes up between her legs - it is so wide that I had to bunch it together after I put her in it, so that her legs would hang evenly - she can only touch the bottom of the floor with the tips of her toes (and I have it on the lowest setting) but she can still bounce - she is fascinated with all the toys - there are so many interesting things on this gym to keep her entranced.  It was also very easy to put together - the directions can get a little fuzzy, but common sense prevails.  It is well worth the money for the enjoyment she is having and also it will last her for quite some time.  Alot safer to me than the johnny jump-ups that hang from the doorways."
Baby,4.0,Great attachment,"I really like this a lot. I love that i can move it easily from one stoller to another. It holds what I need and has a little mesh zipper part for my keys & cash. i also like that i can take it off and throw in the bottom of my stroller when parking it at theme parks, the aqaurium etc. I would have rated it a 5 but the only thing I don't love is that the straps should have an attachemet or extender so it fits double joggers better. I have to put it on side  when i have it n my double jogger and it looks funny, but functions great."
Baby,4.0,Colorful and entertaining,"My daughter just turned 3 months old and usually screams within 1 min of being put on her tummy. When I have put her on the tummy time mats with the pillow she usually finds a way to push herself off of it and screams with her face in the pillow. This is a neat idea. She fits perfect on the seat that spins. She is 23 inches long. That mat though is very small, much smaller than I thought it would be. The toys are fun. My daughter really has no interest in the toys yet, but does love the mirror. When I put her on it for the first time she smiled and laughed and watched herself in the mirror for about 5 minutes before she started to cry. I figure that is pretty good for a first try. She has only had it for a few days and still only stays on for about 5 minutes. She has not learned to spin yet. She enjoys me laying her on her back to the spinner and spinning her around the room though. Overall this is a fun toy for her to play on with or w/o the spinner. I think she will enjoy this toy when she is able to sit on her own. I don't think though that this will help her learn to crawl like good old fashion tummy time."
Baby,3.0,good idea,"I have a Maclaren Triumph that I really like but wished it had cupholders... this organizer does the trick.  You do have to put it on and take it off each time you use it since the stroller won't fold with it attached but its worth it to have somewhere to throw your keys and cell phone.  I will say this... since its not attached permanently it does move a bit so bottled water with the cap on is your best bet as far as a beverage goes, or a soda bottle with a cap.  An open can of soda sloshed around a bit while walking."
Baby,5.0,Very nice to have,Before I received these we were mixing formula in one bottle and trasfering the milk into another...with these you can mix and heat and then stick a nipple on it and you're good to go.  Easy to clean and use... love them!
Baby,5.0,Lamaze Gym,Great product. I gave this as a gift and it was the biggest hit at the Baby Shower.
Baby,4.0,"we love this item, but ....","we love this item, but i'll be better to have A/C power and battery options, battery runs fast if chose lights too. Thanks"
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"My son loved the mobile when he was younger.  He would watch the animals go around and the leaves move up and down.  As he got older, I took off the mobile and kept the music part attached to his crib.  I don't know why people are saying the music is too soft.  I have it set at the lowest level, and it still puts my son to sleep.  When he wakes up, he likes to turn it on and lay in his crib and listen to it in the morning."
Baby,5.0,Great toy for tummy time hating babies!,"My little one has never been interested in tummy time.  I purchased this in hopes of making it a little more exciting for him and it worked!  He loves looking at himself in the mirror or listening to the crinkle of the leaves or wings when his hands move over them.  I know he's not meaning to just yet, but he's been able to move himself around and has been able to enjoy all the sections of this gym.    I would highly recommend it for babies who are less than happy with tummy time!"
Baby,5.0,Tummy time,"We bought this cute playmat to make tummy time a little more enjoyable for our 10 week old. She seems to like it for about 5 minutes and then she needs a break. The cute ladybug stool cradles your baby's torso and helps prevent them from rolling off. She likes all of the little activities each \\""flower petal\\"" offers but I'd have to say the \\""crinkly\\"" sound the leaves make seem to be her favorite. Or maybe she just likes the leave because she can get a good grasp on them and rotate herself around. I was a little surprised at how small the mat is but I'm sure it'll give our daughter lots of fun tummy time despite the size. I wish they had this when we had our other daughter 5 years ago."
Baby,4.0,Excellent Beginning Toy For Babies,"Fisher-Price is well known for making toys that \\""grow\\"" with their toughest critics, babies.  The Fisher-Price Rainforest 123 Musical Gym is no exception.  My son is four months old, and he loves to lie on his back and swat at the toucan rattle, butterflies, and tiger music box.  He coos and giggles while he plays with them.  There's also a giraffe and palm tree that he likes to look at.  As he grows older and begins to lie on his belly more, there's another rattle, a mirror, and a peek-a-boo toy to play with as well.  There's even a headrest that can move along with the child as they grow.<br /><br />This toy focuses on development of large motor skills.  The ability for the toy to \\""grow\\"" with the child makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion.  I recommend it to families with babies who are at least two or three months old."
Baby,4.0,Keeps baby happy,Our soon to be 4 month old loves it.  The animals spin around and the leaves flap up and down. We like it because its quiet (unlike most baby toys).    It would really be nice if it had a clamp rather than having to screw it down through the crib rails.  It was a bit of a challenge to find a good place for installation and avoid scratching up the crib.  A clamp would also let it work with a pack and plays.  We cut a hole in a washcloth and used it like a screw washer over the plastic nut.
Baby,2.0,Didn't Work for Our Baby,"The 'idea' of this product seems perfect - baby is cradled by a \\""saddle\\"" on a turntable that allows him to develop the neck and back strength he needs to crawl. Sounds great on paper, but in practice this thing was like a torture device for my little one. It seems to me that there is a very small window of time when the saddle would be useful and safe for baby. It's that time after he has the considerable neck and back strength to maintain the position - arms extended straight down and locked, head lifted high and steady, and legs extended straight back - but before he is able to crawl. If your baby can do what the baby in the picture for this product can do, he will literally be crawling within a couple of weeks, if he isn't already, and he will spend most of his time trying to wriggle off of the thing. But what if your baby hasn't reached that point yet and still needs to put his head down every few seconds? It flops over the front of the saddle, straining baby's neck and back. When I figured that out, I immediately packed this back up and took it back to the store. The playmat can be used without the saddle, but I was unimpressed with that as well. The felt-like material attracted every little piece of dust and pet hair in our home like a magnet. I'm not sure what this accomplishes that a simple tummy-time pillow under baby's chest would not - and the pillow is a lot safer, less expensive and more comfortable for baby."
Baby,5.0,Great product,"This is exactly what I needed for my umbrella stroller. We live near Disney and go quite frequently. I wanted an umbrella stroller but missed the drink holders.    This attaches easily with the velcro. I also like that I can put my keys, cell phone or some snacks in the middle."
Baby,5.0,Absolutely LOVE it!!!!,"My 4 month old daughter loves the spin and play garden. It's the perfect tummy time play mat!!! I just wish it had been around when my son was that little. He's 19 months old and plays with his sister with the attached toys. It's a must have for any new baby! It is well built and even stands up to my son's not so gentle touch. It stores easy when not in use, and is easy to clean. This is definately worth the money you pay for it. I just can't help but sing the praises of this wonderful toy!!!!"
Baby,3.0,Cute Idea...,My daughter is now 5 months old and has had this for about 2 months. She's not too thrilled w/it yet but each time I put her on she plays a little bit longer. I think w/in the next few weeks when she has a bit more strength and body control that she'll enjoy it more. I have purchased a baby play mat that has a small U shaped pillow that velcros to it and she definately spends more time on her tummy on that.
Baby,4.0,Low Muscle tone help?,"I bought this for my daughter who has Down syndrome and isn't crawling yet (9.5 months).  She has very low muscle tone, and I thought that this would help her use her arms and legs while it held her body up for her, since she can't do that herself.  It works great; however, I was kind of upset to find that the weight limit for the center portion is only 22 pounds.  She loves the playmat,and we'll still get use out of it after she exceeds the 22 pound mark.  Had I known that limit, I may not have purchased it because she's pretty close to 22 now. For a \\""normal\\"" baby, though, this seems like a great product."
Baby,5.0,Life saver!,"I had doubts about this product first because i have two strollers, each with completely different types of handles. But it fit perfectly to both of my Quinny zapp and Quinny speedi strollers. I can put my keys, phone, water bottle etc. I don't like carrying bags so this is a life saver for me."
Baby,5.0,great for tummy time!!!!,My 3 month old little girl was getting a flat side on her head and hated doing tummy time to correct it.  I thought this toy was great to help her do tummy time and gave her new toys to play with.  I also think it helped build neck and head control.
Baby,5.0,"Wonderful, soothing music with a night light, and doesn't eat batteries either!!","We have consistently used this mostly as a night light and music for every nap, and every night at bedtime (since day one) for my now 6-month old son.  Still have not had to change the 'D' batteries, so that's a big plus.  We didn't run the mobile very often, because I only used it for naps and night time, and we keep his room very dark, so he couldn't see the mobile most of the time; however, between 2-4 months of age, when I did put him in his crib to play, he did seem to really like the mobile.  The editor's description is incorrect--there IS a volume control (soft or softer), I use the lower volume unless it's daytime and very noisy down the hall like when I'm doing laundry or something, and no problems hearing it."
Baby,5.0,Worth It,"When I bought this I was somewhat hesitant for 2 reasons- it's high price & because I really wanted one with bold primary colors.  At the time all the mobiles I saw for sale we pastel with \\""critters\\"" that faced up (baby sees bottom only) & were strictly wind up.    We use this mobile on our baby's bassinet.  The way it attaches may limit what it can be attached to.  My husband had a hard time getting it on securely.  Eventually he was successful.    We use this item throughout the day every day.  Our 9 week old loves it.  The mobile circulates as most do; however, this mobile has additional movement as the leaves go up and down.  This is eye catching for the infant.  Also- if you turn it off while the leaves are in the down position it makes it very compact.    The base which attaches to the crib is bulky.  It has a light, also eye catching, & sounds.  There are 4 different sounds.  One of which is a soothing jungle background (others are Midi type music).  Our infant enjoys this because it has an interesting monkey call.  If the room you are using this mobile in has any background noise the mobile seems too quiet even on the loudest setting.  In a quiet room the loudest setting seems loud (the lowest is fine).  You have the ability to turn the light on or off.  The same for the music.    The battery life seems to be good on this item.  It has an auto shut off feature that can be your friend or foe.  It saves you in batteries but can upset a child engaged in it's movements!  Luckily it has a remote you can use to quickly turn it back on (though it never seems to be near when I am busy)!    To my surprise - it was worth the money."
Baby,1.0,22 lb weight limit,This item seems like a great idea only my son has almost reached the weight limit of 22 lbs. at only 5 months old. This is about the time a baby would only start to enjoy such a toy. And the flower part is not big enough all the way around for him to be able to see everything on it. You also have to make sure you don't feed the baby right before putting them on this because they will spit up as it pushes on their tummies too much.
Baby,3.0,Great product that works for a short while...,"This tummy time \\""toy\\"" is great for a small period between the newborn and crawling timeframes.  If can be used as soon as your baby is able to lift her head up and have decent control (i.e., head isn't too wobbly).    The base spins and allows the baby to see different sections of the mat.  Now, from the picture, it looks as though the baby will be able to spin themselves, but for us that was not the case as my son was not able to push hard enough to spin himself.  So the spinning part will be left to the parents.  He also didn't interact too much with the toys attached to the mat, but that may just be him.  My son loved the section with the mirror and one with a worm on it, but the mat didn't seem to increase his ability/willingness to endure tummy time, but he did seem more content during it.    As soon as he was able to start spinning himself, he as just about to crawl and we preferred putting him flat on the ground and letting him get onto all fours to rock on his hands and knees or army crawl.    Bottom line:  I don't know if its worth getting... any other flat playmat will serve the same purpose..."
Baby,1.0,"My granddaughter cried everytime we put her on it, she's 5 months","We had hoped this would make tummy time a happy time, instead it seemed to make her so mad and uncomfortable, I just put it back in the box after 3 tries even adding padding for her stomach.  I do not recommend this for any baby, not if they have the same reaction like my granddaughter."
Baby,5.0,Bottle Sealers,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent."
Baby,4.0,Wonderful!,I wanted something to make my umbrella strollers more mom friendly when traveling.  This was the item I had been looking for.  It simply velcros to the bars and when I had to gate check the stroller I took it off and put it in the stroller as I folded it up. I am very glad that I had them along! Now I don't have to worry about using my big stroller just because it has cup holders.
Baby,3.0,Bulky,"I found it hard to get this mobile on the crib.  I am worried it will fall on the baby!  It's a heavy base. I actually used floss to help secure it.  I like the mobile, though.  It's intricate so I'm not sure how durable it is.  My 2 month-old likes it."
Baby,5.0,Tummy Time,"I think this product is great.. I bought it for my son who was 3 1/2 months old at the time.. The pediatrician said he needed to do tummy time 4x a day.. He hated tummy time so I got him this in hopes he would change his outlook on it.. He has, he is almost 5 months now and he love it, he plays with the toys on each petal.. Once he's tired of one he spins himself to the next.. Also to make this item even better, it is so compact.. You take it out to play with it than you can fold the mat up and take the tummy device and put it under his bed or in the closet or where ever.. It can go anywhere you go because its so easy to maneuver.. I would recommend this to everyone.."
Baby,5.0,Love Ladybugs,Bought it for my niece's baby girl who was less than a month old at the time and it has been a total success. Not only does she do her tummy time on it but it also compliments the baby's room decor that is accented with ladybugs.  Very nice product. I would have loved this Garden Gym when my girls (now 6 and 8 yrs. old) were babies!
Baby,5.0,Love It,Fisher Price did a great job with the Rainforest line.  The mobile is just one of many products that my husband and I bought for our second daughter.  She loves it and I would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.
Baby,5.0,WILL BUY THIS MOBILE OVER & OVER AGAIN,My son is now 3 months old and since he was born he has been fascinated with this mobile. He does not take his eyes off it. He finds the movement of the leaves intriguing and he is attracted to the bright colors. I highly recommend this product to anyone no matter what theme your nursery is...like I said my son loves it and it's been the best product we have bought for him.
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Mobile is Awesome,"Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile   I bought this for our house so that when my grandson comes to visit, he will have a mobile to sleep by. When my daughter brought him over, she loved it so much that I bought her one and she gave away the one she already had. There are some cool features on this mobile. For example, it has a remote control for turning it on and off. This way, you don't have to enter the room and disturb the sleeping baby. Also, it has a rainforest sound of crickets and other creatures that I find to be very relaxing (there are classical music sounds as well). It has adjustable volume controls and the leaves go up and down. You can tell it is well made and will last for years. I highly recommend this mobile."
Baby,4.0,Great - if your baby likes Tumy Time,"This is super adorable, made really well and priced well.  It is a great idea...if your baby already enjoys tummy time.  My duaghter did NOT.  I bought this hoping to help her become more comfortable with tummy time and help her learn to crawl....didn't work.  She would stay on it for about 1.3 seconds.  She has never crawled, went straight to walking by 10 months, so oh well.  I sold mine to a friend, whose kid loves it."
Baby,5.0,Great,I think this is great.  I have a bumbleride stroller and it didn't have a drink tray.  It is sturdy when it is on the stroller.
Baby,4.0,mobile,"We really like this mobile.  So does my 6 month old. There is a lot to look at and we like the choices of music/sound. One thing we wish the mobile had is a small light in the center so our son could see some of the animals a little better. But all in all, it is great!"
Baby,5.0,"Great, Practical Buy!",Just received this product and I love it. It fits perfectly on my umbrella MacLaren stroller with the separated handles.  It  was a great alternative for the other organizers including the MacLaren version. It can hold two-  real/ adult beverages along with your necessities. Great shopping pal.  - Shopping in MS
Baby,5.0,Tummy time tolerated,"My 11 week old daughter could not handle tummy time.   She would lay on her tummy for 5 mins TOPS and then WAIL!  Now when she is on the ladybug she moves herself around and has tripled her tummy time!   She did not like it much as first but we worked up to it.   She seems to do a little better JUST on the ground, too.   Her favorite part is the mirror and will spin herself around everytime to find it!  She also likes the bright yellow face of butterfly!  :)"
Baby,4.0,Couple quirks but very good mobile,"We bought this and our baby loved it, but the leaves would slow down considerably when they were going up and down, almost to stopping.  We thought it was broken so we exchanged it for a new one, and the second one did the same thing, so we just figured we had to live with it that way.  With some more use though it seems to be doing better.<br />The music is great- it calms the baby down.  He also likes the motion- keeps him from getting too restless in his crib while I read or sing to him.  You can turn the motion or the nightlight on and off, and the music can be loud, soft, or off, so you can create any combination you want (including all 3).  Some people have said it's too quiet, but I think it's the perfect volume, even with the white noise playing in our son's room, he seems to be able to hear it just fine, and the quieter setting is perfect for helping him doze off.<br />Overall a great mobile, we're very happy with it, and glad the slow motion didn't prove to be a chronic problem, as that was annoying."
Baby,1.0,Not for my child,"I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy. When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on. I was afraid it was going to tip over. It didn't look like it would suppport her. If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over. I returned it."
Baby,5.0,Great for daycare,"We own the FP bassinet that has a similar mobile and bought this one for our son's crib at daycare.  As parents, we like the idea of having some consistency at the different sleeping areas and our son loves these guys!  Also, this product is very easy to install quickly and battery life seems pretty good."
Baby,1.0,Complete and utter waste of money,"After great experiences with smaller Lamaze toys for my infant (especially the sensory cube) and after a remark by the pediatrician that my infant was a bit behind with rolling over and such due to GERD issues that limited time on her tummy or flat on her back, I bought this item.  While it's attractive, it did nothing more than what and ordinary Boppy or even a blanket on the floor would have done for her.  In fact, concentrating pressure on her torso shifted her reflux into overdrive.     What a waste of money for us.  However, the mat will make a nice wall decoration in the nursery."
Baby,3.0,A cute baby toy,"I bought this product in an effort to get my little boy on his belly more.  When I put him on it, he likes it for about 2 minutes and then freaks out.  He's a little over 4 months old and it's clearly for an older baby that can use their arms and legs better.  I hope to get some use out of this in the months to come."
Baby,5.0,Really glad to have found this,"I purchased this for a double stroller that has no drink caddy/top compartment. I was able to strap it to one side, realistically I could put two on but I don't really need two. Great product."
Baby,5.0,Worth every penny!,What a cute mobile and I just love the Fisher-Price Rainforest decor. I was a little hesitant reading that it was only recommeded to use the mobile part of the crib till the baby is 5 months old we decided to go ahead and get it (our baby was 4 months at the time). Well Noah is now 8 months old and we are still using the entire mobile on this crib. He loves watching it and I love the different selections of music and nature sounds. Also I love the fact that once the baby is older and pulling up etc. that you can just remove the mobile section and use the musical base to help soothe. You can't go wrong. I wish we had found this when he was a newborn.
Baby,5.0,This is THE BEST baby item I own,"Ok.  I rarely review products on Amazon but I just had to post my thoughts on this mobile.  My baby had a really hard time falling asleep.  I am not kidding when I say because of this mobile I can now lay her down, turn it on and it actually PUTS HER TO SLEEP.  This has de-stressed our bedtime routine immensely.  She loves it.  We do all the things we normally would but instead of her crying when I lay her down she watches and listens to this mobile contently until she falls asleep.  Also, when she wakes super early I can use the handy remote, turn it on and she coos at it for a while so i don't have to jump up right away."
Baby,5.0,Great accessory for Peg Perego Centro Completo,"I bought this to attach to a Peg Perego Centro Completo Stroller that only came with one, woefully inadequate cup holder.  The Buggy Buddy attaches easily to the stroller, and can accomodate a 24 oz water bottle, without feeling tippy.  We haven't given it the ultimate Starbucks test yet, but the cupholders look roomy enough to handle a venti.  It has a nice zippered mesh pocket for holding credit card, drivers licence, keys, etc. and a generous area between the cup holders for other necessities. We have been using it a couple of weeks, now, and so far so good.  A big thumbs up on this one!"
Baby,4.0,Great addition to my stroller,"Got this neat organizer basket for 2008 my Peg Perego Aria OH since it does not have a parent tray. I really love that I can fold my stroller with the basket still attched. It works pretty good, seems sturdy to hold all my goodies, and holds lots of stuff. There is a side zipper pocket for valuables, 2 cupholder spots which are elastic, and a main space for other things. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit many different size stroller bars. The only bad thing I can think of is that it doesn't stay perfect like the picture indicates, could be the way the Aria handles are, but it tends to slide down sometimes. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would buy it again if needed!"
Baby,4.0,Good Tool for Tummy Time,"[[ASIN:B000I2MRHE Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym]]    My daughter received this when she was 1 month-old.  A little too young, but I set her in it periodically.  She is now 4 1/2 months-old and has learned to spin herself around and will stay entertained for about 20 minutes.  I have enjoyed it.  I was not good at doing tummy time with my older daughter who did not like her tummy and needed to be entertained during tummy time."
Baby,5.0,Seals perfectly!!,"Maybe an Avent product, but it works awesomely with Gerber Gentle Flow!!! No leaks!! & great for formula mixing & storing bottles in a diaper bag :)"
Baby,5.0,EXCELLENT!!! Best Addition to our umbrella stroller.,"This was exactly what we needed for our Graco Ipo umbrella stroller. I had just purchased our new umbrella stroller for easy use through Disneyland Park but I also wanted to find something that would hold a drink. Perfect! It fit perfectly between the separated handles and held my sons sippy cup, my drink cup, as well as our camera and snacks for my son. I was able to use it with bottled water, drink cups with lids and sippy cups. It was super easy to put on, and super easy to take off and fold compactly. I had looked at other stroller cup holders but this one offered the stability to hold more than just a bottled water. The open area between drinks left it for easy access to the camera and snacks and other small junk we collected along the way. I couldn't have asked for a better little accessory to my new stroller. Also, shipping to California from NY was super fast-ordered it Thursday received it Monday. Yeah!"
Baby,5.0,Good product,"I like this product.  My daughter is just starting to use it, because she was still a little too small when I purchased it. The mirror wasn't properly attached, so I had to sew down the velcro bottom the mirror attached to.  Other than that I've had no problems and I love the bright colors.  It is very sturdy and easy to clean."
Baby,5.0,The Best Mobile!,"We just love this mobile, and baby does too.  I love how it not only spins but the leaves go up and down.  The rain forest sounds are adorable too.  It was a breeze to set up and attach to the crib.  The only two negatives about this mobile is that it has about a 10 minute timer and then it shuts off which I wish you could change or at least make it stay on a bit longer than that.  The other thing is that our baby also has a Fischer Price aquarium attached to her crib and when using the remote it turns that aquarium on and off instead of the mobile!"
Baby,5.0,AMAZING!,"What a great product! I was searching for the perfect stroller and found it (the Graco IPO). This organizer made a great product awesome. The organizer has plenty of room for everything I need to keep handy when I am out with the baby. It's sturdy and the velcro straps attach right to the back of my rear seat, so putting it away in the car (and keeping it off the floor) are easy as pie!!"
Baby,5.0,Great organizer!,"This is a great product, and fits my Maclaren Triumph perfectly.  It's great for holding keys and other small items if you don't want to take a big diaper bag with you on quick trips into stores and such.  I can also keep it on the stroller when I fold it, which is great - I don't have to keep putting it on and taking it off.  Great buy for the money!!"
Baby,2.0,"Good idea, but product could use some improvements","The mat is too small and is not rigid enough.  Unless your baby is on the small side for the recommended age range of the product, they will soon outgrow the mat.  Also, the mat is soft and doesn't stay put when in use causing for constant adjustments during play."
Baby,5.0,baby loves it,"baby absolutely is enthralled with this thing.  really glad we got it.  still using it to help her sleep at nights now.  well made, comes with a remote.  speaker could be a little louder."
Baby,1.0,not a good toy,"my kid hated tummy time so i got this.  he hates this even more.  my friends' kid, who likes tummy time hates it also."
Baby,5.0,Buggy Buddy***YES***,"Great and economomical product.  Solved our problem with our Volo Stroller.  Room for keys, sunglasses, a bottle, a few little toys and my soft drink. It was easy to install and looks like it came with the stroller.  I would recommend this product.  Seems compatable to any stroller."
Baby,3.0,Larger gym is more practical,"This gym is OK for a little while, but once your child gets to exploring (4+ months) and needs more room to roam, this Gym is useless.  It's very small, and only functions for the minimalist.  In other words, the baby will grow bored rather quickly.  If I could exchange it, I'd get the larger fisher-price baby gym with more toys on it."
Baby,4.0,Good value,"This was bought for twins.  It was easy to mount and the music is very nice.  The girl is indifferent to it but the boy loves it.  However, it  gets him excited which is really the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish.  Overall, we are pleased with this product and would recommend it."
Baby,2.0,Lamaze spinner,"I liked the piece of equipment,but the baby was a bit too old for it - 5 mos.  I'm not sure a baby younger than that would do much with the product.  Suggest they make it a bit larger, so larger babies can use.  Good to develop upper body strength."
Baby,4.0,Cute Baby Toy,"My daughter enjoys all of the Lamaze toys in this style!<br /><br />Logan the lion has small teething toys that hang from his paws and he sports a cute little mane that is colorful and entertaining.<br /><br />One thing i did not expect is that there is a small ball of some sort inside his little head that makes a sound effect similar to growling. A very cute surprise, although it made my daughter a little wary at first.<br /><br />Overall a great little toy. We use ours to hang on her car seat and it keeps her busy for the parts of the ride she doesn't sleep through! =)<br /><br />I'd recommend it for any baby!"
Baby,5.0,Lamaze Eddie the Elephant Tunes,I bought 1 for a gift and saw how the baby loved it.  I bought another one for my first grandchild.  This is a developmental baby toy that the child can play with for several months!  Has so many different ways to pay tunes.  We just love it & highly recommend it to anyone!!
Baby,2.0,velcro wears easily,"I bought this mat as I thought it would be good for my daughter to grow with.  The velcro butterflies and toucan seemed like a good idea at first, but now that she's had it for about a month the velcro has worn and the butterflies don't stick for very long.  She still likes the musical tiger, but the butterflies were what held her interest and now she can pull them off immediately.  She's 4 months old and I bought it when she was a little over 3 months old.  I think it's worth it to spend a little more and get a bigger play mat without velcro as it will last longer.  She loves to play on the Tiny Love activity mat that our babysitter has."
Baby,5.0,wonderful,"I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  It is great to put your keys and cell phone is the zipper part and kids food and other stuff.  Really, really like it.  I reccomend this product."
Baby,1.0,My daughter didn't enjoy this!,"My daughter has had trouble with her \\""tummy time\\"" since day one.  She always cries whenever I try to put her on her tummy.  I thought that if I could make it fun for her, that she might begin to enjoy herself.  I received this product, and from her first try until her 10th try she absolutely hated it.  She kept reaching down and grabbing at the mat, this prevented her from using her hands to push herself around in a circle.  I think that laying on that swivel hurt her stomach, too.  I gave it away just a couple weeks after receiving it.  It didn't work for my daughter, but it might work for someone else's."
Baby,4.0,Good for Price and Size,"My baby loves playing on this mat, obviously he has nothing else to compare to, so he doesn't know what he is missing from the larger dome style playmats.  I bought this for the size and portability.  Downside, not enough toys and long enough music for him to play and hear.  I attach more toys to the bar for him to play and also bought a kick activated musical board.  Overall a good buy for the size."
Baby,5.0,"A perfect size for care package, nice product","This would be a perfect little animal to put inside your son or daughter's care package. It is bright in color and has lots of things to feel, different textures to touch. Great for little ones who might now had enough tactile stimulation. If you send with your care package, expect not to get it back, if you don't know that other children will get use out of this toy.     Lamaze also has a Panda called Patty the Panda and a lioness called Tina the Tiger. Which ever toy you send buy 2 one for baby and one for the orphanage."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"This organizer is perfect! It fits my Maclaren stroller and can be moved over to my jogging stroller, if need be. It fits a cell phone, car keys, crackers, a sippy cup and a venti latte, no problem. I don't even have to take it off when I collapse my stroller. Good quality, simple and works great!"
Baby,4.0,Great!,"I ordered this to go along with my Graco IPO which does not have a parent basket. This works great. Not to big, not to small, folds with the stroller so I dont have to worry about taking it off when the stroller is not in use. Gret buy, great price."
Baby,4.0,"Elephant toy, just ok","I bought this toy because my daughter has the Fisher Price laugh and learn puppy and she loves it, so I wanted to get her another, similar toy as a back-up. The buttons on the snout are too small for her to press to make noise, but when I push the buttons she really likes it. It will be better when she's older, but for now it's just another stuffed animal."
Baby,4.0,Adriana is happy with her Musical Mobile!!!,"This Musical Mobile has been an excellent choice for my baby. She really enjoys it: sounds, lights and movement!!! Music selection is wonderful, however, volume should be a improved to a little more higher than the one it is sold nowadays"
Baby,3.0,"good, not great",My granddaughter likes this all right. But she's more of a touch it/sound effect person and the ball on the cat is tough to get sound out of with tiny 2 1/2 month hands. She loves the bouncer that the slightest kick or hit will activate the sounds.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"This is sturdy, easy to use, easy to find things in (versus the hanging stroller bags).  Buy it - you won't regret it!"
Baby,4.0,fits my needs,"I just needed a cup holder for my umbrella stroller.  This has two cup holders on it that are firm and hold my drinks well.  I put water bottles and starbucks cups in them and all fit well.  I like the zipper pouch to hold my keys, though I wish the zippered area was a bit bigger to fit my wallet in."
Baby,4.0,Great Drink Holder,"I really like this, for holding my drinks and a few essentials, I combined it with a mesh bag to a hang off of my European Stroller that does not have any storage for Mom or Dad. The mesh bag also has cup holders, but I do not trust them. This one is nice and sturdy and works well, even on cobblestone roads that we walk often here in Germany. The storage area in between the cup holders is small, not enough for all the stuff I seem to carry with me, enough for some keys and mabye a small wallets, but like I said, it is easily combinable with another storage bag. And it does fit a Venti Starbucks cup. Great products."
Baby,4.0,smaller than i imagined....,this is a nice product for a baby... but a little small. my baby scoops the mat into her mouth rather than playing with the toys because the mat doesnt reach too far out for her to really notice the toys. especially when shes trying to turn the thing around. the mat can become tangled and i have to constantly straighten it. but you can also use the ladybug by itself. ive done that too. :)
Baby,3.0,Excellent quality but a little bit dull.,The quality of this mobile is great. The motor is quite the music sound is excellent it fitted well on our crib although its a new excotic design. Also the remote is a GREAT feature.  However the classical music was kind of dull and the peeka boo leaves doesn't really hide the dragon fly which makes them more of a clutter than a peek-a-boo. In general the mobile is so cluttered that we felt our baby wasn't able to follow the movement of any particular part and was not intrested in it.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money...,"We bought this even after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I sure wish i would have listened to the reviews instead of wasting my time and money. Like the other reviews stated, the music is very low, hard to hear unless you have a completly silent house (and who does), the light is very dim, to dim to even see the mobile in a dark room in the middle of the night, so what enjoyment does the baby get if they can't even see it. And the remote doesn't even work very well, in the middle of the night you have to activate the mobile manually first before the remote will work, doesnt that defeat the purpose of having the remote in the middle of the night. I will be returning it and getting something different."
Baby,5.0,Tons of fun!,My 9-month-old grandson loves this toy.  We sing all the songs and make up our own songs as well.  This is a very musical toy and we have hours of fun with it.  It also records the songs/tunes we make up and plays them back to us.
Baby,4.0,Very nice,This product is wonderful...but I have a complaint . The product was packed in a box 3 times its size and I feel it could have been less bulky. The product was sent from its delivery address untouched and it cost a whole lot to deliver.
Baby,3.0,Not bad...,"This product was pretty good, and seemed to serve the purpose for which it was intended.  However, it was a little smaller than I expected (perhaps a picture with a baby on it would be helpful to gauge size), and my baby didn't react to it any differently than he would have to tummy time on the floor directly, i.e. he screamed to get up after about two minutes!  The cute distraction items (the bee, birds, butterflies, etc.) didn't seem to take his mind off the fact that it was tummy time nonetheless, so it was a bit of a wasted product for me."
Baby,4.0,perfect for our stroller!!,"it can hold a large coffee cup or a large drink bottle on each cup holder. has a plenty of room for keys, cell phone and more..   The best of all... i can fold the stroller with buggy buddy organizer attached to it. worth evey penny!!!"
Baby,4.0,Used only once,I just got this product and I have used it only once. As a matter of fact I am able to write this and eat at the same time while my 2 month old is entertained by this product.
Baby,5.0,Excellent Mobile,"I registered for this mobile to attach to my daughter's crib.  I didn't use it for a while but have started to recently.  Every morning when she wakes up and when she wakes up from her naps, I find her happy and smiling in her crib staring up at the animals hanging from the mobile.  She loves them!  Now that she is alert and aware of her surroundings, she can see them and keep herself entertained and happy.  Instead of being notified that she is awake by hearing crying, I hear happy noises which makes getting her up from her crib a wonderful experience.    At nighttime, I have recently started putting her down when she is sleepy but awake and fussy.  I turn the mobile on with the Bach music setting and she lays there listening and watching until she falls asleep on her own.  I have successfully gotten her to fall asleep at naptime this way with just playing the music.  The movement seems to keep her up during the day.    The remote seems like a great idea but I have not had to use it yet.  I just wish they made a travel mobile!"
Baby,4.0,Great for the early morning,"My son loves this mobile, in the early morning after his first bottle I place him back in his crib and it helps him back to sleep. It's great when he doesn't want to be held, he just watches the slow moving leaves and he favorte animal the monkey move along."
Baby,4.0,Good Mobile,"My four month old does enjoy watching this mobile in her crib and it will quietly entertain her and sometimes even put her to sleep.  The music is not very loud, but since it's soothing that seems ok to me.  We used rechargeable batteries with it and they did seem to run down quickly, but they always run down faster than regular batteries.  It was easy to install on the crib and seems stable."
Baby,2.0,Rainforest Giraffe?,Very nice product. I like the colors and style but since when do you have giraffes in the rainforest?  Not very educational for your kid ehh....
Baby,5.0,Good seal,"Fits all avent toxic plastic bottles and the non toxic sportster/magic cups. Does not fit VIA, one of the 2 non toxic plastic bottles avent has."
Baby,5.0,Great Addition to my stroller!,"I bought this as an additional holder for my Graco Duo Glider stroller and just love it.  It holds quite a bit and doesn't need to be detached to close the stroller. As a matter of fact, I am buying another one for my single stroller since it is working out so well.  You can't beat the price either.  I also think this could be used on my kids bikes once they get older so it is nice to see more bang for my buck!  Great product."
Baby,3.0,Good idea but my baby hates it,"I can see where this could be a good thing.  My daughter is 6 months old and has had this for probably 3 months.  She was too little when I got it.  I try it again every couple of weeks.  She is now almost 14 pounds and is 25 inches long.  She just doesn't fit comfortably in it.  I think if the ladybug was a little softer, she may like it more...it just seems to hard for her to lay on.  I wouldn't spend $40 on it.  There are lots of other tummy time toys out there that seem to be better."
Baby,5.0,My grandson loves this,I purchased this for the crib at my house for my grandson.  He loves it.  He watches the animals go round and the leaves go up and down and just smiles.  I love the different sounds that you can play on it.  I would highly recommend it.
Baby,4.0,Great,My girls love the play mat and love to move around the mat with their hands. Great concept
Baby,3.0,baby gift,"The deliver speed is good but over packing. Online store need to think a green and environmental friendly for shipping.     My friend love the little gym. After baby grow out of it, it can be use for lazy Susan for dinning table."
Baby,5.0,This is very cute,My son loves this little lion.  He has lots of different things going with his rattles and rings along with crinkly feet and ribbon mane.  Lamaze products are always a good bet and this one doesn't disappoint.
Baby,5.0,Fantastic,"I went in search of a battery powered mobile after getting tired of going to my 4 month old's nursery every 3 minutes when our cute Graco wind-up mobile wold stop. I told my wife that there had to be a battery powered option in this day and age!!! Anyhow, I saw the glowing reviews on Amazon and picked this up. Wish I would have done it sooner! Remote control, runs smoothly and the baby loves it!!!"
Baby,5.0,Holds a lot!,"I love this holder.  I use it with my Mountain Buggy Breeze every day as I take public transportation in Germany.  I can fit a water bottle, sippy, 1 diaper, travel wipes pack, my keys(in the mesh zipper pocket) and my wallet.  It is a God send!"
Baby,2.0,Nice concept but didnt use much,I loved the idea when i saw it. Bought it for Christmas last year and my son used it about 5 times it was awkward for him being in that position for more than a minute. so maybe your child will love it but mine didnt.
Baby,5.0,She LOVES it!,"I had a late shower (5 weeks old) and received this as a gift. She has loved it from the get-go. She was entranced by the music at first, then learned eventually how to make it go on her own. She learned to pull the butterflies off the velcro. She chews on most of the things, but that's what babies do. The only pointless part I think is the pillow. I'm not a huge fan of the way the ball and mirror and all that work (and the little flap is pretty pointless too), but she was never very interested in those anyway, so for us, those don't go into the score (or it I guess it would have been a 3 or 4). Overall, we are very pleased, and at 6 months, she still enjoys it."
Baby,5.0,Great little organizer,"I purchased this organizer to go onto my little Combi stroller.  It is basically an umbrella stroller that folds in thirds into itself.  I bought this thinking that I'd have to take it on and off everytime that I used it, but that would be okay because I wanted something that would hold it's shape better than a hanging bag with a drink pouch.  I was pleasantly surprised that I don't have to remove it, it bends just enough to fold with the stroller, but is still firm enough to hold my pop without swinging and splashing.  Very important for a Cherry Pepsi-aholic!  It also holds keys, cell, pacifier, and sippy cup just perfect!  It's great!"
Baby,2.0,Depends on the baby,"The usefulness of this product really depends on the baby.  My daughter HATED tummy time and this product made no difference.  I wouldn't pay full price for this again without trying it out first.  It's a great concept, but doesn't hold up in reality.  And it would only be useful for a month or two.  Maybe the mat would be fun later without the lady bug in the middle..."
Baby,2.0,Not interested,I bought this for my daughter and she never liked it.  She hated the base that you rest on.  She did like the mat with all the various sounds.  I wouldn't suggest this for anyone.
Baby,4.0,A good buy.,"My 6 month old loves this mat. He lies on his back and bats at the toy bar, and kicks the tree with his feet. He also loves the music.     My only real complaint is how small the mat is - he is a big boy and doesn't really have room to roll over without running into the side bars."
Baby,4.0,Not what I expected,"It works well but not really what I expected. When I saw Peek-a-boo I really taught that the animals were hidden an showed back. It is just the leaves opening and closing. But it has great color and my son like it so...I like it, after all, it is for him."
Baby,5.0,Phillips Sealing Discs,"Glad I ordered these. Perfect Purchase! It seemed like they took a while to arrive, but very happy with purchase."
Baby,5.0,My baby LOVES this toy,"I got this toy for my son when he was about 10 wks old and discovering his hands... I thought the big eyes would be appealing and he could learn to grab onto the rings. He loves it so much, it really helped him build his hand-eye coordination by grabbing the rings, and he just loves to stare at the lion. It makes the coolest \\""purring\\"" sound when you move it too, he loves that as well. Highly recommended!"
Baby,5.0,Great Product,The Buggy Budy arrived very quickly and in perfect condition!  Great product for the price.
Baby,3.0,Just okay,"It is a neat idea, but I don't think it is worth the price. Unless you find it on sale, it's not worth the money. It's just a piece of fabric with animals on it. You could make the same thing for much cheaper. Like I said, it is a cool toy, but for what you get, it's overpriced."
Baby,5.0,Great Product!,"My daughter loves this mobile.  The music is very soft and soothing, and the night light isn't too bright.  We have a convertible crib, and it fits well.  I would definitely recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Good mobile,My son loves this!  The bright colors catch his attention and help him sleep.  Recommended
Baby,1.0,Blah,We got this as a gift but I am not impressed. We also have the Tiny Love Gymini and that is way better for only a little more money.     This FP gym is small. It is a pain to put together. It feels a little cheap and the toys aren't as soft or as well made as the Tiny Love.    My kid wasn't interested in it at all compared to the Tiny Love. Also the Tiny Love pops open easily and stores really easily.
Baby,5.0,We love this mobile!,"We have twin girls and wanted something for them look at while they were falling asleep. We read the other reviews about this mobile and bought it, and we love it! They LOVE watching the animals go around and the leaves going up and down. We usually use the rainforest noises which are very gentle, while we play lullabys on our iPod. The classical music is really nice, too. The best thing is that it plays for a long time. I've heard other people say their mobiles only go for a few minutes. We never use the light feature, but maybe when they get older and we take off the mobile part the light will come in handy.    The girls were in separate bassinets in our bedroom and there was no way to attach this, so we (eek!) attached it to a dining room chair and put it between them. It worked out great and we could move it to our living room for when they were in their Pack n Play. Now they're sharing a crib and the mobile fits great. Our the crib bars are round and decorative, so it doesn't fit as well as it would if they were square, but it's still sturdy and I'm not worried about it at all. The first time our daughter saw it from directly underneath, she started laughing! I'm online today to buy a second one so they can both lie centered under their own mobiles, instead of watching from the sides!"
Baby,5.0,Grandsons Gifts,"I purchased the Lamaze Eddie the elephant for my grandsons they were so fascinated by the colors, textures and flexability of the toy.  I loved it myself."
Baby,5.0,My grandaughter loves it!,I got this mobile as a Christmas present for my grandaughter who loves to be carried.  She loves the music & watching the leaves move & most importantly it allows mom & dad to have a break to do chores without her crying to be picked up.  I also love that when she outgrows the mobile it turns into a night light.
Baby,1.0,Waste of Money,"This toy could possibly interest an infant.  Having said that, my daughter is 17th months and did not look twice.  His trunk plays a single note with every shape pushed... big deal.  I tried to interest her in the recording option, but she was not interested in hearing a bunch of random notes played back to her.    For $[...] this is a complete waste of money."
Baby,5.0,Simply wonderful,"Love, love, love this mobile. I just got my new Rainforest mobile in the mail today and immediately put it together and set it up for my 2 month old son. He loves it! I had to get a new mobile because the one I bought to match my crib set was a pain to wind up every couple minutes... So I searched for something that played on it's own.<br /><br />I was deciding between this mobile and the \\""Tiny Love\\"" mobiles but ultimately went with this one because it had a light, remote, a longer timer, is battery operated, and cheaper! I also read the reviews of both and I agree that the speed on this one is just perfect, as is the music, sounds, and the volume. I also read on reviews for the \\""Tiny Love\\"" mobile that people had problems with it falling on their baby, but the Rainforest mobile seems to be very strong and sturdy and I made sure to put it together exactly like the directions tell you to.<br /><br />I also think the animals and moving leafs are so adorable. Great choice for me! And my baby loves it as much as I do!"
Baby,3.0,It's alright.,this stroller caddy is okay. the velcro straps are in odd places for strollers with a one-piece handlebar.
Baby,5.0,Finally I can have my Starbucks and Maclaren too,This works well on my Maclaren Triumph with a Venti coffee or my Kleen Kanteen. I am soooo happy!  I just make sure to unfold the stroller canopy just in case of any stray splatters but so far all the liquid stays in the cup.  I wish it could fold with the stroller.  I have left it in the trunk a few times forgetting its not attached to the stroller.  The metal frame is what keeps it so stable though so I'll just deal with it.
Baby,5.0,This is Wonderful!,"We bought this for our soon to be 4 month old daughter before she was born. This was money well spent. It is loud enough for her to hear, but not too loud that it keeps her awake. The Rainforest sounds are very soothing. I also like the little remote that comes with it so we can restart it if need be w/out going over to her crib and disturbing her. (once she sees us it's game over and she wants held) I strongly recommend this product."
Baby,4.0,Quality bow and arrow toy,"Our 4-year-old boy quickly learned how to position the arrow and hold it in place while pulling the cord back. So far (3 weeks of using it) it's durable and the wooden parts seem like quality work. It does not sucction onto the surface as I sought it would (closer distance helps). My son is better than I to have it stick to the surface and to the target. So, I think it's a matter of technique and skill rather than the matter of the bow/arrow how accurately it works."
Baby,5.0,BEST STROLLER CUPHOLDER!,"I use it on my baby jogger city mini (single).  It fits PERFECT!  Can even fold my stroller with it on.  Fits sippy cups, water bottles, coffee, keys, phone etc etc.  Fits a surprisingly a lot, and it's so cheap!!!  Love it- perfect for walks and the mall :)"
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"I have a set of twins, they both LOVE this mobile.  They'll lay there and coo and giggle while it plays.  I highly recommend this item."
Baby,5.0,My son LOVES this thing!,"I'm usually not into trendy or popular items, but this mobile is popular for a reason - kids LOVE it!  My son LOVES this mobile.  When he's crying and screaming we put him under the mobile and his cries turn to laughs and giggles!  My son examines every animal as it moves arounds and coos and smiles at all the animals.  I bought this mobile because the animals face down (seriously, I don't understand why the animals face OUT in a lot of other mobiles) and for the primary colors.  I never thought that the music was too quiet -- as a matter of fact, I keep the volume turned down -- he's only a few inches away from the mobile, I don't need to blast out his ear drums!"
Baby,5.0,One of the Best Mobiles on the Market!!  Highly Recommend,"We needed a mobile for our 3 month old son's playard in the living room.  We looked at several mobiles, but many weren't colorful or captivated his attention for a long period of time.  Also, we found that it was difficult to attach several mobiles to the crib and playard.  With the Fisher Price mobile, we were able to attach it to the stairwell and also a chair with spindles in it.  Out of all the other mobiles we saw, we highly recommend this one.  Its a plus to also have the remote.  I used this remote on many occasions when I was home alone and breastpumping.  We also loved the different choices in music."
Baby,5.0,Buggy Buddy,It's great to have someplace to put my coffee.  Holds my venti coffee and a sippy cup or juice box.
Baby,3.0,"not exactly what I expected, but functions","This case is very bulky. Seems to be durable material, and I like that it has a strap, something I have not seen in other cases. However, the red dot that slides for \\""easy\\"" access is not so easy. I'd call it sticky access.   Other than the hanging strap, there is NO reason to buy this. I recently found a slimmer design at BabiesRUS that is made by Huggies and has a flap in the center to access wipes. This Skip Hop case opens to one side and is hard to grab the wipes out.     I would like to edit my review to be only one star. After one week inside the case, my wipes were dried out. This is not acceptable."
Baby,2.0,good while it lasted,"this mobile mesmerized my son..until the motor broke and it stopped working after a month...I'd pick a more expensive model if you want one that works well, i would however recommend the rainforest soother!"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile!,I had gotten another mobile as a gift and the toys fell off and hit my son in his face. I returned and bought this one instead! The music is really nice. The quality is good and my son loves it! I didn't think there would be such a drastic differene in quality from one to another but there really was.
Baby,2.0,Not that great,"My son hated this. He cried most times I put him on it. It is great quality and the mat has great sensory items, but the ladybug was anoying and not fun for my son."
Baby,4.0,We like it - baby likes it!,"Surprised that the reviews aren't a little higher overall for this product, but I guess as always, different things appeal to different kids and parents. Our 3-month old has had this gym for a few weeks and she really enjoys her time on/in it. We have it set up so she can kick at the swinging tiger and the tunes it plays are quite cute and not annoying - a real plus. The little 'pillow' head rest thingy is pointless, but other than that we're very pleased with this purchase. Are there really tigers and giraffes in rainforests? I guess I won't let that bug me too much ..."
Baby,5.0,WE LOVE iT!!!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!,"I started my wild goose hunt for the perfect mobile for my 2 month old daughter and all I saw was these pastel, \\""just for looks\\"" mobiles that wind up and play one song. Most of them were too pricey for just a \\""cute\\"" mobile. But we wanted to find one with bright, bold colors that would grab her attention. When I saw this one I knew that this one was it. Yes it is kinda pricey, but keep in mind that all mobiles are around $20 or $30. When it arrived in the mail, I instantly hooked it up and put her in her crib. It started to move up and down and all around, and she smiled the biggest smile that we have ever seen. She started cooing and \\""talking\\"" to it, and thats when we knew that it was WELL WORTH IT!!! If you are thinking about buying this for your little one then I strongly recommend it. Your child will love it...wait and see!       BTW---check out the 2 pictures that we posted of our little girl in her pink room..."
Baby,4.0,Cute Mobile with Variety,"When I was searching for a mobile for my daughter's crib, I wanted something that would be gender generic and cute.  This mobile provides adorable rainforest animals that actually face down so my daughter does not have to simply look at animal bottoms.  The music is a nice variety, and the little glow from the picture on the base is pleasant.  The remote to turn on and off the mobile seems like a nice convenience, but I haven't used it except to test it."
Baby,3.0,Nice but stopped working properly,"Overall, this is a very nice mobile; however, it stopped working properly after just a couple months. Because of that fact, I would not recommend it.    Pluses  - My son quite likes it -- not as much as the Haba Flutterbys mobile, but well enough. He was about two months when we got it and is five months now.   - The animals are bright and engaging.  - The rainforest sound is very pleasant.    Minuses  - Stopped working properly after maybe two months. It gets stuck and makes a grinding sound until I give it a push (defeating the purpose of having the mobile - to entertain my son for a few minutes so I can do something else). It is not the batteries.  - The classical music setting are pretty tinny - but my son still seems to like them OK."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"My son loves this mobile.  It is very cute and has great music.  I noticed that some people complained about it being too quiet to hear, but it seems perfect to me.  If you are like me and notice that a lot of children's toys are really loud, then you'll think this mobile is perfect because for once, someone took into consideration how children hear.  I think sometimes parents don't realize that many adults don't hear as well as they did when they were younger.  In addition, the speaker is such that it directs the sound down towards the child."
Baby,5.0,Just what I needed.,"I have a Phil & Ted's Sport which is just about the best stroller I can imagine (and has a great big cargo bin under the seats) but it's a little scant on handy storage. Their hangbag was expensive and not well-rated, so I decided to try this instead. I am very pleased with it. The velcro straps make it very adjustable, with a snug fit even on my slanted handlebar. It barely swings at all and it does keep drinks upright. It has just enough room for my wallet, cell phone, and keys between the two cupholders. I like the zippered mesh pocket inside too, because my 18-month-old daughter hasn't figured out how to open it and I can leave a chapstick and pack of mints in there. Not crazy about the big logo on the front, but at least it's embroidered rather than screen-printed. Recommended."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful Mobile!!!,"My son loved this mobile.  Not only does it play nice music, but it is so neat the that the leaves fan up and down slowly while the little rainforest animals spin slowly.  So soothing....my son just loved this.  He also had the rainforest waterfall soother which he was able to use much longer (we had to take the mobile down when he started standing on his own and trying to grab the little animals), but that will happen with all mobiles.  He has also used the rainforest waterfall peek-a-boo soother from one month until present (he is currently 15 months old). I think that both crib products also compliment each other nicely.  I would not buy a mobile just because it compliments the room...most are too plain and not eye-catching enough for babies....definately highly consider buying this mobile...it has been so wonderful for my son.  It also comes with a remote so that it can be turned on and off from another room, although I don't think we ever used the remote much."
Baby,1.0,"Terrific, even though we had to modify it...","I gave this product one-star mostly to get your attention.  This product is wonderful, but only if you modify it by taking out the large flapping leaves.<br /><br />Our first Rainforest Mobile lasted about 3 months before it stopped spinning/flapping.  The songs still played, so I knew the batteries were okay (even replaced the batteries and the status remained the same).  I called Fisher Price and had it replaced by the warranty.  Fisher Price customer service was very kind and helpful, and I received the replacement within the 6-8 weeks they said it would take.<br /><br />However, upon receiving the new mobile, I installed it with flapping leaves in place, and noticed that after only a few weeks the flapping leaves were slowing down, and mobile seemed to be struggling.<br /><br />I took out the flapping leaves, and left the smaller leaves with bird/monkey/frog intact and the mobile now runs with no problems.  We've had the newer mobile for 13 months, and have not needed to replace the batteries or call for help in all this time.  We use it daily to put our 18-month old boy to sleep at night.<br /><br />We do recommend this mobile, but only if used without the large flapping leaves that drain the motor."
Baby,5.0,Jon's bow and arrow review,"Not fancy but a good honest product that looks exactly like the picture. The arrows have no feathers, but they don't really need them. This works like a real bow by using the resiliency of the bow to fire the arrow. The string is not elastic. The arrows fly approximately 25 to 30 feet."
Baby,5.0,This is great!,"My daughter loves it.  I bought it for her crib at day care, along with the musical rainforest soother that goes with this set.  Other babies look at it too.  It is just great!"
Baby,5.0,Great and very convenient,This wipes case is really great. I love the quick slide button and the fact it can be hung on the stroller. With a toddler i need to get to the wipes fast! Its easy to refill too.
Baby,5.0,mom of five,"This is an awesome product. My baby loved it from the start. We bought it when he was 2 months & it was very difficult to get him to sleep. He took to it right away. He's 4 months now and loves it more than ever. The music is soft and has the perfect volume for him to fall asleep to. The light is just bright enough to light the mobile up so he can see it spin in the dark. It was definitely worth the money. If something happened to this one, I would buy the same one again."
Baby,4.0,Loves kitty,"We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old.  He absolutely loved it.  Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee.  He is now 4 1/2 months old and he still likes it, but he does seem to get bored with it quicker and he likes his larger play mat better."
Baby,5.0,Really nice mobile.,"I bought this mobile based upon the reviews others have left. I have to agree that it is a very nice mobile.  It was easy to put together and runs a long time on the batteries. However, I don't use it to put my little guy to sleep. I use it as an entertainment diversion so I can take a shower or spend a few minutes doing stuff around the house.  It keeps him fully engaged the whole 15-20 minutes that I am busy.  The only drawback is the music - I wish the music choices were a little better.  I like the volume setting of high and low and the remote control."
Baby,5.0,Good product,Easy to use. Nice addition to stroller for drinks and extra items you want easy access to.
Baby,4.0,Great for a Preemie,"This was our first infant play mat/gym.  My son was premature and, thus, had a longer \\""newborn\\"" period than most babies.  The other gym we own was too complex for him at first.  This gym was great in his newborn months but he did outgrow it fairly quickly.  He absolutely loved the hanging butterflies, which we also attached to the velcro on his Graco papasan.  We were able to use for tummy time and on his back.  This gym is great as a \\""starter\\"" but, as some previous reviews noted, won't last beyond the time they can roll over.  I would buy and use it with a second baby, though.  The size was great for not cluttering up a room and for bringing on travel."
Baby,5.0,love the avent products so far,"I've only used avent products so far and love them all.  Am using the Isis pump, 4 oz and 9 oz bottles with nipples and sealing discs.  I love that all of the products work with each other and are interchangeable on the same bottles.  I love that I can pump into the bottles, refrigerate or freeze directly and then heat and serve to my baby all without any pouring.  It's made everything very convenient for me.  I've read some reviews about leaks, but I've never had any of the bottles leak and we've boiled, heated, washed, etc. all of them multiple times now."
Baby,3.0,"cute product, isn't all that effective for us - yet","this is a really nice looking product but my son isn't enjoying it as much as i would have hoped... he still doesn't like tummy time. it is getting better though and he does spin around easily and does enjoy (for a few minutes anyhow) the toys on the mat. just a warning - when we first used it, i guess he wasn't positioned on the ladybuy properly, and he slid off head first onto the mat. he didn't cry or get hurt, but just a warning!"
Baby,5.0,Fits my Needs,"I bought this to attach to an umbrella stroller. Very easy to attach and remove. Cup holders stretch to accomodate several cup sizes. Zipper in pouch is great for holding keys, cell phone, etc."
Baby,3.0,Cute Mobile-remote is pretty useless-needs a better light show,"Our 5 month old baby loves the bright colors and soft music of this mobile.  It is engaging and fun but the lights are pretty dim and it doesn't have a light show like some others.  Also, we have not been able to get our remote for the mobile to work unless we stand a foot away and point it directly at the mobile.  Remote needs to be more sensitive. We do wish we had purchased a mobile sooner as it buys us 10-15 minutes to take a shower while she plays in her crib!"
Baby,5.0,Invaluable,"Our daughter relies on this mobile to fall asleep every night and at each nap time. Even when she's fussy and fighting sleep, the mobile almost always draws her in even when I expect her to know better than to fall for its mesmerizing powers. And when she's playful and awake, she happily watches it, kicking her legs, until she burns off her excess energy and dozes off. It's almost like a friend to her, comforting her when she's left alone to sleep.<br /><br />This past weekend we were away from home and were without the mobile for one of the first times in her life (she's 7 mos.). It took hours to get her to sleep, despite being obviously exhausted and despite having a different soothing toy there with her. It was so obvious she was looking for it whenever we tried to lay her down. The night we got home, she was overtired but seemed so relieved to be reunited with her mobile. She dozed off without a peep. I guess the only downside is that obviously she might be too reliant on it, but if it means having a baby go down easily on a regular basis, I'm okay with that."
Baby,5.0,flexibility,"I have used this buggy buddy with a standard stroller (2 separate handles)and a jogging stroller (full bar). The flexible material inside allows you to use it for a variety of necessities and provides lots of space. It is quite deep and holds my water bottle and another cup/ bottle as well as keys etc without fear of it tipping over. Some caddies i have seen are soft around the edges and not as structured as this one and they often have a fixed size for water bottles/ cups. The elastic at the top of the cup holder allows any size (within reason), holds the cup snugly and can be pushed out of the way for other items when not in use. It has been great so far."
Baby,5.0,Excellent soother,"I bought this for my 4 months old and she loves the peek-a-boo action and the music. Whenever she is cranky, I lay her in the crib and switch this on and then she is all happy. Great product for new Moms out there."
Baby,3.0,Looks good... but music is disappointing,"I loved the fact it attached so easily and perfectly to our crib (Munire urban).  Also like the way it looks.  The music is pretty terrible though. At least you can turn it down though.  My son does love to watch the leaves though, so I do not regret buying it."
Baby,2.0,Lame product,"This thing is nothing to get excited about.  It's bulkier than it needs to be, and the slider fell off of mine and got lost immediately.  You can buy one almost just like it from Huggies full of wipes for about $3."
Baby,2.0,"If my baby didn't automatically love it, I would return it","I received this product today.  It was a bit tedious to assemble (took me about 20 minutes) and is too heavy for the location I had originally hoped to put it in.  I was unable to attach it to the back rail on my crib and had to instead put it on a lower side rail, which is fine until my infant gets to be a little more mobile, and then I will either have to lower the mattress to keep it out of his reach or remove it.    I would have packed it up and returned it all together, but when I put the baby in the crib to \\""show it to him\\"", he cooed, watched the animals, and fell right asleep.  Since it was such a pain to put together I will probably keep it and just sell it when he gets too big for it to work."
Baby,4.0,"Great product, Great price","This works great with my Peg Perego Aria Oh stroller.  The cup holder that came with the stroller is flimsy and unusable.  And, there is no place to put your keys, etc.    This Buggy Buddy fits great, and holds drinks steady.  Easily holds a fountain soda, and any of the hot/cold drinks from Starbucks.  I usually do the Grande size, and they fit fine.  Don't have to worry about them spilling onto my son!    The pocket is a good size, and holds my phone, keys, wallet, easily.  Also a zippered pocket, which I don't use much, but could be useful.    I am also able to leave the Buggy Buddy on when I fold up the stroller, which makes it even more convenient.    Overall, a great and much-needed addition to my stroller.  I had seen ones that were more expensive, but purchased this based on other reviews here on Amazon.  Definitely not disappointed."
Baby,3.0,Ok cupholder,Better than nothing - ok for a sippy cup or water bottle but it doesn't hold any other kind of adult cup with a lid or straw.  I use it to hold my camera more than anything.
Baby,4.0,Perfect on my Phil & Ted's Stroller,"After reading bad reviews of the Phil & Teds cup holder accessories, I decided to try this generic one.  I was worried that the velcro wouldn't be sturdy enough, but it fits perfectly on the stroller handle, hangs securely and holds two drinks and my cell phone/keys in the middle.  I don't know that I'd cruise along with hot coffee, but for a bottle of water it does the trick.  I have a Phil & Ted's Classic stroller."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves mobile,I purchased this mobile for my new grandbaby and she LOVES it!  It holds her attention and is very attractive.
Baby,2.0,I wouldn't buy this again.,"Don't buy this gym! Get a bigger one!     We have a small house so I thought the smaller gym would be a good idea, but I really regret it. The pieces don't fit together quite right and things hang a little crooked, and it was hard to put together. The toys are not very fun or educational. Last, the narrow width is really bad - once your baby gets excited in the gym and tries to roll over, they can't - they will be prevented by the narrowness and the toy bar. One one of the larger square gyms, rolling over would be no problem, and rolling over is such an important skill. I feel like another gym would have offered a lot more possibilities and growth! I would NOT buy this one again. While I am glad there is a low-priced option for people who really can't afford a larger gym, don't buy this gym if you can possibly afford a bigger one!"
Baby,4.0,Still works after 2 years...,"My baby loves it. The music it actually plays does not go with the composer, but my kid won't know the difference. It's still working even with all the hand wacking it gets. I wish that they would make it so that it wouldn't mess up my wooden crib. Maybe like a soft material other than plastic that would protect the crib from getting all scratched up."
Baby,5.0,Great tummy time product,I bought this as a christmas gift for my daughters daycare center. My daughter has now out grown it but the younger kids still love it. It keeps them up off the floor so they can see all the little toys. It's really great product.
Baby,5.0,my baby's favorite toy,"we have a collection of lamaze toys, but my daughter likes this one the best.  it's easy to grasp and hangs pretty low."
Baby,5.0,Great product,"This is perfect for my stroller. I have an UPPA baby Vista stroller which does not come with this type of accessory. But this fits so well around the handle and is very sturdy. I fit everything I need in there for the day, keys, wallet, 2 bottles of water, burp cloth etc. Highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,Great!,"I bought this for our Simmons stroller.  It worked out great, and fits well.  Very handy!"
Baby,5.0,Very good product,This product is so useful for my combi stroller.  I'm getting my 2nd one now since we have 2 strollers.  It works very well holding some small items as long as drinks.
Baby,5.0,Fits our Peg Perego Pliko Perfectly!,"I purchased this recently in preparation for our trip to Disney.  Our Peg Perego is a great stroller, but the cup holder stinks.  It pops off and gets caught on things.  So, after looking at several options, I finally bought this stroller cup holder on Amazon.  It is great.  It fits our stroller perfectly.  We used it during our whole trip to Disney and my husband told me several times how glad he was that I had bought it.  We kept drinks for both of us in it (and they never tipped) and also my daughter's juice box in the large center compartment.  You can put snacks in there, keys, your phone, all sorts of stuff.  Also, you don't have to take it off when you close up your stroller; it just folds up and stays put.  I never had a problem with it trying to come off or not being supportive of the weight of our stuff.  Highly recommend it!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent Accessory for Stroller,"This drink/gear holder is the best deal out there.  It straps on and off easily with velcro.  I leave it attached on one side for easy folding of stroller.  It comfortably holds 2 drinks of infinite size.  Has a tiny zippered section on inside to store keys, money etc.  You can fit quite a bit of junk in the middle section.  The frame is flexible, so while it keeps its shape to hold things upright, mine also got a bit bent by the airlines when I forgot to detach it, but has bounced back without a problem.  Don't spend any extra - just buy one!"
Baby,5.0,Love It,"We bought this mobile based on the excellent reviews it received and are not disappointed.  The leaves open and close gently as the critters slowly rotate, and it mesmerizes our daughter.  She also loves the Rainforest sounds, although it comes with three types of classical music as well:  Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.  It was easy to assembly and install and even comes with a remote control.  My only complaint is the inability to have the mobile move without any music.  Overall we are very happy with this purchase."
Baby,5.0,So very useful,"Allows you to have items close and easy to grab as you push the stroller. In mine I keep my blackberry, a cloth to wipe the drool from baby's mouth which is a constant effort, and a snack bar for me and a bottle for baby."
Baby,4.0,Love the music,"Fun product with very nice musical sounds. Being musical, I enjoy playing songs for my little one on the elephants nose. However, I wish it would sit up on it's own better as advertised. Hope my child can play with it more on his own once he's older. For now he loves to listen to the songs and stare at the brightly colored fabric and big eyes."
Baby,5.0,Just what the doctor ordered,"Very useful product. I am elderly and sit on my front porch most of the day. I have wrought iron railings on the porch. I hang this product from the rails and use it for snacks and drinks when I need them. Two things would prove extremely helpful, additional straps at the bottom to match the ones at the top and I took some empty short sweet corn cans and cleaned them in the dishwasher and made sure of no sharp edges where they were opened and inserted them in the proper places and my can of diet Mountian Dew slips right in with just one hand and I do not have to wrestle with it to get it in the proper place. JB"
Baby,4.0,Baby likes this better than the similar Baby Einstein keys,"I bought this and the Baby Einstein activity keys with the button-activated light at the same time for my 8-month old, and she definitely prefers this one.  The \\""keys\\"" are more fun for her to handle and chomp, and the 3 buttons are easily activated, so that she's quickly figured out from accidental presses what they do.  The Einstein button is too hard for her to press, so she still hasn't figured out how to turn the light on.  The three sound effects, each followed by a little tune, are not too loud or annoying for me, and baby likes them."
Baby,2.0,Disappointed,"I loved the concept of an easy access wipes case with a strap; however, the snap on the strap broke the first time I tried to use it.  The wipes case is nice and large, but what's the point if you can't use the strap.  The case is a bit too large for my diaper bag."
Baby,5.0,Functional and portable,"Perfect accessory for strollers without a parent tray on the handles. Surprisingly large amount of storage. Easily removable to take into the car. And when done serving the baby's stroller, easily attaches to chair backs or anything with slots to store toys, crayons, kitchen utensils, etc."
Baby,5.0,Excellent Product!!! must buy!,"This is an excellent product, and creates an nice ambient for the baby to sleep.     good quality and the best price.    is a nice gift for expecting parents :)"
Baby,4.0,"Simple, sturdy, inexpensive and easily moved between strollers!","Bought this item for our City Mini Baby Jogger stroller as it was less than half the price of the accessory made specially for the stroller and I figured... \\""why not give it a shot?\\"" And it fits great! It took less than 30 seconds to attach the velcro straps to the handle bar on our City Mini and it's sturdy. There are two cup holders built in and the snug elastic material \\""hugs\\"" the cups so they stay in place while you stroll. You can easily move the elastic material to the side also and regain more space in the main compartment as needed. Can't beat the price and it's super easy to move to a different stroller as needed."
Baby,4.0,Love this!,"Too many strollers are made without a parent tray!  This is great to stash your personal items or small items for the baby like pacifiers, burp cloth, etc.  It's not very stable, so you may not want to use it for a store-bought coffee.  For the price, this can't be beat."
Baby,5.0,It Purrs!,"Love this toy for my baby.  Built inside the toy, theres a noise maker that makes the toy purr when moved or tilted, no batteries needed.  The baby also loves to grab hold the rings."
Baby,5.0,Great Buy!,"I bought this for my Peg Perego Aria OH stroller after looking at a lot of these.  I love it!  It has a stiff edge so it doesn't tip over and I can fit a 32 oz soda in the cup holder.  The cup holders are stretchy so it will hold all sizes of drinks (it doesn't hold a sippy cup, but I just put it in the middle)  And I can fold my stroller with it on.  I love it!"
Baby,3.0,great idea but needs some tweaking,"I bought this to go along with the Kolcraft contour stroller. Great idea and useful but needs a bit of tweaking. It attaches to each side of the stroller bars with Velcro which are one size fit all so it needed a bit of playing with. Also after one check on an airplane the Velcro did not hold up and it pulled apart, the piece is easily \\""sewable\\"" but it should have held."
Baby,4.0,"Full sized, not for hanging on the stroller",This case is much bigger than I expected. I thought I was getting a small case to hang on the side of the stroller to grab one or two occasionally. Instead it stores a lot of wipes to be put in the diaper bag. It fits nicely in the inside pocket of the skipp hopp diaper bag. The strap is a nice idea but I can't imagine that huge case dangling from anything.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for Britax Stroller (or similar),"I love my Britax stroller, but was lost without a drink/ wallet holder on top. This thing fits easily, works perfectly. It has a drink holder on each side and a small zipper/ mesh compartment for a few dollars in the middle open area.<br /><br />The canvas seems to wash up well. Very durable and practical. Our handle for our stroller flips down to bring the stroller up to you when sitting. This flips over the handle to hang on the handle in both positions.<br /><br />I would recommend also purchasing a similar thing for baby when he/she is older if you have the Britax stroller (or similar).<br /><br />I like the tasteful, simple black, but would have preferred some color/ pattern options. Or, maybe even a more intricate picture on one side for the baby to stare at...just a thought :)."
Baby,5.0,My best newborn purchase.,"I bought this mobile when my son was 8 weeks old and it was the first thing that made him stay in his crib without crying.  He would lie and just stare at it mesmerized by the slow movements and bright colors.  Coming in every 15 minutes to push a button sure beat standing there, winding up a mobile every couple minutes.      He's able to play on his own now that he's 16 weeks, but he still loves watching it.  It has never put him to sleep though, it gets him very excited and he \\""dances\\"" and laughs whenever I turn it on for him.  I use it without the lights and music and he still goes crazy for it.  I would say this is the best purchase I made for my newborn, as he loves it, it looks great in the nursery, and it saved me from having to hold him all the time!    Easy to put together and install, long-battery life, and overall excellent material quality."
Baby,5.0,We love it,"We're moving from the rainforest bassinet (with Mobile) to a big crib.  I really wanted to move to this mobile because it has the same \\""characters\\"" to it.  It is a bit quiet and on the bassinet mobile, I was able to start louder to get her attention and drown out other sounds, then turn down the sound once she was focused in and ready to be soothed -- this was very effective and I don't have that choice with this mobile.  Another thing the bassinet had was a flashing light feature that helped to draw her in and become ready to be soothed - also absent on this mobile.  The music on this mobile is better quality than on the bassinet mobile. This mobile is a very nice one and I am pleased with it, although I'd like it even better if the features from the bassinet mobile were incorporated into it."
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I have a Maclaren Triumph stroller. This has made me love my stroller. I purchased this based on the reviews on here. I was a little hesitant due to so many people saying that you need to take it on and off when closing the stroller. You do not need to take on and off. I did at first but then I had time to experiment a little and found that the attachment does not need to be snug tight in order to work. I have loosened the velcro attachment so that it is a larger loop. This allows you to close and open the stroller without the hassle of taking it on and off. Thank god! Cause it was a hassle to reattach it everytime. Now the attachment itself is so sturdy and allows drinks to ride securely with the wire frame and elastic. I trusted my hot coffee in it too as the cup holders are deep. I then toss my keys and cell phone and wallet in the mid section. I am so happy with the holder and its a great price compared to others.
Baby,5.0,This thing is awesome in so many ways!,"I bought this mobile for my granddaughter.  She LOVES it, I LOVE it!  A variety of tunes, the mobile action, the ability of the baby to turn it on themselves, the little night light that glows while it plays -- if you want it to. I have one of those sleigh bed cribs and this fits just great!  The old mobile was cute, had to be wound up, would play for a couple of minutes, and would not fit on the crib.  I can't believe that anyone would be unhappy with this product.  Some thought it was too quiet, but the only one that is supposed to hear the thing is the baby and it is just the right volume for lulling to sleep.  Ok, one thing was not too great:  the remote that came with it has a problem with line-of-sight for the crib position in the room.  But, I have yet to even think of using the remote.  Buy it!"
Baby,5.0,Mom's best friend,My son LOVES this activity gym.  It keeps him entertained just long enough for me to get things done around the house!
Baby,5.0,great product,i bought these in the hope that they would allow me to store breast milk in and they worked wonderfully.
Baby,5.0,The perfect mobile,"My sister-in-law bought me this mobile. It's very easy to put together. My newborn baby didn't seem interested in the mobile at first. But when she reached 2 months, she started to be mesmerized by the moving bright toys (especially the parrot and monkey). When she wakes up crying for her feeding, I would turn it on, and she would be distracted by the mobile, giving me time to prepare her bottle.    This mobile is probably the best one in the market. My baby loves it so much, she can spend 15 - 20 minutes (now close to 3 months) just looking at the mobile, listening to the music, and cooing to the stuffed animals."
Baby,5.0,Best Mobile,"This is probably to-date the best item that I have bought for my new baby. My daughter is 7 weeks old and she loves this mobile. She looks up at it and talks to the monkey who is staring down at her. That's a good feature in a mobile, that the toys with faces look down on the baby. This is something that prompted me to choose this mobile as opposed to the one that went with my baby's crib bedding. It's engaging but the leaves that sway up and down are also very lulling. The melodies are soothing and last a long time and if baby is still awake when the music stops, the mobile comes with a remote control so that you can turn it on again. This comes in handy at around 3am. I love this mobile and would recommend it to any new parent.  Update 03/2015 I just had my second child and I pulled this mobile out of storage. It still has the charm. My second baby loves it. The leaves got a bit bent out of shape but over time I was able to reshape them. Love, love, love this mobile."
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller Multi=purpose  Accessory,"This is by far the best invention as an accessory to a stroller that doesn't come with a cup holder. Not only it's easy to use; it can hold up to 2 cups/bottles of almost any size, you can also put your cel phone or snack in the middle tray. It is easy to install and easy to wash. Great job, amazon! I'd highly recommend this to every mom out there."
Baby,2.0,It was great until ...,"I was so excited to get this stroller accessory.  It was great for holding all my stuff, even the cups.  But, after a short time (2 months) the velcro ripped and I've not been able to fix it.  Not sure if I'm going to fix it or find something of better quality."
Baby,5.0,Works great on the Quinny Zapp,"My big complaint about the Quinny Zapp was that the basket was small and difficult to access when the child is in the stroller.  This stroller accessory fits perfectly between the handles of the stroller, and is the perfect size to hold keys, cell phone, small drinks, and make them easily accessible, without weighing down the top of the stroller."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,"I bough this mobile even before my son was born, and I played it to him since the very fist day. At first, I played the rainforest sounds only; I thought the melodies were kinda sad. However, when my son was about 2 months old, I started playing the melodies as well, to attract his attention. He would stare at it with delight and kick his legs in excitement. Even now, when he's 6 months old, it still catches his eye;although now he prefers being held up high to be able to touch the toys attached to the mobile.  I don't agree that it's not loud enough. The quieter mode is great to use in the evening, and the louder mode was just enough for us. Also, I don't know how often you people play the mobile during the day, to complain that you need to change batteries all the time. I have had the mobile for a little over 6 months and I change batteries twice! (Maybe those of you who complain about it should take your baby out of the crib sometimes and spend time with him, instead of making him listen to the mobile melodies all the time?!!)  The bottom line is that I loved it, and what is more, my son loved it! It's a great mobile worth it's price."
Baby,3.0,"Useful, but fell apart within a week!","We got this organizer to use with our Joovy Ergo Caboose.  It has a nice amount of room for cell phone, water bottles, keys, etc. and the zippered pocket is a plus. I was disappointed, however, when one of the straps popped off when I put a not-unreasonable amount of pressure on the organizer.  I've only had it in place for five days!  Seems to me that, even for $10, this should hold up better than that.  I am in Sweden and am unable to get a replacement easily, so I had a tailor fix it--for $9!  Could have just as easily bought another one for that."
Baby,5.0,LOVE THIS,"I have the little Maclaren stroller and there is no good place to put drinks, keys, cell phone, etc. This product has been AWESOME and is light enough that the stroller doesn't tip over backwards when you take out your child. EXCELLENT product!!"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,Great product.  I love the bright colors and it was very easy to put up.
Baby,5.0,never lose a pacifier again!,"The best thing about this pacifier, is that during the night, when all other pacifiers get lost or pushed out of the crib, this one is easy for my baby to find.  I have two and put both in his crib.  He finds it easily during the night and most times wakes up in the morning, still sucking on it!"
Baby,5.0,Works Great With City Mini,"I recently purchased the Baby Jogger City Mini and was not liking the price of the parent console baby jogger sold. I came across this and it works perfectly. It provides me with a place to store my keys, phone, pacifiers, wallet, and drink, which is exactly what I needed. It has a nice little zippered pocket you could place your ID in or some cash. So far I have only used the drink compartment with a can of soda, but it worked perfectly fine. The stroller also folds up perfectly with the buggy buddy attached and I like that I can easily move of it to a different stroller if I need to."
Baby,4.0,Great crib mobile!,"I purchased this mobile because of the reviews and because it looked bright and colorful online. I was hesitant at first because my daughters bedding is pink/brown and not a rainforest theme, however, she absolutely loves it. The moving leaves and colorful animals really draw her eyes to the unit and she will sit there and study it for seemingly forever. The music is pretty standard - classical, and it features a rainforest-like sound of crickets and frogs, birds, etc. The only feature I was disappointed in was the light. I was under the impression that the light on the main unit that attaches to the crib was more dramatic. It is just a bulb that shines light through the base. Not much to look at so my daughter really only cares about it during the day when she can actually see it. Otherwise at night, it's good for the music and rainforest sound.    Anyhow, I still think this is a great mobile and would recommend it to all. Oh, and it comes with a remote activator so you can turn it on while in bed or at the nursery door! It is a nice feature."
Baby,5.0,Great addition to our MaClaren Umbrella Stroller,"This is a great addition to our MaClaren Quest Sport umbrella stroller.  It attaches perfectly onto the handles and holds a lot for a tiny little pouch. Has 3 sections as shown in the picture. The middle section was large enough to hold my canon hg20 camcorder and other small items like sunglasses, keys, etc.  This is a must have if you own an umbrellas stroller with no storage space."
Baby,5.0,"Great, inexpensive stroller caddy","I bought one of these to use on our Baby Jogger City Mini double stroller instead of the expensive Baby Jogger accessory. It works great and is an excellent value for the price. I've had no problem with sippy cups, bottled water, paper cups from Starbucks, etc. It stays on when you fold up the stroller and the center pocket is great for keys, cell phone, a snack cup, or whatever small items you need to stash.  (Edited to add: On the double, it attaches to the center perpendicular bar and then either of the outsides of the stroller handle.)"
Baby,5.0,Awesome product!!,"I love this wipes case! It's great. I'm able to fit a ton of wipes in it and then the little red thing just slide back for me to get to them. The only problem I have with it is, my 20 month old got a hold of it and she took the red button off a little easier than I would've liked, but it popped right back on."
Baby,5.0,can't beat it for the price,"I looked at similar stroller organizers/cup holders for three times the price and I'm glad I went with this one.  It definitely gets the job done and you can't beat the price.  I was concerned that it wouldn't be strong enough to hold everything, but it is quite sturdy.  Also, there is a small zippered pocked in the main open console area, so you can put money or keys there if you are worried about them being out in the open.  It fits great on our baby jogger city mini - I highly recommend this product."
Baby,2.0,"I love Skip Hop products, but not this one.","This case is okay.  It has a strap, which is sort of nice, but I'd like it better if it were longer.  The button pops off and does not slide (at least not on mine) and so getting wipes out is a big hassle.  The case also pops open and does not seal especially well.  I was hoping this would be a good solution for me.  I need to carry lots of wipes (I have 3 young children) and the standard travel wipe cases hold approximately 6 wipes, whereas this one holds more.  I like that the case holds more wipes, but they are useless if you can't get them out or if the case opens and they all fall out on the ground.  Don't waste your money on this one."
Baby,1.0,Worthless and Overpriced!,"I can't imagine any baby being interested in this.  There is really not much to it, the velcro pieces pull off easily, the music player hangs down in the baby's face so if they roll over they hit their head on it, and the mirror/ball/flap on the end is pointless.  The flap was almost permanently folded down, the ball barely spins, and the mirror is tiny.  My son never cared anything for this playmat; when he got a little older he used it to stand up.  All in all, this thing is a complete waste of money.  If this playmat actually entertains a baby, it won't last very long."
Baby,2.0,Not working like I'd hoped it would.,"Some friends had suggested I get a Wubbanub since, especially on car rides, my baby would spit out his pacifier and start crying.  No way to reach to the backseat and put it back in.    Unfortunately, the Wubbanub comes with a Soothie brand pacifier attached, and my baby simply does not take a Soothie.  So he makes a face and spits it out every time, and we're back to square one.  Now that he's 14 weeks and can grab things more easily, he seems to like to play with the Wubbanub, but in that case I could just have gotten a stuffed animal at the dollar store!  Cute idea, but unless there's a way to get one with an Avent pacifier (or Nuk or Mam or whatever else other babies like), this hasn't been the miracle it was for other parents."
Baby,5.0,Nice!!!,I bought it to compliment the city mini stroller and it perfectly match. It is a lot cheaper than the city mini and it does the job... I recommend this product to any mom without space in the stroller.
Baby,5.0,daycare mom,This product is perfect for all of our strollers.  I would highly recommend it.  I have not had any issues with it as of yet.
Baby,5.0,Perfect decor for my dorm room!,"This baby mobile is perhaps the best thing I have ever invested in. As a freshmen at Princeton, I was pretty nervous about starting college. However, I knew one of the ways I could bring my childhood and home with me was by decorating my room with a piece that evokes not only the playful and carefree nature of childhood, but also serves as a deep and penetrating metaphor for the ironic and misogynistic philosophies of many modern house cats. Ever since I was a youngin, I have been tortured by the heartless attitude that house cats have toward me. I felt that I would be lost if I didn't continue to harbor my hatred of these creatures while exploring my collegiate interests and broadening my world view. Hanging this mobile in my dorm room has helped me to become an active global citizen, in my opinion. I have garnered the respect of many of my professors as well as the other students on my floor. I highly suggest that an parent endeavoring to educate and enlighten their child, regardless of age, buy this mobile and hang it directly about their pillow. It is the will of the forest nymphs that all children become enlightened. That is why I have this mobile, and why my parents were willing to pay many dollars to give me a gift that I love. I encourage you to do the same for your own child! You will not regret giving them this one of a kind opportunity."
Baby,4.0,Good mobile,I don't know that much about mobiles.  I looked at the reviews on Amazon and purchased it based on past customer ratings.  My baby boy seems to like.  The construction seems pretty good.  I would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Baby,4.0,My son loves it!,We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he just loved it!  He's currently 7 months old and still enjoys looking at the bright colored animals but is now more interested in the music box that is attached to the side of the crib.  Overall it is very colorful and children will enjoy it.  The only drawback is that the music is sometime not loud enough.
Baby,2.0,good in theory but not so practical,"I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews and thought this may be something to help my little one sleep. We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the plush toy but I was willing to deal with it at the time. However, it really would be a much better product if there was a way to separate for cleaning."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,"I purchased the Buggy Buddy to go with my new Graco IPO stroller.  It attaches to individual handles or a single handlebar.  The pictures aren't clear enough to show that the cup/bottle holders expand to hold many different sizes and it holds them snuggly.  There is a zipper pocket for keys, cell phone, etc. and a decent amount of open space for whatever else you need.  My stroller still folds easily with the Buggy Buddy attached.  Perfect solution for smaller strollers w/out a parent tray."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic mobile - wish I'd gotten it sooner!,"I was a bit skeptical of this mobile mostly because it looked so large in the pictures, and also because I thought I probably wanted a mobile that played lullabys instead of classical music.  However, when I saw this on clearance at Walmart, when my son was 5 months old, I decided to try it -- and now only regret I didn't get it sooner!  It is definitely a large mobile, but that became a non-issue, and the classical music is great.  The leaves and animals move slowly and calmly but have interesting colors and features, which keeps a baby's interest while not being over-stimulating.  There are four sound options (rainforest and three different classical composers), which if selected will run for about 15 minutes each before automatically shutting off.  No frequent resetting and no winding-up necessary -- a definite plus.  There are three options for light/music, light/music/motion, and music/motion, so it's not possible for the mobile to work with just motion and no sound, but you can have the nightlight off.    The music is slow-tempo, soothing and relatively quiet and has helped my son fall asleep countless times over the past six months.  We removed the mobile arm as soon as he could stand up, and switched the music/light/motion option at just music and light.  He absolutely loves pushing the big, colorful buttons to turn the music on and off by himself.    Practical notes: My initial set of D batteries is still going fine after six months, so they don't need frequent changing.  The mobile was easy to assemble and it was easy to detach the mobile arm when needed.  The only negative was that the on/off remote never seemed to work for \\""on\\"" for me -- only \\""off\\"" -- even when aligned as instructed.  Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,"love it, love it, love it","This product is adorable.  The lighting is perfect, not too bright. two volume settings for the music.  I personally enjoy listening to the music over the moniter.  It is very soothing.  Most favorite part, I didn't realize the leaves on the mobile moved up and down as well as around.  I had been rocking my daughter to sleep for the last four months.  Couldn't take it one more day.  She fell asleep watching it and took a 3 hour nap."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!!!  Best thing we could have bought for our Disney Trip!,"Our stroller does not have a cup holder or any type of compartment on it to store anything besides the basket.  We needed something for our week long trip to Disney World with our 2 year old.  This was great!  It held water bottles, cans, and 20 oz cups very well.  We could also get 32 oz cups in it relatively easily by stretching the elastic a little.  The zipper compartment is small, but it would hold a couple of little things.  The middle compartment between the cup holders would hold both by camera and my phone.  I highly recommend this!!"
Baby,5.0,Great Caddy - Great Price!!!,"I bought this to fit on my Dream on Me Adjustable Handle Stroller which doesn't have any cup holders or trays.  It fits perfectly and will hold any drink - including a cold coffee drink from Starbucks or a water bottle.  It's got plenty of room and the metal frame really makes a difference in that it always stays open.  I have to attach it on a slanted portion on my stroller handle because of the way my stroller is, so to offest the slant I attached one side by twisting the velcro before putting it on and it stays level with no problem.  GREAT PRODUCT!!"
Baby,3.0,Won't fit a convertible crib,"Seems like a great product, but I was quite upset that it wouldn't attach to our convertible crib.  The top \\""ledge\\"" of the crib is too wide."
Baby,5.0,Works great with our Quinny Zapp Stroller,"I bought this for my Quinny Zappy stroller because it doesn't have any accessories that come with it. It's great and I love it. Perfect if you don't have to collapse the stroller. When I do need to take it in the car I leave the buggy buddy in the trunk but it's great for using on daily walks around the city. I put my camera, wristlet, baby food, and bottle of water and keys in there and there's still room left over. Highly recommend. Can easily fit on any stroller since it has velcro straps that are adjustable to most style of strollers. Must have if your stroller didn't come with cup holders.<br /><br />I have spilt soda a couple of times so if you have a drink that is in a can I would recommend drinking half of it before putting it in the holder. I put tissue at the bottom just in case and it does the job just fine."
Baby,3.0,Take or leave it,"I bought this for my 5 month old because he loved Freddie the Firefly but had already had Freddie for 3 months so I thought it was time for something new. For some reason he just doesn't seem interested in this toy. It makes a \\""roar\\"" when you tip him. He likes to put the hands into his mouth but the teething toys are attached to it so he just seems frustrated by it. Lamaze has great toys but this one was not a winner with my little guy. He has had Freddie since birth and still prefers it to Logan. Go figure."
Baby,5.0,An Absolute Favorite,My son LOVES all 4 of his Lamaze toys and gives big grins in response to the sweet smiling faces. Mommy likes that this can attach to his crib bumper so he can bat and pull and the lion never gets away.  He also makes a neat noise with a ball rolling inside his head.
Baby,5.0,Sanity saver - SO worth the cost,"Our daughter was about two months old when she started noticing movement and objects, and I needed a break now and again, so we started shopping for mobiles. I always liked the look of the Tiny Love ones, but the reviews were mixed and the Symphony mobile was out of stock just about everywhere, and in retrospect I'm so glad I got the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile instead.      We've been using this daily for almost four months now and haven't had to change the batteries yet.  Our daughter absolutely loves it - both the moving animals and the nightlight.  I love the four music selections, two volume levels, and the durability.  We're almost to the point where we'll be removing the moving part of the mobile, but the nightlight and music section will stay.  The remote control has enough range that we're able to use it from our bed in the adjoining room.  This is a great product - I happily recommend it to anyone who asks about it, and will continue to buy Fisher Price products."
Baby,4.0,Eddie the Elephant is a really fun toy.,"This is one of baby's favorite toys.  Nice music, colors, textures, and patterns.  Very interactive.     No five star rating for four reasons:    (1) Too few songs and too short segments of songs.  (2) Too short record time.  (3) Notes on trunk are quite difficult to press.  (4) Tricky to press the spot that must be pressed to initiate music.    These issues mean that someone other than baby must constantly press different parts of the elephant in lieu of baby for quite some time until baby learns to do it alone."
Baby,5.0,Love this pacifier,"I got these for my new grandson, who is a pacifier baby with pretty good hand control at four months (just!) and we all love them.  I am buying more to have around to give as gifts--my son-in-law's idea!"
Baby,5.0,Best Infant Pacifier,"In my practice the majority of my patients are infants and children. In my office and in the nursery we offer the soothie pacifier for comfort and infants who will not suck on another pacifier are comforted by the soothie. The wubbanub was originally recommended to me by one of my patients mothers. She has triplets and stated it was a \\""lifesaver\\"". My granddaughter who is 4 months old has both the frog and now the monkey wubbanub she and my daughter love them."
Baby,2.0,Not very sturdy,"This item is good for holding your cell phone, kleenex or a water bottle but don't put too much in it. One of the straps broke on ours and we really didn't put too much in it. In fact I think we had two water bottles and some keys in there. It's not good for drinks that aren't completely closed. We had our take out coffee cups in it and they kept sloshing around. It serves it's purpose in holding the few things we want to bring with us but nothing more."
Baby,5.0,he loves it,"We just purchased this for our infant son and he loves it.  The figures point down so he can see them well.  The leaves flap which he also seems to like.  The music choices and rainforest sounds are quite nice.  We haven't used the remote control yet, but sure it will come in handy.  He's entertained the entire run time.  Definitely a good mobile."
Baby,5.0,Quit looking and just buy this one.,"Fantastic mobile! I purchased this when my daughter was 6 weeks old and she absolutely loves it. My husband had to build a mount for it to hang on the wall since she sleeps in a pack-n-play and it wouldn't attach to the model we have. Anyway, she will watch the mobile for nearly half an hour just kicking her legs and talking to the turning animals. It keeps her very entertained. I love it!"
Baby,5.0,"Nice little cup, key and everything holder!","This really came in handy with my McClaren Volo - a very lightweight umbrella stroller. When I bought the stroller originally, the other cupholder could only be attached at an angle on the side of the stroller - drinks that were open even slightly would slosh all over the place. This stroller buddy saved me! Love it."
Baby,5.0,Great item,"I love this!  It's perfect for keys, beverages (mine and baby's), as well as a quick place to put any toys that baby has thrown to the ground!"
Baby,4.0,Cute,"This monkey is super cute.  Dd is just discovering it and loves to wave it around.  Its a great binky to take out and about since I tend to loose these when they go flying out of the baby's mouth.  The only down side is that the binky is permanently attached to the monkey.  So you really cannot sterilize the binky and washing it gets the monkey all wet, which you're not supposed to do.  I still like it.      edited- oops, I didn't read the tag correctly.  Turns out you can throw the whole thing in the laundry.  Works great."
Baby,3.0,Ok,This item was nice but the music did not work.  Baby like it alot so used another music mobile playin at same time as this one.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful Product,We love using the sealing discs for making bottles and mixing the formula.  They work wonders.
Baby,5.0,Daughter loves it,My baby daughter thinks this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. There are way fewer nap time fusses. When we put her down and turn it on she is asleep before it finishes 90% of the time
Baby,3.0,Warps and stains in dishwasher.,"I bought these disks to use with my Avent bottles for storing breast milk and later homemade baby food. I've been using them for about two months now, and had to order more. I have had no problems washing my other Advent products in the dishwasher on the delicate setting, but these sealing disks warped after several washes and stained a light orange after one. I have ordered more and will have to hand wash them."
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Mobile,"The Fisher-Price Rainforest Mobile is just what I was looking for for my grandson. He just LOVES it--especially when the leaves open and close. It was shipped in a timely manner, and I received it within a matter of days. I would definitely recommend this product and seller!"
Baby,4.0,Decent Product,"I have read alot of reviews that the buggy buddy have to be REMOVED BEFORE closing any stroller.<br />I was skeptical and have 2nd thoughts after ordered it from Amazon..<br />To my SURPRISE, I used it with my stroller Inglesina Zippy 2010 model, I HAVE NO PROBLEM closing and opening with the buggy buddy still hooked at the handle!! I have tried it several times, closing and opening it, NO ISSUE!! I tried putting the biggest cup and a middle sz cup, it fit well.. but of course it is abit shaky so NO HOT cup with this!! VERY HAPPY!!"
Baby,5.0,very good,"This is great. It fits my UPPA VISTA stroller very well. It's a difficult stroller to fit with a caddy because the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them. Considering the price, the material is really good and insulated. You can't see it in the picture but there is a small zippered pocket in the center. The cup holders are large enough to fit a coffee cup (which will sit upright) and you can fit larger water bottles in there because they are stretchable."
Baby,5.0,Useful!,I love this case.  I've been asked by moms watching me use it where did I get it.  I like that I can hang it off the stroller or anywhere else as needed which is useful for me.  The case makes it easier to get to wipes and I can resupply as needed.
Baby,5.0,Awesome for tummy-time haters,"In order to get my baby into the \\""front to play, back to sleep,\\"" I bought this toy. My daughter HATED tummy-time, but the spinner elevated her, so tummy-time became bearable for a couple minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc. Two days ago, she was happily on the spinner for 20 mins. However, yesterday, she started turning over, so we removed the spinner. The mat is fun too, lots of contrasting colors to catch baby's attention!"
Baby,3.0,Mixed feelings,"my 4mo old loves the mat and cover...yet doesn't love the spin feature. He's ok -not great- with tummy time and I was hoping this would help. Sometimes it works for a few minutes, other times not at all. It also seems to bother his tummy a bit- can be a plus if you just can't get that burp out...after he comes up from this there it is! But again, he loves staring at the mat while sitting on my lap...or even if i hold it up for him to play with he is excited...would love it more if he used the spinner..."
Baby,4.0,Just what I needed,"My 2 umbrella-style strollers had no cup holders and this product solved that problem. Easy to use.  To fold the strollers I just un-Velcro one side of the Buddy, flatten it, and tuck it into the stroller fabric. Since it is all fabric, it can be tricky getting a paper coffee cup into the holders, but just leave the cardboard cup-cozy in the holder- works great!  Also has plenty of room to hold small snacks, napkins, tissues....  Best of all, I bought 2 for the price of one other brand holder."
Baby,5.0,great bang for ur buck!,"this is a great caddy for umbrella strollers. and for $8, you can't beat the price or storage it comes with. it can hold up to 5 drinks and has a great zippered compartment for valuables. i was looking for a drink holder for my stroller and an attachment for just one drink was over $8, so this is by far the best. i purchased two for both of my chicco capri strollers"
Baby,1.0,Does not fit on convertible crib,"I will be returning this mobile, unfortunately - it will not fit on the Ragazzi Etruria shaker stage crib, and I feel there might be similar issues with other convertible cribs - a definite design flaw, considering the current popularity of convertible crbs.  The top railing is too high to allow the crib to be mounted, since the lip determines the placement, and the bottom of the mobile does not come down far enough to expose the hole where the clamp attaches.   Wish I knew about this before I ordered - every other Fisher-Price model shows the mounting in pictures, and all the other mobiles use straps to hold it in place, not a lip plus clamp, and this mounting style was NOT apparent in any of the stock photos.  Not recommended for convertible cribs."
Baby,5.0,Great Toy,I love it for my daughter. She gets to cuddle the monkey while sucking on her binkie. It also helps when ever it drops it doesn't always land on the nipple side and gets dirty.
Baby,5.0,His Favorite,Our son got this along with the Baby Einstein fish aquarium for our baby shower.  I will tell you he thinks this mobile is so great.  We put him in his cradle and use the Nighttime Sounds with motion and he just smiles and falls right asleep.  I think this is a great product and just a fun way to keep him entertained once you put them down.  We also love the fact that it has a remote!!
Baby,5.0,not bad for the money,not bad for the money    My daughter likes it especially when I make the animals swing.  If it could do that automatically it would be perfect.
Baby,5.0,great product!,There's not much to say. It's a great product and I haven't had any problems with it.
Baby,5.0,"Great for Special Needs Kids, too!","My daughter has cerebral palsy and this toy has helped build her neck and back muscles quite a bit. She also seemed to have fun and it didn't seem like exercise to her at all. It did take some getting used to, but by about the 4th or 5th time, she was loving it."
Baby,5.0,Works great on UPPABaby Vista!,"I recently purchased an UPPABaby Vista, but the cup holder you have to purchase separately from UPPA Baby is a joke.  I had tried a couple of different, more expensive stroller organizers (Joovy organizer, Prince Lionheart cup holder) and none worked, so since the Sunshine Kids organizer was so inexpensive, I decided to give it a whirl and boy was I pleased to see it worked!<br /><br />Not only does this have 2 cup holders (one for me and one for baby.  It also has a zippered pocket and other larger compartment to keep my cell phone, extra binky's etc...<br /><br />For anyone who bought an UPPABaby Vista and is looking for a great alternative to the waste of money cup holder from UPPA Baby!  I also like that you can collapse the stroller without having to detach it!  So glad I found this product!!!!"
Baby,4.0,Good enough for the purpose,"I was going to bye   a cup holder for my Baby Vista,that wasn't included (weird when you buy $700 stroller!),but after reading some negative reviews I changed my mind and bought this  item. It is not ideal,but it's ok and serve it's purpose"
Baby,5.0,Happy with this purchase,Granddaughter finds it entertaining.  She especially likes the baby giggle sound made by pushing one of the buttons.  Not too loud so is pleasant  to hear over and over!
Baby,5.0,The Lion that Changes Lives,"I remember the first time I heard Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G Minor and I imagine it's the same way kids feel when they leave the world of black and white panda toys or board books and come face to face with Logan the Lion.<br /><br />\\""This is what I'm talking about,\\"" they must think, their eyes greedily devouring the bright red mane and the explosion of colors that stream away from it. \\""I don't know what those blue and green circles are called,\\"" I imagine them saying, \\""but I'm going to eat them up--and that purple star too--even if it means I have to puke out a rainbow!\\""<br /><br />Logan the Lion is that good. He's a sensorial blast of different textures and bright colors. He's cheerful. And he's an unforgettable introduction to the wonderful world of colors. \\""That black and white stuff is OK,\\"" they must think while raising Logan up in their hands, in sync with a rising smile, \\""but this is what life is all about.\\"""
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money,I bought this thinking it would be easier than the city mini parent console for double strollers and I didn't want to spend the money. I should have just spent the $30 because this broke within the first month. It is made from cheap material and the straps are very weak. My strap broke and I wound up having to throw it away while we were on vacation so I had no cup holder. Save your money and don't bother with this product.
Baby,5.0,Love it,"My life is divided into two: before I purchased this item and after :-).  It was an essential for my baby jogger. I put there my cell phone, keys, water bottle etc. Very sturdy. Love it."
Baby,5.0,Our daughter loves it!,We bought this for our 8 week old daughter when we transitioned her to te criband she loves it. One of her first smiles was at this mobile. It plays music and has a nightlight. It kind of lulls her to sleep. We recommend it
Baby,2.0,"Can't Use if Your Top Rail is > 3 & 3/4""","I wish there had been some way to tell before ordering, but this mobile will not fit your crib if your top rail is any bigger than about 3 and 3/4 inches tall.  There is a plastic lip on the upper back side of the mobile that is supposed to rest on the top of your crib rail - no problem so far - but there is also a lower lip a few inches down.  If your rail doesn't fit between these two lips, you can still tighten the clamp, but the mobile won't lay flat against the crib, and it could easily be bumped and fall on the baby and/or scratch the crib. I have the Babyletto Mercer crib, and the top rail is just about 1/4\\"" too tall for the mobile.     It is too bad because it is a wonderful mobile - I loved the bright colors, adorable animals, leaf movement, and musical choices (though the rainforest one was especially quiet). The music is not grating, static-y, or tinny sounding like so many baby products.  If there were any way I could keep this, I would.  Hopefully, I can find a similar one that attaches differently."
Baby,2.0,don't waste your money,"I am still using this thing because it kind of works, I guess. But it seems to be really cheaply made. The red sliding button does not slide easily, so it is not a one handed function, which was supposed to be the whole point right? And it pops off easily (my 2 year old pulled it right off in seconds). I don't mind the bulkiness that others have mentioned, because it does hold a lot of wipes, which I appreciate. But it doesn't snap tightly enough, so the wipes will dry out if you you are not very careful. The strap is a nice idea in theory, but I would be to afraid the thing would pop open if I tried to hang it from a stroller handle or something. Bottom line: just go with the little huggies one filled with wipes that you can get at almost any local store."
Baby,3.0,its ok...,"I bought this for my Maclaren Techno Stroller and at first I loved it. BUT if you forget to take it off before folding the stroller it gets bent horribly and its hard to flatten back out. THEN one of the straps came off after only 3 weeks of use. I sewed it back on, but it was hard to go throught the thick material. Over all I would not buy this item again. I have a Munkin Cup holder that I use for my Camelbak water bottle now.  I wish it worked better, its a great idea"
Baby,5.0,ON THE LIST OF MUST HAVES!!,"As a Grandmother of twin girls. I can tell you this is the best investment I have made thus far, and I am a Grandma so you know I have made many..lol The mobile makes the girls happy and they light up when they see it moving and the leaves going up and down. The characters are so cute and colorful. This mobile would accent any decor!! I had the old wind up type prior to receiving this one, and though it was cute, it always annoyed them both when it stopped, along with the loud clanking of winding it back up,  the disturbance of CLANK, CLANK, CLANK was both annoying and inconvenient. This wonderful mobile buys me the time that I need to prepare bottles, or change a diaper while the other is enjoying the music rainforest show!! I love it because they love it, it is convenient and the babies sleep so well undisturbed. With twins, one baby can easily awake the other, but with one tiny click the soothing music begins and the characters move around and they are back into their peaceful sleep. Fisher Price I have always loved your toys, and grew up with them myself. I am impressed with the way you have kept up with new and innovative ways of entertaining babies/kids. You have really outdone yourself with this mobile and I love the crib aquarium soother of which I will be leaving a review about as well. Thank you from my twins and I!! Amazon, you again exceeded my expectations by delivering my package BEFORE estimated delivery date. You have outstanding service and deserve KUDOS as well!! I see a long relationship into the future!! :)"
Baby,5.0,Adorable,My 2 month old loves it.  I hang it on her swing and she stares and smiles at it all the time.
Baby,5.0,Long Lasting!,I love this mobile!!! I wish they made more like this. The best features are when they get older you can take the top part off and still leave the music part attached to the crib and when they are old enough they can hit the buttons themselves to start the music.  I had planned to save this mobile for my 2nd baby but my son is now almost 3 and still uses this every night!  If he wakes up in the night he can easily reach up and touch one of the buttons.  It even has a little night light in it.  I think I've only changed the batteries twice.  Now that I am getting ready to have another baby (even though my decor is not this rain forest theme) I am seriously considering getting another one of these!! It's well worth the money.
Baby,4.0,"Great mobile, doesn't fit on crib","I really like this mobile.  There are 4 music choices - all of which sound nice.  And, the mobile has lots of bright colors, which attract the baby's attention.  There are also options for increasing the volume, turning off the motion, and turning off the light.  My only complaint is that it doesn't fit on my son's crib (Babyletto Modo Crib), so I had to attach it to a short chair instead.  My son can look at it when he's in his bouncy seat.  I've heard that mobiles can hinder sleep when they are attached to the crib, so I'm not too worried about having the mobile as entertainment for my son in his chair instead of on his crib."
Baby,5.0,so cute,This is a wonderful and fun way to keep track of your baby's paci.  My daughter is not really a paci baby but she does love her monkey.  It also makes it easy for little ones to find their paci while in the crib.
Baby,5.0,So far so good!,"This mobile is cute and easy to assemble.  Haven't turned it on yet (note to self: get D batteries!), so I can't attest to quality or staying power.  I really like that it can convert into a music box/nightlight for later stages.  For those who are wondering about attachment, it essentially hooks onto the back of the crib and is tightened with a big plastic nut.  I was a little worried about fit as I have a sleigh-style crib, but it was not a problem, and feels plenty sturdy. Can't wait to see it in action!"
Baby,3.0,wubbanubb monkey,"THe seller was great the monkey was shipped fast! But, my daughter is 3 months old so obviously cant do much wear and tear on anything yet. And the monkey's ear was coming off, the thread unraveled after about a month. Not cool, especially because with shippping it cost me $19 to get this for her. i expected it to last much longer!"
Baby,5.0,Works GREAT with a Mutsy 4 Rider!,"Used with my Mutsy 4rider light. Doesn't slide down handle, stays in place. Leveled. Holds all my items and doesn't tilt at all. I love it."
Baby,5.0,Awesome product!,"I only wish my newborn would take a pacifier because this would be the one. We used these for my second son, and yes, it does help keep it in much better, but my biggest applause for it is that we only bought two of them!! With other pacifiers, we bought so many of them b/c they would fall somewhere or get lost and it was just ridiculous. We much have bought 20 pacifiers for my first son, which equaled more than the two WubbaNubs together. I absolutely love these, and like I said, am a little sad my newborn won't take one.    My second son also used the animal like a lovey, so not only did he always have his hand on it, which kept it from landing on the floors while out, but he also learned to put his pacifier back in really easily and really fast."
Baby,3.0,Great in theory but...,"...it just doesn't last!  We bought our first Buggy Buddy about a year ago to use with our City Mini Stroller.  We were excited to find a reasonably-priced, well-reviewed solution to the sippy cup/water bottle/miscellaneous items problem.  Alas, after a few months, the strap on the left tore, making the Buddy quite useless.  Thinking perhaps we had over-loaded the compartments, we bought a SECOND Buggy Buddy a few months ago.  Today, the SAME strap ripped--naturally while on the way into a store--and my water bottle, phone, wallet, and granola bar all went flying everywhere.  I will NOT buy a third one, but will go search for a more rugged option...it's too bad though, because the concept is exactly what is needed!"
Baby,1.0,Very disappointed,"This mobile didn't even last two weeks. It stopped turning around when the motor stopped working. When I called Fisher Price they were not helpful at all. They wanted me to pay to return it to them and then wait 6 to 8 weeks for the replacement to show up in the mail. I fought them about it an they agreed to pay for the shipping. Now I have to wait 6 to 8 weeks for the replacement and hope that one works. By then my son missed out on so much time he could have been enjoying it. He loved it for the two weeks it worked and then I had to take it away from him to get it replaced. It's so upsetting. Reading reviews for all the mobiles I find that the motors seem to brake on all of them. I bought my son a toy aquarium from Disney's Baby Einstein that lights up, plays music and ocean sounds and has movement as a replacement for the mobile. He really likes that. I would recommend buying something like that and not spend the money on a mobile with a motor. A stationary colorful mobile that gives a baby something to look at above there head would be nice also. It would be cheaper than buying one with a motor and you don't have to deal with the motor braking."
Baby,4.0,The baby loves it.,"I like this product, other than the fact that the remote is kinda useless.  I wish that you would be able to use the remote to turn on the mobile anytime you want, but it only stays active for like 10 minutes tops and then you have to hit one of the buttons on the actual mobile for it to be able to be shut off or on with the remote.  But, the baby really likes it and she usually falls alseep within the playing time of the song and it's not much needed.  I haven't used the remote at all."
Baby,5.0,great product,This product is easy to install and fits on our crib which has a rather large railing.  My son loves looking at this and I can do some things around the house while he plays quietly in his crib.
Baby,5.0,Just what I was looking for!,"After a lot of looking, I finally decided on the FP Rainforest Mobile.  My daughter (3 months) loves looking at it.  What I like is that the music and movement are both gentle enough not to over stimulate her, but fun enough to watch that it entertains her.  We have not yet used the nightlight, but I'm sure we will when she gets a little older."
Baby,5.0,Love it,"I LOVE it!  I was skeptical at first, but thought that for the price, it was worth a shot.  It is great and works on my perego pliko quite nicely.  I keep my keys, phone, a sippy cup and a 32 oz styrofoam cup in it.  I really wanted something that would be able to hold a 32 oz drink and it does just that.  Definitely worth the money!!"
Baby,5.0,AWESOME and PERFECT for my stroller!!,"We have the Peg Perego UNO style stroller which came with 1 cup holder that goes on the side of the stroller.  Our stroller is pretty wide for a single rider stroller so it made it difficult when going through doors or small aisles with the cup holder.  Putting the stroller in and out of the car finally broke the plastic cup holder leaving us with nothing.  I bought this item hoping it would be the solution and YES YES YES.  It was worth it.  I can keep my keys zipped up in the pocket along with my chapstick,my son's snack bag, and 2 drinks.  I was worried it would shake all over the place but it doesn't.  It stays in one place and doesn't rock back and forth.  I can also keep it attached to the stroller and fold it up.  It doesn't need to be removed each time which is great so it doesn't get lost!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
Baby,4.0,this is my new must have item for babies,my almost 2 month old loves this paci.  my only complaint is that it is sewn together so how does one efficiently clean either the monkey or paci??
Baby,5.0,Three month old baby loves his new rainforest mobile.,Our three month old son loves this mobile. It's definitely loud enough for him to enjoy it but not so loud that it prevents him from falling asleep when he's tired.  His favorite is the Bach tunes. He intently watches the leaves and the figures and is quite captivated by the whole thing.  The mobile runs just about the perfect length of time to keep him interested in it. We wish we had bought it even sooner.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"We have 4 babies and by them having their own animal, we always know who's is whos."
Baby,3.0,"Great toy, but strong smell of plastic.",My son loves this toy... the little sounds are cute.  But the smell of plastic is very strong and it makes me a little uncomfortable when my son puts it in his mouth...
Baby,5.0,Love it,"We actually bought this at Buy Buy Baby for $14.99 plus tax, but my baby just loved it in the store so we had to get it.  He is 7 mos old."
Baby,4.0,"Good product, should have gotten sooner.","This is a great mobile, has lots of settings and the baby can turn it on and off. I waited till my son was 8 months old and I think that was too late. He likes it ok, but it doesn't help him sleep or be happy sitting in his crib alone."
Baby,5.0,"Great purchase, very convenient","We added this to our UPPA baby stroller and have been very happy with it. Holds keys, cells, cups, snacks, etc. very well. GREAT purchase!"
Baby,4.0,My baby liked it!,"We bought this when my baby girl needed some tummy time.  She hated tummy time, but loved to lay on her back and stare at the toys.  I think this gym was helpful when she was learning to reach and grab at toys, too.  She even loved to sit in her Bumbo and play with the toys from that angle.  Overall, we got a lot of play time hours out of this gym, and I even made up words to the song the little white tiger plays."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,Great mobile!  It is a little quiet but it's for helping a baby relax and sleep so it really shouldn't be that loud.
Baby,5.0,"sturdy, good price","This is wonderfully sturdy, not flimsy like other parent accessories I tried out.  You can't beat the price.  I am very happy with it. It fits my Baby Jogger City Mini Double perfectly."
Baby,1.0,Not intended for fold-up umbrella stroller,"I have a Chicco Capri umbrella stroller and wanted a basic cup holder for it. After one use, it was clear that this product is not intended for a stroller that folds up for storage. When the stroller was folded, the cup holder also folded in half which broke the wire that gives the cup holder some structure. The sharp wire poked out of the canvas and presented a dangerous scratching or poking hazard. If you were to take the cup holder off the stroller every time, this would probably not have happened, but I wanted a cup holder that I could just leave on the stroller. I have a hard time believing I am the first person that this has happened to...who wants to remove the cup holder every time you put the stroller back in the car?    I had my husband trim off the excess wire to make the cup holder more \\""fold-able\\"", still trying to make it work out (I really wanted this cup holder!). The very next use, the velcro straps that attach the cup holder to the stroller ripped off, making the whole thing worthless. A complete waste of money for a poorly designed and cheaply made product.     Still searching for that cup holder!"
Baby,5.0,Great removable storage for Maclaren Quest,"I purchased this removable storage bag for my Maclaren Quest, and I don't have any complaints about it. It comes very handy on walks, since it can fit 2 cups or bottles, snacks, cellphone, keys, wallet. All the little stuff you might need on a walk. It stays in place and doesn't lose its shape if it's not packed. It's a cheap, but quality alternative, if you need an additional storage on your Maclaren. You have to remove it if you are folding the stroller, but that would be inevitable with any additional removable storage accessory, since it's a very compact umbrella stroller. Great invention!"
Baby,5.0,Just what I needed!,This stroller accessory works great with my Baby Jogger City Classic stroller. It's just what I needed and I use it every day.  I highly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Better than $30 one!,"I bought this to use on my large BabyJogger II-20, which was given to me by a friend w/big kids now.  I'd sorely missed a place to put my stuff while walking!  This is at least equal to the BabyJogger brand console (an extra $30 after buying a $220 stroller) on my City Mini, honestly.  It does the job well and I have it situated to where it doesn't swing when walking.  It easily holds a LOT of stuff and attaches even to the wide BJ handle.  I have no complaints, especially for the price!"
Baby,5.0,A Breastfeeding MUST,"If you are breastfeeding and using Avent bottles, these are a must! No longer do my bottles tip over and leak in between work and home. Plus you can stack the bottles in the fridge, so they take up less space. Also saves on the number of nipples you have to buy. I wish they were easier to find in my area, but thank goodness for amazon! :)"
Baby,4.0,Does the Job,This is a holder that works well. It adjusts to the weight of the cup well so there is no spilling when putting in fountain drinks. It stays put well also with the velcro straps. Pleased with the product and would reccomend.
Baby,5.0,wonderful mobile,I love the music and the sound level! the night light is great too. My daugther loved going to sleep with this. and to save on batteries you can just do the music and light without the mobile going at night.or just the music. It was easy to put together too.
Baby,4.0,Good option for stollers w/o a cupholder.,Holds a fair amount of stuff and is pretty sturdy for drinks.  For the $$ I am pleased with this purchase!
Baby,4.0,Great help for tummy time,"I bought this hoping it would help the little one enjoy tummy time more.  He hated being on his tummy and face planted whenever we tried.  Because he has a mild case of torticollis, the pediatrician emphasized how important tummy time was so he could strengthen and stretch his neck. This item has made tummy time easier on him and has help strength his neck quite a bit.  It's nice because he is up a little higher and is forced to lift his head.  The only draw back, which is noted in almost every review, is the fact that the mat doesn't stay put.  While on it, he will grab the toys or mat itself which will cause it to scrunch up.  Overall, I think it was a great buy since it's helped so much with his neck."
Baby,4.0,Dashboard,"we have an UppaBaby Vista which does not have come with a beverage holder. The UppaBaby branded one is over $20, which seems overpriced to me. I found this on amazon for under $10 and it has been a great buy. We use it to hold a water bottle, hand sanitizer, burp cloths, my wife's wallet, keys, etc. Very handy and improved on the one area that the Vista was lacking. People have actually come up to us in our local baby store and asked where we got it since they were also about to buy the Vista. Totally worth the price and very very useful. The velcro straps make it adjustable to just about any handle. Highly reccomend."
Baby,4.0,Exactly what you think it is!,"A cup for you, a cup for baby, wallet, keys and sunglasses in the middle.  What more could you ask for?"
Baby,4.0,Great Cup Holder,"I bought this cup holder for my Uppababy Vista stroller and I'm very happy with it.  The middle compartment holds my wallet, keys, cell phone, and occasionally I stuff in whatever toy baby is playing with.  The cup holders are great for water bottles and drink cups that have lids and straws.  I deducted 1 star because it is not very good for cups with coffee lids as it sways and causes spills on to the stroller.  I leave it attached to the stroller when I fold it.  I've also been able to hang the diaper bag from the stroller handle while the cup holder is attached."
Baby,5.0,very hand for lightweight stroller,I got this to go with the Britax light-weight stroller.  It is perfect and can stay attached even when I collapse the stroller.
Baby,5.0,"LOVE this for my double, just ordered a 2nd","We have a Baby Jogger City Mini double - love the stroller, hate that it doesn't come with even a cup holder - and I really didn't like the idea of spending a minimum of $30 for the one that they sell for it. It didn't get good reviews for use on the double stroller, but in one of the reviews this one was mentioned.<br /><br />It fits really well on my stroller, doesn't get in the way when I want to fold it up which I do after every use, holds up great and hasn't bent or anyting.  The velcro seems to be very secure, and doesn't pull tight so I don't expect any problems there.  I love that it has some structure to hold it's shape.  The zipper pocket is great for my cell phone - I stand it up in there, and when I'm done I usually leave change in it so I just zip it up so it doesn't get lost.<br /><br />The cup holders have been used for sippy cups, water bottles, travel mugs - all work well - the only thing that didn't was a 16oz paper coffee cup from the coffee shop - it wasn't easy to get in and out and the lid popped off on me...so I just use my travel mug - or get the 20 oz, haha.<br /><br />I just today ordered a second one to put on the other side of my stroller - since I have to use a double stroller I have the space, and often am walking with someone, so now I'll have space for grown up stuff, and kid stuff - they always have snacks and drinks too.<br /><br />A great product and an awesome price!"
Baby,5.0,great little organizer,"we purchased this little organizer to go on an umbrella stroller that doesn't have a basket.  It will hold 2 \\""route 44\\"" drinks from sonic, a sippy cup and a snack cup...all at once.  It could be left attached to a large stroller but you must undo one side of it when using with an umbrella type stroller.  over all a good product that fit the bill for us."
Baby,5.0,My Niece LOVES this thing!!,I bought this for my 2 month old niece and she loves it. She kicks her legs and arms and make those happy baby noises. I am glad I bought this for her. I love to see her happy. The music is very soothing as well.
Baby,5.0,Surprising gift,"We received this monkey binky Wubbanub as a gift when our daughter was born.  She was and still is not much of a binky user in general.  So early on we didn't use the monkey at all.  However, at around 4 months our daughter showedsigns of teething so o. A whim I gave her the monkey.  Now it is one of three favorites that we don't go anywhere without!!!  She uses it mostly to suck or chew when she is teething.  It is the perfect size for her to hold and manipulate to knaw on the binky or the monkey itself!  It was such a hit that I ordered two more but with different animals - kitty and pony.  The monkey has a but more weight than the other two and is still the favorite!  I order it for gifts now for others and it has always been a hit!"
Baby,1.0,Strap broke,"At first I thought it was great. Cheap, easy to use, holds a decent amount of stuff. But one of the straps broke after a few months and now it's useless."
Baby,2.0,My Grandson loves his Wubbanub monkey,My Grandson Cooper is never without his monkey pacifier....he is 3 months old but hangs on to his monkey pacifier.  It is so adorable and useful and his Mom loves it too because it doesn't land on the floor.
Baby,4.0,great addition to our city mini,"Our City Mini doesn't have any sort of tray or cup holders so this purchase was a must.  I have to say that for the price this cannot be beat.  We can bring a bottle of water (or 2), cell phone, keys, sunglasses, and still have room to put the dogs retractable leash in there too.  Great purchase!"
Baby,5.0,Stroller's should come with it!,"This was a great add on and works really well. I just wish I had paid attention to reviewers who said don't fold your stroller with it on, we bent the rim of the caddy the first time we used it but it bent back and still works great. The zip mesh pocket is a nice touch.<br /><br />It even works with our Joovy Kooper's split handles (it doesn't have one long straight rail) so if you are worried about it slipping on that kind of stroller it doesn't seem to have any problems on ours."
Baby,5.0,great travel mat,we have the deluxe activity mat and it is much much better but decided to buy this one for travel. Kept our twin boys entertained and doing tummy time but lacked some of the things we enjoy most about the deluxe version. the music is lame and no lights. Still good for the price but not if it's the only activity mat you plan to buy.
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub Pacifier,I've always gotten the wubbanub pacifiers but the monkey is by far my favorite.  The weight of the monkey helps keep it in an infants mouth and when they get older they can find them easily in the night.  Super great product and prompt delivery.
Baby,1.0,"all style, no substance","I went through two of these.  the first wouldn't snap closed securely from the moment I took it out of its packaging.  the replacement I received lasted a couple of short months before cracking and falling apart.  I don't think that qualifies it as an alternative to disposable, travel-wipes packages.  they amount to the same in landfill waste.  very disappointing."
Baby,4.0,"great organizer, but not so great cup holder...","I bought this buggy buddy because my Uppa Baby stroller did not come with a cup holder or a place to put my cell phone and keys.  It's a great organizer, but it does not hold cups that well.  First of all, your drinks can't be that tall because they won't fit.  They'll hit the stroller handle that the organizer is attached to.  Second of all, when a drink is in one of the cup holders, it off sets the balance in the organizer, and things spill out. So forget about putting a coffee in there!  But I do like it for things like my sunglasses, keys, cell phone, small snacks for baby, and small bottles."
Baby,5.0,Great with BOB stroller,"I had read a lot of reviews about the BOB stroller parent accessory tray being too shallow, and actually witnessed a water bottle topple out of the BOB tray onto a child's head. EEK! So when I was ordering my own BOB stroller, I knew that I had to find a different parent tray. This easily holds 2 750mL water bottles, a cell phone , camera, keys, and garage door opener, with room to spare. installs in less than 2 seconds sans directions, is sturdy and well designed. Would recommend to anyone, with any stroller type, hands down, a great product."
Baby,2.0,lasted a little over a month,"This was very useful to me for about a month and a half. It holds your coffee, keys, phone etc...  and it seemed pretty sturdy but the strap broke off. Even considering the cheap price this shouldn't have broke after only a month as i didn't put much weight at all in it."
Baby,5.0,Very peaceful,"Someone else mentioned that this was not loud enough. I have to admit I was surprised how \\""mellow\\"" the tunes were as mobiles we have had in the past have been much \\""brighter.\\"" However our little guy doesn't seem to complain & I LOVE the Rainforest \\""medley.\\"" I have found that if he wakes up a little too early for my liking & certainly way too early for music LOL! I can turn on the Rainforest & he will happily lie there looking at the animals going around & we can go back to sleep for those precious few more minutes. It's quiet enough not to disturb us but loud enough to keep him occupied."
Baby,1.0,"So cute, but can't replace paci!!","I bought one of these for our little guy since it was the same paci he had used at the hospital and it looked very cute. He really seemed to like it for the twelve hours we had it before my dog got a hold of the paci and chewed it (new mom, still learning:). To my dismay, you can't change out the paci...so you are stuck. Basically, you are paying for one REALLY expensive (albeit cute) pacifier. There are other brands out there that allow you to change out the pacifier. We returned this (excellent customer service) and bought a paci-plushi monkey and are very happy with it."
Baby,4.0,Very cute!,Well I purchased this as well as the Pacimals-monkey.I like the fact that both of these items is a lot easier to find in my son's crib then just the regular pacifier. But from both of these I prefer the wubbanub mostly because of the price I would have rated this product with 5 stars but I just don't like the fact that you cannot remove the pacifier from the monkey so it is always getting wet when I have to rinse it out.
Baby,5.0,wubbanub,Love the Wubbanub and so does my baby. When not in his mouth he likes to hold the monkey. I am planning on giving one to my pregnant friend.
Baby,2.0,Motor failed after a while,"My baby enjoyed this mobile. There was a period (when he was 2-3 months old) when he would stop crying and kick excitedly whenever we placed him in his crib and turned the mobile on. But after about 3 months of not-too-heavy use, the motor started making a whirring noise, and would struggle to turn. We replaced the batteries several times (which did not fix the problem), and decided to put up with the whirring noise and the slowness. It finally stopped turning at all after 6 months. I disassembled it, and found that it was cheap plastic construction, which relies on a thin rubber band to rotate the whole assembly. I cleaned the plasticky gunk from the belt-wheel (another plastic piece), but shortly after being reassembled, the mobile slowed down again. It's going in the trash."
Baby,5.0,Fabulous!,"My newborn is loving this pacifier! And so am I, since it never gets lost, easy to find in his crib and by using it I significantly reduced the number of trips to my son's crib throughout the night since the monkey weights down on baby's chest and does not fall out of his mouth as often as all other pacifiers. Originally I bought it because I thought it was cute but turns out it is very useful.<br /><br />My son can easily grab it with his hand to hold it near his mouth when taking a break. I simply love it and I recommended it to a bunch of friends and everyone seems very happy with it."
Baby,5.0,Love It,My son loves it. He did use it as a pacifier now he just likes to chew on it. Now that he has some of his motor skills he likes to grab it and put it to his mouth.
Baby,4.0,Great for my UppaBaby Vista 2010,"I searched high and low for a cupholder for my Uppababy Vista 2010, and I stumbled upon this one.  I read all the reviews on Amazon and I'm so glad that I purchased it.  It's less expensive then the cupholder that Uppababy offers, and it's so much nicer!  I love the fact that it can hold 2 drinks (one for me and one for my hubby- or later on, my baby's sippy cup!), and I like the storage compartment in the middle- great for putting snack, keys, cell phone, sunglasses, whatever!  It even has a small zippered compartment that's barely visible from the pictures.      Great product for the price.  Haven't had any problems with it.  I would give it 5 stars if there was a mechanism that would make it not sway when I'm going over some bumps or onto the sidewalk, but overall, I'm greatly satisfied."
Baby,5.0,Must Buy for New Parents,Bought this because our stroller does not have a tray or cup holder. This is one of the best things I ever bought and wish I had found it three years ago when we had our daughter. Fits cups of every size and has space for two with a zipper pocket for keys or cash. Good buy and very useful!
Baby,5.0,great item,I use this all the time when I store my milk in the refrigerator.  It does its job.
Baby,5.0,Awesome Mobile,"My baby was early and at the Children's Hospital, they use these in the nursery. I had already bought one for his crib and it was well worth it. Baby stares at it, on and off. He loves the music, which puts him to sleep every time. Diaper changes are easier with the mobile too. The hospital recommends it, I recommend it. SUCH A GREAT BUY!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for UPPA baby Vista Stroller,"I have an UPPA Baby Vista stroller and I did not want to purchase their 24 dollar cup holder. So I found this and decided to try it. I LOVE it. It's exactly what I needed. The handle bars on the Vista are at an angle and when you attach this it sits perfectly level. I have not had a problem with it tipping over when full...even when I have 1 drink/bottle it. I love that it has a zipper pocket. The center compartment is perfect for keys, cell phone and a wallet. It says it is insulated....and it is but very lightly and only on one side but I'm ok with that. I don't even have to remove it when I collapse the stroller! It doesn't interfere with anything."
Baby,5.0,PERFECT!!!,"this is the best cup holder/console i have seen out there. i've been looking for a better one and still haven't found it. it fits perfectly on my baby jogger city mini and valco trimode. it holds my keys, blackberry, coffee, sippy cups and much more."
Baby,5.0,Best mobile out there,"This was the third mobile we tried for our daughter, and she is now almost 3  and still uses the music box part on her twin bed. The first mobile we bought was the wind up kind (silly new mom i was...) and i soon realized that only lasted 30 seconds. The music with this lasts about 20 minutes, and by six months my daughter was pushing the buttons herself to re-start the music. We also tried a battery mobile with plastic pieces that slid around and woke her up - mistake - this one is quiet, soothing and just perfect."
Baby,5.0,Very cute and works like a charm,"After reading all the fabulous reviews for this product, I could hardly wait to get one for my son and once it arrived, it didn't disappoint.    The entire mobile is colorful and the animals are very cute. It has a good selection of music, or you can choose to just play nature sounds. You can also select from a variety of options with the mobile itself -- light and movement, no light, volume, etc.     We put our son to bed every night with this and it has yet to fail."
Baby,5.0,Loooove It!,"I purchased this and the JL Childress Bottles and Bags organizer. I kept this and returned the other immediately. This holds water bottles, large reusable bottles and fast food style cups easily. The sraps are adjustable making it easy to tighten to hold heavier items. The open space in the middle can hold more drinks or keys, cellphone, etc. and the zippered pocket in the rear is also a great feature. We have a the Peg Perego Aria twin and use this just on one side, and it doesn't get in the way when opening and folding the stroller (trust me we just came back from Disney). Plus, you can't beat the price! Great purchase."
Baby,5.0,Works on my Bumbleride...,"This is well worth it for the price.  I really like the cupholders, the big middle area and the zippered pocket.  It straps on well to my Bumbleride Indie (one cup holder just wasn't enough - I realized at the water park last week).  I had a number of options, read the reviews on this one and SO glad I got the cheapest - it is really made well - how refreshing when lots of these baby companies seem to try to gouge us new parents."
Baby,5.0,Stroller Accessory,"The is a low cost cup holder for any stroller. It is flexible and you can put other stuff in the middle: like phones, pacifiers, & keys. A great buy for a dad that brings to many things."
Baby,5.0,Holds a LOT!,"I first purchased a \\""fancy\\"" travel wipes holder and spent more than you'd like to know on it. In the end, it didn't hold enough wipes for a day's poops, and made everything it touched in my diaper bag wet from the wipes (it leaked). Then I smartened-up and purchased this Skip Hop travel wipes case, what a difference!!!  It holds more than double the amount of wipes than my old case, and does not leak! It's very easy to use with one hand, and best of all, you can attach it right to your stroller and use your wipes for spills and messes without digging through your diaper bag! I wish I had bought this item in the first place."
Baby,5.0,Great for preemie,My little guy LOVES this pacifier.  He's just learning to suck and gets frustrated when his paci falls out and this helps him keep it in! Great product!
Baby,4.0,Daughter's choice,"This is the first toy that my daughter grabbed and liked. I sort of had to get it at that point. It's really cute, we named him 'Ruffles' because he has ridges on his belly. The only cons about this toy is the ring at the back of his neck is starting to come un-stitched and secondly, this toy is not washable in the washing machine, it's damp cloth wash only. That doesn't exactly help when your daughter projectile vomits up 8oz of formula all over the toy. The felt just doesn't look the same. Overall I'm happy with it because my daughter loves it."
Baby,5.0,Great!,Great product.  Its sturdy and holds up big heavy drinks.  Fits perfect in my baby jogger city mini stroller and works very well.  Price is right and I love it.
Baby,4.0,Awesome for an umbrella stroller,"I love this handlebar console. Its pretty much compatible with every one of my strollers (all single strollers)It is sturdy and holds up great with 2 coffees on the sides and wallet, phone and keys in the middle. When folding the strollers, it is not in the way and can be folded flat while still attached. The only problem I had with one of them was that the sewn part on one of the sides came undone. But that was an easy fix!"
Baby,5.0,GREAT IDEA,JUST PURCHASED A LIGHTWEIGHT STROLLER FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND THIS CAME IN SO HANDY TO CARRY DRINKS OR A BOTTLE!  RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS ADDED CARRY SPACE.
Baby,4.0,Great add on.,"I didn't think when I bought my umbrella stroller to look for cup holders (first time mom) so I was so annoyed anytime we went to the mall or an attraction, you know you always have a drink, and this item is good for drinks, sippy cups, and other things, like your cell phone or a camera, that you just want easy quick access to."
Baby,4.0,Probably great for most strollers,"I have a Phil & Ted's Dash stroller which has a funky brake system.  You have to move the push/handle bar to its lowest position to engage the stroller's brakes.  Of course when doing so, it means that this product is angled to a ~45 degree pitch -- so if you have a drink in the holder, it may spill (potentially hot coffee on the baby right below).  Product could be improved upon if instead of straight velcro attachments on the sides, if there was a swivel mechanism allowing for any angle attachment and the product would stay level.  I'm sure it works fine on most strollers though - as most don't have this handle bar braking system."
Baby,4.0,Very helpful,"I bought this to put on my Graco Ipo umbrella stroller and it fits great. It attached easily with 2 velcros and stays on tight. It does tip forward and backward a bit though so an open cup would probably spill. Made of good quality fabric and holds quite a bit. I do have to undo one of the velcros to fold up the stroller, but that's no big deal. Happy to have a place to put my drink while we stroll!"
Baby,4.0,Gets the job done,"I love my European stroller, but it doesn't have cup holders.  And when we go to the zoo, a giant soda is absolutely necessary to keep fueled for lots of hilly stroller pushing. I had high hopes when I ordered the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, and it gets the job done, at least for my needs.  It has enough room to hold my cell phone, small wallet, and giant soda.  It's not overly sturdy so I wouldn't advise two large adult drinks.  It can handle a sippy cup/bottle and a adult drink (but your wallet will need to be moved), and that's fine by me.  On the off chance my husband comes with us to the zoo, he can carry his own cup."
Baby,5.0,Very please,The buggy buddy has been a life saver!  We use it on our Britax light stroller.  It holds all the essentials while not being too big and bulky.  The velcro straps are adjustable and the cup holders can hold a large drink snuggly.  If your drink gives off condensation then the liquid will pool in the bottom of the bag.  I would buy this product many times over and would consider it for giving as a gift.
Baby,5.0,Favorite Pacifier,I bought this for my grandson and he does not like any of his other pacifiers now.  It is great because it doesn't fall on the floor as rapidly as other ones and he can hold onto it like a favorite stuffed animal!  Saw it on the Today show and had to have one! Soo cute too.
Baby,4.0,Cute,"i love this binkie! my 4 month old looooves it. it helps keep the bink in when shes kinda falling asleep. the only problem with it is, when shes awake, she plays with the monley part and keeps pulling it out of her mouth. but she loves the monkey so im SO happy we bought it :)"
Baby,5.0,One of the best purchases for your stroller,"I have to say I didn't think something so small could be so useful, but it really is nice to have small items at your fingertips and there is no need for an additional water bottle holder that sticks out and bumps into things - this accessory is great I highly recommend it!"
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub is awesome,My son loves his monkey Wubbanub.  It is not only cute but functional.  He has done best with this versus a standard pacifier.
Baby,5.0,"A ""Must Have"" For Your Stroller","The Buggy Buddy parent console is a must have for your stroller. It's perfect for trips to the zoo, amusement park, mall, wherever.  The drink holders held my 20 oz. bottles of water wonderfully. And the middle part is great for your camera, cell phone, sunglasses, etc. The velcro straps are long enough to accommodate different stroller widths. I use this on my BabyJogger City Series single (2007) and it works perfectly, as the handles adjust to an angle that will hold the parent console level. I also have a Maclaren Volo and it works well with that one, too. However, if you load the console with too much stuff, the stroller (any umbrella stroller) will tip backwards. The only improvement I would make is that they add a swivel mechanism so that the parent console automatically levels itself, no matter the angle of your stroller handlebars. Small improvement aside, I would totally recommend this product!"
Baby,3.0,"It s OK, could be LOUDER!","I just got this \\""musical\\"" mobile for my son, it was a gift...(cant complain about that)because it complemented my rainforest theme....but its pretty low on volume, it s not the batteries cause they re brand new..i guess the volume only goes that high..the room has to be completely quiet to barely be able to hear the tunes....i thought it would do more like blink a light but no, all it does is flap the leaves really slow as it sloooooooooowly circles around the little critters...even the \\""light\\"" is barely visible..anyway..i think it could have been better. Overall i give it a 3 star cause its ok, not worth the 35 dollars, 15-20 dollars might have been more appropiate."
Baby,5.0,loooove it!!!,this thing is awesome!! my 3 month old son adores the mobile and the music is very soothing!!! love the remote too!!
Baby,3.0,Not the best,"This case works well, but the wipes dry out quickly. Not a problem if you only carry a few with you, and can remember to refill the case constantly."
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,"I absolutely love this product.  Fits on my umbrella stroller perfectly and I used it religiously.  Can't speak highly enough about it.  Get it, you won't regret it."
Baby,5.0,Love this mobile,I bought this mobile when my son was 4 months old.  He loved it then and loves it now. He is now 8 months.  He is entertained for a good 15-20 minutes. When you need that time to get ready or clean quickly this is a life saver. I am glad I bought. Worth the price. I highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful pacifier and so cute!,"My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him. He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his \\""wubbas\\"" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.    The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable. I highly recommend Wubbanubs!"
Baby,5.0,Great!,"My son has loved his Soothies since the day he was born but always had trouble keeping them in his mouth; dropping them and such.  I bought a Soothie Pacifier holder (the honey pot one) but that item failed us.  Soon after I ordered this Wubbanub (my son's first nick name was 'Monkey') at 3 months and even at 6 months old, he LOVES it and uses it as 'security blanket', if you will.  He plays with it and it's very easy for him to hold on to and put in his mouth on his own.  He also gets TONS of compliments on it! It's good to the both of us.  I definitely suggest this product to all mamas!<br /><br />EDIT: My son is now nearly 2 years old. We weened him off this pacifier (THE ONLY ONE HE WOULD USE) at about 12 months by cutting the Soothie out of the Monkey mouth and sewing the mouth shut. He was \\""so over\\"" his paci after only 2 nights and now, he and the monkey are inseparable at bed time."
Baby,2.0,Not so great on MACCLAREN...,"Thought this would be great after seeing on at the zoo, but is gets crumpled up and in the way when folding the stroller...    Update JAn 2011.  It is still sitting in the garage unused.  It looked great on other strollers, but not so great on the Quest."
Baby,1.0,shipping outrageous,I was about to order this when I realized they were charging me $35 to ship this to Hawaii!!!!!!  What a rip off!
Baby,5.0,Love it! Fits different strollers wonderfully.,"I bought this to use on a Sit & Stand stroller I have that didn't come with a cup holder, and with my umbrella stroller. It fits both easily, and the velcro straps are strong and easily adjustable. Wonderful product that solved a big problem for me!"
Baby,5.0,Cute toy,"Such a fun toy.  The colors are bright and fun, and I love the fact that it \\""roars.\\""  It was one of the first toys to really catch my sons attention."
Baby,4.0,Good Purchase,The rain forest mobile works well for the cost. It was easy to put together. There are times when the animals don't move right away and you have to push them to move. This could be the batteries I purchased or the actual device. The music and noises work well. Overall I would recommend this product to others.
Baby,4.0,"Very entertaining, wish it fit better","I love all the features of this mobile. The green leaves go up and down as it spins, the main panel lights up, and there are four different choices for song/sounds. I like that it's battery powered. My older son's mobile required cranking, and only stayed on for about 3 minutes. I also like that you can turn it on by remote, maybe giving yourself a few more minutes before the baby sees you and wants out!     The only negative so far is that it doesn't fit well on our crib. We have a sleigh-style crib, and it won't fit on any curved surface. I had to put it on the front rail (straight), but ours is pretty thick, so the clamp can't fit fully around the rail. It is on there, but not as well as it should be. It also pitches forward sort of awkwardly because it's not clamped right."
Baby,5.0,Fits a Maclaren Techno XLR Stroller,"This cup holder fits our Maclaren Techno XLR stroller quite well.  The two drink holders are stretchy enough to hold cans, water bottles, and the types of paper cups provided by quick service restaurants.  The loops used to connect it to the stroller fit very well on the extended posts of the adjustable handles. The bump created where the handle branches provides an excellent stop for the bag and so it stays very steady and even.  Drinks do not tip and we have had no problems with stability when we take three mile hikes over slanted and rocky sidewalks.    The center section has been a wonderful repository for my pepper spray, cell phone, and MP3 player.  The zippered portion is very slim, and best suited to very thin items. The Buggy Buddy slightly impedes use of the top storage bag on the back of the Techno XLR's hood, but does not fully block access to the small covered pouch.  I feel the small frustration is a small price to pay for two cup holders and additional easy access storage.    When we collapse the stroller I undo one of the connecting straps but leave the other connected to the stroller, this allows the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy to stay with the stroller but without stressing the wire structure.  While I can close the stroller with the Buggy Buddy fully connnected, I have read that others have bent or broken the super-structure of the Buggy Buddy and so this seems a nice compromise.  I keep everything in one place, it takes only a moment to put on and off, and I am am decreasing the risk of damaging the Buggy Buddy.    Update April 2011: Wire superstructure broke. Forgot to lift loop off of the handle before folding stroller. Still somewhat functional, but sharp ends necessitate removal from stroller. I wish they would re-design product with a less fragile structural element.    The quality of the product is higher than I expected and it seems sturdier than other higher priced stroller accessories I have purchased.  We are about to take it on two crosscountry flights and a fourteen night stay at Disney World.  So,in the next month it will tackle toddlers, teenagers, heat, rain, flight crews, trains, buses, and boats.  If anything breaks or has problems I will update this account.  If you are reading this after October 1, 2010 and there is no update then rest assured that no news is good news and the Buggy Buddy exceeded expectations and survived the wild adventure to Walt Disney World unscathed."
Baby,4.0,Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"Ok. There are MORE pros than cons for this wipes case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. you can attach it to stroller or outside of diaper bag.<br />2. it's made of much harder plastic than the cheap travel wipes cases that come free in the box when you buy diapers in bulk.<br />3. you can really open it with one hand, allowing your other hand to be holding baby.<br />4. easier to remove wipes than it is from those cheap travel cases (mentioned above in #2)<br />4. holds WAY more wipes than those cheap travel cases do<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The case snaps shut but tends to open on its own too easily. Example: I was walking and only holding the case by the black strap so it was swinging with my arm motion. The case popped WIDE open and all my wipes fell into the dirt (we were camping)! LAME-OLA. But in the case's defense, i did have it chuck full of wipes. so it could have been the sheer weight of the wipes that made the case open up. nevertheless, now I am \\""scared\\"" to hook it onto the outside of things bc i am scared the wipes will all fall out.<br />2.  Easy for a toddler to pull off the red button, but it does snap back on. Just make sure you put it back on the right way b/c one side of the button is raised higher than the other to aid your thumb when trying to push it open with one hand."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what we needed,"We recently purchased a Tike Tech Single City X3 stroller, which has no easily accessible storage, especially for small items like car keys and wallets. But given that my husband and I are complete coffee addicts, the main reason I bought the Buggy Buddy was the cupholders. I hoped against hope that the cupholders would accommodate cups of iced and hot coffee and hold them securely enough to prevent spilling, but I fully expected to be disappointed. Much to my surprise, the Buggy Buddy worked exactly the way I hoped it would. It attaches very securely to the stroller, and even with two heavy drinks in it, the Buggy Buddy doesn't tip. The storage area between the cupholders is the ideal size for all those small items you don't want in your pockets. We're able to collapse the stroller without detaching the Buggy Buddy, and so far, the BB hasn't sustained any damage. This is an extremely well-made item for the price. It has met our needs perfectly."
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller Caddy,"I bought this because I read a good review on here about the use of this item with the UPPA Baby Vista stroller. This item is exactly what the stroller is lacking! I love the roominess of the pouch, the zippered pocket, and the two spaces for cups. The cup holders are stretchy neoprene which fits virtually any cup and holds it in place. Also, when moving the stroller in various positions, the caddy freely swings which prevents spilling your drink and items out of the center part of the organizer. Just the right size and seems to be well-made! Great product and comparably cheap too!"
Baby,1.0,I am only giving 1 star because it doesnt work,We ordered this one because our son loves the swing. We just put it together and the sound and light do not work
Baby,1.0,Wasted money,"I'll make this review to-the-point. Reasons to NOT waste your money on this:    1. It is exremely big and bulky, bigger than the actual wipes from the package. It literally takes up 30% of my diaper bag.  2. The red button pops off if you use to much pressure  3. The wipes dry out very quickly    I use the travel wipes from Target - cost less than a dollar, more in the package, no need to transfer, more compact and they stay moist!"
Baby,4.0,Works fine,I bought this for my daughter to use on her umbrella stroller and it works as described.
Baby,2.0,Don't purchase this if you have an unbrella stroller.,"If you order the Sunshine Kids Accessory Buggy be prepared for the following:    ** It doesn't fold with your umbrella stroller.  It has a strong wire around the top of it which requires you to manually dismantle one side if you are folding your stroller.  If you are checking your umbrella stroller in at the airport, then you would have to completely remove it.  This may not be a big deal for some, but for me it was a deal breaker.  I want ease of use at all times when dealing with a toddler, getting the stroller in and out of my car a few times a day, and definitely not something to deal with at the airport.  I sent mine back once I discovered it's inabilty to fold and got the Maclaren Universal Organizer.  I am more than satisfied."
Baby,1.0,Not a fan,"This case looks good, but is bigger than all of the other cases I have and too bulky for my diaper bag. It's difficult to use with one hand as the slider is hard to open and the wipes are very hard to pull out. Will keep to use as a spare around the house, but would not recommend this."
Baby,1.0,Big waste of money,"I was so disappointed with this product, the red closure does NOT provide an airtight seal, so within a couple days all the wipes were dried out and useless.  The reviews I had read before purchasing seemed to praise it, and I was looking for a way to take just a few wipes with me vs a whole pack -- but this was a big waste of money.  DONT buy it!!"
Baby,5.0,Lamaze Early Development Toys Are FANTASTIC!,"I first purchased the Lamaze Mortimer the Moose for my nephew. He absolutely loves Mortie, as we call him, so I ordered Sir Prance A-Lot to have at my house for him to play with. Like Mortie, Sir Prance A-Lot is visually stimulating with many different textures and patterns that my nephew enjoys. The tail rings are great for teething, though he does seem to like chewing on the feet of Sir Prance A-Lot. The squeak element in Sir Prance A-Lot's knight always draws his attention. And you can dangle Sir Prance A-Lot above him for long periods of time, the moving feet and the sound of the bell ringing seem endlessly fascinating to my nephew.    Because of my nephew's response to Mortie Moose and Sir Prance A-Lot toys my sister-in-law ordered the Lamaze Early Development Toy Olivia the Owl for my nephew to have at his grandparents house. Basically we love the Lamaze Early Development Toys and cannot recommend them enough. Every child should have at least one. Or three."
Baby,5.0,love it,"My son is 3 months old and he can watch this mobile for hours.  It's bright and colorful, i like the selection of music.  It has the right volume for a baby. I even catch myself watching at it sometimes and it comes with a remote so you can stand outside the room to start it up. Love it!!!!"
Baby,5.0,Great product!,This stroller accessory works on my pet stroller and is great for holding my smaller items and drinks! Easy to attach and strong velcro fastenings hold it in place.
Baby,4.0,Colourful,"Bought this for a present to a baby. Well packaged, so it will still be in that packaging when I wrap it. Nice and bright just as in photo.  I like it."
Baby,5.0,Love This! Goes Well With My Combi Stroller,This works well with my Combi Stroller.  It keeps it shape and holds Venti size Starbucks cups just fine.  The velcro is quite large so it can adjust nicely.  I would recommend this.
Baby,4.0,Cute mobile,The mobile is very bright and the leaves move which I think will entertain our son once he is born.
Baby,5.0,inexpensive mobile that works,Love the product.  didn't expect how beautiful it is until my husband assembled it.  Love the different music and the moving animals and most of all we love how it automatically turns off after 15 mins to save battery or in case you fell asleep.
Baby,4.0,Eddie take him or leave him,"My daughter had zero interest in Eddie. For her his songs were too short and his buttons were much to hard to press (and still are at 2 years old).    My son (5 months) is really interested in him. He loves to chew on his ears and play with the crinkle feet. He's always surprised when I push the music button.    As a parent I have mixed feelings about Eddie.  Negatives:  - buttons are much too hard for little ones to push  - songs are really short  - record function is too short  - battery box sticks out a little creating a hard surface on the back  Positives:  - bright and colorful, catches babies eye  - crinkle feet (always fun)  - fun music"
Baby,4.0,A little quiet but my son  loves it!,"My three month old loves this mobile! There are two volumes but neither are very loud, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  It was easy to assemble and the remote feature is awesome!"
Baby,2.0,Musical toy that can only be operated by adults,"I bought this wanting something that my baby could use to make musical sounds. Unfortunately, it is useless for this purpose. The buttons to make music are so difficult to press that even I have problems with it. My baby is very frustrated with it, as she knows that it should make music (she's seen me press the buttons) but she can't figure out how to make it work herself. So for her, this is just a stuffed animal. While it's price would be fine if she could actually work it, it's very overpriced for a stuffed elephant. I love my other Lamaze toys, but this one is disappointing."
Baby,5.0,Excellent Mobile,This mobile works great.  Both the music and the bright colorful animals get and hold our son's attention and he still enjoys it after 9 months.  We used any combination of the three songs whenever he would go down for a nap during the day and the 'Rainforest' sounds whenever we put him to bed for the night.  Just one more thing we did to help him differentiate night time from nap time.<br /><br />We ended up barely ever using the remote as most of the time our son would fall asleep before the time limit on the music would end but it was nice to have at the beginning when he would occasionally take longer to get to sleep.<br /><br />Even though he stands up in his crib now and pushes the button on/off this is still securely fastened enough that we don't worry about him getting it off his crib.
Baby,3.0,Wish the pacifier was removable,"Great idea, but I would like to have the option to remove the pacifier to clean it or switch out."
Baby,2.0,Disappointed for lack of info,"Kinda disappointed and thought this can be used for my daughters Graco Crib. Turns out that this device can be used for a wooden crib. So, beware."
Baby,4.0,"Great, BUT you need a flat surface on crib to hang...","Just received this mobile, but since my baby's crib has a curved design (on the back and the sides) I couldn't install it there...had to install in the front where it is flat for the mobile to \\""sit\\"" on..which is kind of inconvenient..."
Baby,5.0,I love this product. I want to marry it.,"After crashing through three weeks of motherhood like a wild boar, I realized dimly in my sleep-deprived state, that I owned this mobile.  It was placed on my registry as an afterthought, urged by overzealous parenting magazines and bolstered by good reviews.  Though it didn't fit my crib, I affixed it to the back of a dining room chair.  As I write this review, I listen to my baby sleeping peacefully after listening to a round of Mozart. I feel like shaking the baby monitor to see if it is broken. Four days ago I told my husband, \\""if this isn't a fluke, I swear, I am going to write the best product review ever.\\""  This is what I could muster without mentioning promising sex acts to the product makers."
Baby,5.0,His second favorite toy!....,"Our son really likes Sir Prance A Lot. We got him Jaques the Peacock first and it was with that toy that he learned to reach for things and hold on to them, I didn't know how he'd be with Sir Prance A Lot...but luckily he loves him! He really enjoys yanking on the legs as they all make a crumbling noise. This toy is very well made and colorful enough to hold my baby's attention. He's had the toy since he was 2 months, he's now going on 6 months and he's just as fascinated!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome stroller organizer :),This is the best stroller addition -- I have a Peg Perego Pliko P3 and love the stroller but wanted a drink holder for 2 or more drinks.  The Buggy Buddy has met every need and I'm thrilled!  It fits the Pliko very nicely and I can even fold the Pliko up with the Buggy Buddy attached -- can't get easier than that.  It holds 2 drinks in the holders and then I can normally fit at least one or 2 more drinks (I have 3 kids :) in the middle section --plus keys and a small snack or two.  It's truly great would recommend it to anyone looking for a drink holder for the Pliko and other strollers.
Baby,5.0,"Works fine - it's a 6-pack, though","Works just fine, and makes these bottles quite versatile.  When the child is younger, you can use the larger bottles to carry extra water, and when they're older, you can use the smaller bottles to carry food.<br /><br />As for the description -- as of this writing, the description on amazon.com neglects to mention that this is a 6-pack, and the only stock image provided shows 2 discs.  Make sure you're aware of this before you end up with too many discs.  ;)<br /><br />EDIT: A friend just purchased too many, thinking that there were only 2 discs.  I'm going to attach a photo showing 6 discs."
Baby,2.0,Not worth it!,I purchased this for my son when he was three months. It never worked only made sound if you press the buttons very hard. My baby never plays with this teether he enjoys the old fashion keys. I figure simple is better.
Baby,5.0,Great for Wheelchairs,"This tough holder fits either on the back or side of my wheelchair.  Folds flat for transfer to carry on for air trave. Heavy vlecro secure enough to hold 2 bottles of water and lots of junk during bumpy trip around Harry Potter attraction at Universal,also held additional weight of umbrella and hat."
Baby,5.0,Great for entertaining or sleeping.,"Our baby LOVED his wind-up mobile, but the music didn't last long enough for us to get anything done or for him to stay happy! So we searched for a longer-lasting, remote-controlled one. This mobile is cute, albeit it doesn't match his room decor, and it is bright and engaging. Our 4 1/2 mo old loves to watch the leaves (they go up and down around the animals as they rotate). It was easy to install and I like the fact that it uses D batteries, so hopefully they last quite awhile. We don't usually turn the actual unit off, so it can be operated by the remote control any time. Overall we really like it for its length of operation, its design and its ability to entertain baby. I have a few minor caveats: The remote doesn't work from too far away; the sensor on the main body has to be visible to the sensor on the remote (no operating from behind the door or around the corner). The second is the music. Though it is calming and classical and largely not annoying, it is midi music, and I wish it were real symphonic music. At this point, baby doesn't seem to mind but it does bother me a bit. Lastly, I wish the music would fade instead of turning off at the timer. Sometimes if he is almost asleep the abrupt change in sound will cause him to stir or wake up. Maybe he's just sensitive though...Overall it was a great purchase for the price and we use it very often."
Baby,5.0,My infant LOVES IT!,"We got this mobile for our 3 month old and he loves it.  We have had it now for a month and it really settles him down and helped transition him to being able to get himself to sleep.  We were a little worried about the sounds level being too low after reading other reviews but the sound is great.  I personally would not want it to go any louder, especially since most of the time we are using we are trying to settle him down, not stimulate him.  I would highly recommend this mobile."
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT,My family loves the wubbanub. Both of my sons used them as pacis and loveys. We can't recommend this product enough.
Baby,5.0,Works great with a Baby Jogger City Mini stroller...,"I bought this item a few days ago, and I am very happy with it.  I have it attached to the handle of my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller.  I can leave it attached all of the time, as it does not impede the fold of the stroller.    We took a trip to the zoo yesterday, and I loaded it up with:  Smart phone in the small mesh zipper pocket (this would also be a good area for a small wallet).  27 oz Klean Kanteen bottle in one of the drink holders.  Sunglasses in the other drink holder (another Klean Kanteen bottle would have fit however).  Medium size camera, small bag of cookies, and a zoo map in the main compartment...with some room left to spare.    The velcro straps are very strong.  I thought they would sag under the weight of my fully filled Klean Kanteen bottle, but they did not.  The product appears to very well made, especially considering the low price.  My only small complaint is that the Sunshine Kids logo is a bit cheesy looking.  I might try turning it around so it faces the rear of the stroller and can't be seen."
Baby,5.0,Perfect! Exactly what I always needed!,This Cup holder/organizer is great! I use it with a baby jogger city select and it looks great and works superbly. We spend a lot of time strolling about the town and going to my favorite coffee place to get iced coffees and this holder accommodates 2 larges with ease and I can still fit my phone and wallet in between!
Baby,5.0,works GREAT with uppababy!,"I have the Uppababy Vista stroller and i bought this cup holder last year. IT IS AMAZING! Last year i went for walks every single day with my newborn and it held my coffee steady each time! (of course, most places dont have the best covers for the coffee so there were a few drips.. but not this cup holders fault!)Even though the Uppababy has slanted handlebars it still holds the drinks upright and very securely! I have bumped into it many many times and i have NEVER had a cup or bottle fall out. It moves up and down the handlebars very smoothly. I have carried up to 3 coffees and a baby bottle and it has never even had a rip in the material let alone have it break like some other reviewers had! I figured for the price i couldnt go wrong to give it a shot but it would have been worth it even if it was even more $$!! Aside from cups, it holds my keys, my phone, pacifiers, bottles, snacks, misc things that need to be put down 'NOW'...    Overall i HIGHLY recommend this cupholder for the Uppababy Vista!!!"
Baby,3.0,Not as good as hoped,"I  bought this play mat on a whim but now wish i had done some research first.  I find the mat itself is way to narrow and thin.  I always worry  about my son rolling onto the plastic base on either side and hurting his head or face so i end up using a folded blanket over top which sort of defeats the purpose of a \\""mat\\"".  He seems to really enjoy the toys though and i like the fact that everything is interchangeable which helps keep him entertained.  He also fell in lOVE with the giraffe and plays with it off of the mat which is one of the main reasons i haven't sold it.  If i could re-do my purchase I would go with the  Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies & Lights Deluxe Gym, it seems like the much better version of this one."
Baby,4.0,Best purchase!,"Read the reviews and decided to buy this. It is amazing. From the moment I put it up and turned it on he has loved it. It's great because I can put him in his crib and he is fascinated with it for about and hour, giving me time to do some things around the house. It was also pivotal in getting him used to/comfortable with his crib. That way when we moved him from his bassinet to the crib, the transition was smooth. Also note, the music isn't annoying at all. However, I wish it stayed on longer than 30 minutes and that the remote did not deactivate after an hour. Otherwise a great buy."
Baby,3.0,Decent product but not worth the high ratings so far,"This crib mobile definitely attracts our baby's attention and helps him relax and sleep often.   Pros:   - Decent value for the money.   - colorful and attractive  - Easy assembly and installation  Cons:   - Not loud enough in the rainforest mode  - All tunes are dull and sleep inducing. At least one of them could have been a bit peppy  - Requires 3 D Type batteries. That's way too much. (At least it hasn't required replacement so far)   - The lights are not visible unless the room is completely dark  - It will play for 18 minutes and then stop. It's neither continuous nor customizable  - Our baby stopped watching it after 2 months. May not be useful after 4 months     Given a choice, I'd give 3.5 stars. Sells at a premium because of the brand and new parents' anxiety.   Planning to sell it on amazon marketplace or ebay, since it was used only for 2 months"
Baby,1.0,Would not buy this ever again. If you drop it everything comes out.,I dropped the case a few times and if it land on the sides the whole thing pops out and everything either falls out or partial fall out.
Baby,5.0,Great removable parent tray,"We use this parent tray with different strollers. We first purchased this to avoid using the 2 lbs Jeep parent tray, which cannot hold cups & sport bottles."
Baby,5.0,Works great with my Uppa baby vista too!,"Big thanks to the parent that posted the review for this item as an accessory to their Uppa Baby Vista.  I tried several items, and this was by far the best fit.  It doesn't have a huge amount of space, but it is enough for a 3/4 liter camelbak bottle (fits well and can be removed and replaced with one hand with a little practice!), a sippy cup or bottle for my son, a cell phone, keys and a small wallet.  It is also sturdy enough that I wouldn't worry about a cup of tea in a travel cup spilling - that was my biggest concern.  I assumed that it would swing back and forth throughout our walks (I walk at least 3 miles with my son every day), but it is really very sturdy when it is weighted down with our gear.  There's even a small compartment for stashing a bit of cash/change as needed.  For $10, it is exactly what we needed.    For those who want something flashier, the Baby Jogger Parent Console with build in mp3 player also worked well on the Uppa Baby and was an easier fit for the camelbak (no learning curve on how to get it in and out with one hand), but for $50, the unnecessary additional of the mp3 speakers wasn't worth it to me (and it seemed somewhat obnoxious to boot!)."
Baby,5.0,Great accessory for both my strollers,I bought this to add more cupholders to my travel system stroller and to add cupholders to my wave stroller which doesnt have any. They are insulated and waterproof from the center pocket. Sturdy material. Great addition.
Baby,5.0,Works perfect!,"I bought this to use with my Baby Jogger City Mini that doesn't have any sort of cup holder or parent compartment. When I was looking at a parent compartment to add, I really didn't want to spend a whole lot of money, and didn't like the cost/design of the parent console sold by Baby Jogger so I bought this one. My one and only hesitation in buying this was that it attaches by velcro and we all know that velcro can fail over time. I have not had this problem with this at all. I put this on my Baby Jogger City Mini when it came in, and have removed it several times to use on a Graco Mosaic stroller. The velcro is awesome and I've never worried about it coming off either stroller. I just wrapped it tightly around, and it's snug as can be. I use the \\""buggy buddy\\"" all the time for drinks of all sizes, keys, little toys, etc. Works great and will buy another one if I ever need more than the one I have now."
Baby,5.0,buggy buddy,I simply love it! Just got it today and it is roomie and very durable! cant wait to start to use it!
Baby,5.0,The Best,I love this Wubbanub. I would love to have all the different ones. It's the best thing for a baby. Mom's will love you for this gift. Always good to have several around.[[ASIN:B0028IDXDS Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey]]
Baby,3.0,plush pacifier,"Cute plush animal. Pacifier is sewn into the mouth of the stuffed animal. I have concerns about how this is to be kept clean as pacifer can not be removed and in turn certainly not boiled for sanitation. This item did not arrive to me in a sealed package, the bottom of package had be cut open entirely and not even taped closed. I give it 3 stars as it its cute, the pacifiers are great and it would make a great baby shower gift...is it practical? No Way. would I buy it again...no, i'd make my own from a beanie baby, it'd be cheaper and easier to wash."
Baby,4.0,Great for The Uppa Baby Stroller.,"Great product for my Uppababy Stroller. I can fit my baby's bottles, my keys, small wipes, and cell phone in this carrier. My only wish is that coffee or larger drinks fit in the cup holder.  Due to the way I have to attach it to my stroller it only holds can size drinks and up to 6oz bottles. But I am very happy with this product. Well worth the low cost."
Baby,4.0,Love it!,This is an answer to my prayers.  I wish the stuffed animal was a little heavier to stay in place on my babies chest.  The soothie paci is sewn to the animal so once it wears out you'll need to buy another one.  I thought the stuffed animal clipped onto the paci.  But I still love it!
Baby,5.0,An excellent baby toy,"I bought this for my nephew who is 4 months old and is really starting to like grabbing and playing with toys.  Covered in bright, captivating colors and a variety of fun textures, it is about 8 inches across, so it's not too large or overwhelming for the baby to maneuver around.<br /><br />Sir Prance A Lot (the knight) has a squeaker inside his head and is covered in a soft, fuzzy blue and green polyester fabric.  There is also a clip on top of his head so that the toy can be attached to a stroller or car seat.  The horse is mostly covered in a shinier, more satin-like fabric.  There are also ribbon \\""tags\\"" for his mane and lining the edge of the \\""blanket\\"" underneath his saddle.  The crinkle material that my nephew loves so much is located in the hooves and under the saddle blanket, and there is a bell inside the horse's head.  Two plastic rings make up the tail of Sir Prance A Lot's horse.<br /><br />It arrived in a sealed plastic bag, so it was well protected from the rain and snow."
Baby,5.0,My baby LOVE all the Avent Product!,"My baby LOVE all the Avent Product!  That is our best reference!<br /><br />You can reuse all the Avent products, easy to combine with other options."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for our City Mini Double,"We purchased this to go on our City Mini Double stroller for a recent trip to Disney World.  I can't believe we lived without this for so long!  The BJ attachment was expensive, so I was so happy to read the reviews on this and find out how well it worked.  The stroller folded up with it still attached, and it was a great spot for drinks, cell phones, maps, baby shoes, etc.  Very sturdy and stable for drinks and made of tough material.  An employee of a stroller rental company stopped us outside of our hotel to ask us about our Buggy Buddy. He said that his company rented out the same stroller and had the BJ parent accessory, but it was not as substantial.  He loved the way this one was made and was going to look into it for their rentals.  Would definitely recommend it!"
Baby,5.0,very good mobile,"I love this one. I am expecting a baby. I am sure she will love it. The toys, mobile leaves and music are beyond my expectation.   The lights could be better, though."
Baby,2.0,Not a favorite,"My son is 4 months old and will only take a pacifier if attached to a stuffed animal. It nakes it easier for him if he drops it, he can get it back into his mouth mostly on his own. I thought we would try this brand as a back up for his other one. When it arrived, I felt the quality was poor and there is no way to change the pacifier. The other one we have can easily detach so the stuffed animal can be washed in the machine. I can carry extra pacis in case one gets dropped or spit up on and I am not in a place to wash or at least rinse it off. I would not suggest this brand."
Baby,5.0,Works great with the MacLaren Volo,"Good quality and adds the extra storage space I need.  The cupholders are a little tight for a coffee to-go cup (for example), but fit my metal water-bottle just fine."
Baby,4.0,Great product but maybe not for every baby,"We originally bought this mobile in 2007 for our now 3yr old daughter, she LOVED it so much that we left it up until she could unscrew it from the crib (about 15mths).  The music is perfect for soothing very soft & slow and the motion is engaging enough to grab their attention but subtle enough to lull them to sleep.  Also the battery life is decent, in use every night & 2 naps a set of batteries would last 4-6 months.  Even after being in use that long it was still in great condition so we took it out for our son (2 months old) but he does not appear to be a fan.  Possibly he'll like it as he gets older but for now even the soft music & motion is too stimulating for him and gets him worked up rather then soothed.  A simple heartbeat generator w/ no motion or light soothes him best, so I would say no matter how great the product is know your child & what works for them. [BTW the 3yr old still loves it & doesn't understand why it upsets her brother!]"
Baby,5.0,It does it's job,Keeps the milk in and doesn't leak.  Takes up less space when traveling.  I plan to use these with my 4 ounce bottles as baby food jars when my son is old enough for solids.
Baby,4.0,Sunshine Stroller Buggy Buddy,"RIP-OFF. This is the WORST transaction I have EVER had. Ordered the stroller that should have been rushed and this accessory. After telling vendor we'd made a mistake on which order the express shipping should be on (the cost by the way was more than the actual Buggy Buddy!) I don't know who CAN'T correct an order a lousy TEN MINUTES after it was made. You people are excellent at taking money from customers with the excuse it can't be corrected. BULLLLL. As I'm sure you won't keep this one posted because you look BAD, hope someone sees it before it's pulled. Thanks for nothing."
Baby,3.0,One leaf clunks/sticks loudly,"I think this mobile is very neat looking, and sturdy. It is heavy but secured easily to our crib. Our daughter seems to like it, she is 7 months but can't crawl yet. The volume is just fine even on the lower setting for us. Our daughter isn't around a lot of loud tv or anything anyway. The rain forest sounds are a little quiet but that's okay because they are mostly crickets anyway. I love the music, it is so clear, it sounds great, all of the settings are soothing, not too fast.     I have not seen any other reviewers say this, so I am hoping we got a defective one but our mobile has one big leaf that sticks and delays coming down, and when it does it makes a fairly loud clunking noise which sometimes startles our baby. I don't think we could possibly use this mobile to help her sleep... or a future younger baby sleep. We plan on exchanging it and if our new one clunks I am not sure what we will get."
Baby,2.0,Sippy Support,"This holds many things and even heavy items. However, I made the mistake of closing it along with the stroller and it bent the metal in half. I assume you need to take it off and re-affix it every time you take out the stroller, which is a pain."
Baby,3.0,functional,"I ordered these to use instead of the nipples. I work and pump while at work and it wasnt very cost effective using a nipple for each bottle so these covers came in very handy. My only problem is when my mother is on the go with my baby, she cant use both the sealing disk and the nipple like with some other bottles."
Baby,4.0,Soothing Animal Kisses,"The Petite Consumer's review:<br /><br />The Wubbanub is a super cute Soothie silicone pacifier that is attached permanently to  a special weighted stuffed animal in a variety of styles. The stuffed animal prevents the pacifier from rolling away, makes it easier for a baby to grasp and manipulate, and helps keep the pacifier in the mouth.<br /><br />Coos<br /><br />BPA, PVC and Phthalate Free.<br />Uses a Soothie which is a medical grade, latex free pacifier.<br />Prevents the pacifier from rolling away from the child (and possibly less screaming from baby).<br />Plushie may help soothe baby due to the way it \\""cuddles\\"" baby.<br />Plushie allows babies to grasp and manipulate pacifier themselves.<br />Lots of cute animal plushies to choose (Ilana's son had the dog...we think it is really cute).<br />Perfect for a baby with low tone and other mouth issues (Ilana's son was unable to keep a pacifier in his mouth due to weak muscle tone. The Wubbanub allowed him to push the pacifier back in his mouth).<br />Used by NICUs and hospitals.<br />Can be put in the washing machine to clean (...and you will need to).<br />Plushie is secured safely to the pacifier to prevent accidental removal.<br /><br />Boos<br /><br />While the Wubbanub can be washed the pacifier can not be sterilized (due to the way it is attached).<br />The only pacifier that is used is the Soothie. If your child already prefers a different kind of pacifier it may be difficult to switch.<br />Due to its plush design, it is not safe for use in the crib per experts (we do not recommend using it in the crib and to use a \\""plain\\"" Soothie for sleep time).<br />If the baby becomes attached to the animal it may take you longer to wean off the pacifier (Ilana solved this problem by detaching the pacifier with some creative scissor work).<br />Dogs love to eat them (Ilana lost two to her dog...amongst other things).<br /><br />The Petite Consumer says: A \\""lovey\\"" and a paci combo sounds like a baby's and parent's dream.  A great shower gift too."
Baby,5.0,my child has loved it from one month to now  9 months.,"a great item. my little one has really been nursed to sleep with this. it is easy to install and works like a charm. i would recommend getting extra batteries, it takes 3 D (the big ones)."
Baby,5.0,Absolute Favorite Toy,[[VIDEOID:mo3OHY1NSFV0OPI]]Kyri is playing on her [[ASIN:B000FFL58Q Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym]] with [[ASIN:B000I2Q0F4 Lamaze Freddie the Firefly]] and Dee Dee attached to it. It's easy to see which is her favorite.
Baby,5.0,baby loves it,"My daughter has been interested in the mobile since she came home, but especially lately. She is now eight weeks old and will lie in the crib smiling, watching the animals, and \\""talking\\"" to them. This is actually the first object (aside from faces) that she acknowledged. The mobile was easy to install and the music is ok, not too shrill or irritating to adult ears. We all actually like the cricket setting. I would highly recommend this. It is reasonably priced and looks cute in her room, but most importantly she is fascinated by it."
Baby,5.0,Almost perfect,"The mobile is so cute and so interesting, that my baby girl cannot take her eyes off this. Easy to assemble, I have only two \\""BUTs\\"" :    One out of 3 leaves is not working. Doesnt move up and down, unless I poke it. ALso, the plastic screw that you attach the mobile to the crib with, is way too long. My crib is way too far from a wall.     Other than that - I would recommend it to everyone.     thanks"
Baby,5.0,Amazing,FP Rainforest Mobile is a hit with our grandson.  He is eight weeks old and follows the animals as the turn and is soothed by the soft music.  Strongly encourage everyone to purchase this as you won't be disappointed.
Baby,5.0,Awesome inexpensive parent console,"In my opinion, this console is MUCH sturdier than the bob console.  I bought one for each single stroller my family has."
Baby,4.0,red76kay,"Simple, cheap, works well.  I needed something to hold a drink and all the random stuff you end up needing a place for."
Baby,4.0,Baby loves it!,"I was expecting it to be a little bit bigger based on the customer images. Maybe, some of the babies are just smaller than mine so it made it look bigger. Anyway, our baby likes it a lot but I do wish the music played longer. It is a glorified stuffed animal, but if it makes her happy then I am happy."
Baby,4.0,Accessory Buggy,"Easy device to use, very easy to set up and use. cup holders are only good for water bottles mostly."
Baby,5.0,great with my baby jogger,"I have the baby jogger city mini double.. and unfortunately it comes with zero accessories. the baby jogger parent console is expensive, plus it had bad reviews, so a friend recommended this product, and so far it's been great... has two cup holders, and a nice zippered pouch."
Baby,3.0,Free Gym Mat,"We received this gym mat for free, and it was worth every penny!    Though our son liked lying on his back and looking at the various dangling parts of this gym mat, he is outgrowing it fairly quickly.  The musical ball is nice because the music is not annoying.  However, I am not sure that a baby could spin the ball fast enough to activate it by himself.  Once a baby becomes more mobile, his arms flail out beyond the soft part of the mat toward the hard plastic edges.      A bigger mat will last a longer time and offer more stimuli for the baby."
Baby,5.0,She likes it!,"This was a gift for my 11-month-old niece, and her mom reports that it's been renamed Boom and being dragged all over the house. That's a great review in my book!"
Baby,5.0,Love it!!!,"This is a must have! First of all, it stays on for about 20 minutes at a time and if any parent wants their child to learn to go to bed on their own with out you rocking them to sleep every night, this is the key.  I put him in the crib and although he fusses for a few minutes the movement and music slowly lull him to sleep.  Second of all if 20 minutes does not do it, you can use the remote control to start it back up so your baby does not hear you come back into the room.  It is great and now he goes to sleep on his own at night without it being a big ordeal.  Also, if we turn it on in the morning, right before he really wakes up, he will stay in the crib fuss free for an extra 20 minutes so I can get ready.  It is great, you will love it!"
Baby,5.0,like it enough to buy it a second time,"We go this for the City Mini stroller when we first got it a year and a half ago, and I just bought another one to replace that since one of the loops ripped off while it was checked in an airplane. This caddy does the job at a much lower price than the others. It hold two cups, with flexible pockets that accommodate a lot of sizes and are pretty secure. there is a good bit of room in the central space, and because the dividers are flexible, you can use the whole space for something large if you don't have cups. There is s zippered pocket for keys or whatever. It's durable and flexible, no need to remove when folding the stroller (although I will try to remember to take it off the next time it goes in a plane baggage hold). I don't fault the caddy for breaking on the plane. Why pay more?"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile!,"I received this as a hand me down--it's been through 3 babies so far!  It works great and my son loved it!  He's 9 months now and doesn't really pay attention to it anymore, but from months 2 though 7 this mobile made putting him to bed so much easier.  The sound level and brightness of it have been perfect.  He really enjoyed watching the leaved open and shut and the music is very calming.  It is now getting softer, but I haven't changed the batteries in 7 months so I think a quick battery change would fix it.  I would recommend to anyone!"
Baby,4.0,Too Cute!,"This mobile was a pleasant surprise...It actually was as cute as the picture, and the leaves really did move to play peek-a-boo with the dragonfly! The music is gentle, not too quiet or loud. The rain forest sounds are pleasant also. The size is not overwhelming like some of the mobiles I seen. Would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing a mobile....Patricia V."
Baby,5.0,These are required if you use Avent bottles!,"We do a lot of traveling so this requires keeping bottles in reserve for a baby on the go. I have never, NOT ONCE, had a leak using these sealing disks."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!,My 2 month old LOVES watching this mobile!  She smiles and coos at it whenever it is on.  The music choices are great as well.  Very happy I purchased it.
Baby,5.0,Loves it!!,My baby is only 6 weeks old.  Finding toys that catch her interest is hard.  She loves this thing! it is easy for her to grab onto and she likes the noises it makes.  I love it because it is adorable.  The little ring open easy enough to attach to her Pack and Play and her car seat.  Great product.
Baby,3.0,Nice as a decorative mobile for less price,I purchased recently for our son. The top part of the mobile is great with the moving leaves and hanging animals. The only thing that dissapointed me was the light up area with the music. It really does not light up very bright. Overall if you are looking to not spend a fortune this is a good mobile.
Baby,4.0,baby loves it... very versatile... not perfect,"I watched this item for months waiting for a  sale... finally found a one-day sale at walmart where i bought it for $17 (online).    the sound is very soft, but still enjoyable for baby.    The dual motion of the spinning animals and opening/closing leaves is very stimulating for baby. At 5 months, he still loves it. Of course, it has never soothed him to sleep - perhaps because it is so stimulating.    Also good to note - this is a very heavy (and top heavy) mobile. I find it places some pressure on the side of my (Davinci Emily) crib. This is not a good mobile for a portable crib, like a pack-and-play.    Smelled a little chemical-ly when I opened it... but that smell went away.    At first, one of the leaves was too stiff and stayed in place while the others moved... I would manually move it in time with teh others and after a few days it loosened up... I assume that flaw was just a fluke... most people dont seem to have that problem, but if you do - thats how I fixed it.    It is easy to take on and off the crib - as it has a screw back - but I think it kind of scratches the crib when I take it on and off... and the MDB crib does scratch sometimes.    Colors are very bright, cheerful and visible to baby. Animals are plush and very cute.    The product instructions say not to use past 5 months... we have - but will take off after baby pushes up on hands and feet.    Good to know that this converts to a crib music/light box after the baby is too old for the mobile. Music is soft and not annoying. There are three settings - night light (where the lower body of the mobile lights up) lights + mobile, or just mobile.    Quite a large, bulky mobile but baby loves it. Music lasts 18 minutes - just enough time for mommy to take care of one thing around the house! My active child cannot be fascinated by it much longer than that... For longer playtimes, we go with the Baby Einstein play mat."
Baby,5.0,Baby's Favorite Toy!,"Lamaze toys are the gold standard for appeal, safety, and just plain fun for babies and young children.  When this was opened on Christmas morning, the 4 month old that I bought it for would have nothing else!  It crinkles when they pinch or chew on the wings, and there are plenty of places for chubby fingers to grip on the dragon.  Love Lamaze, and we are never disappointed in the quality."
Baby,4.0,really great but can get annoying.,my son loves the soothie pacifier on the monkey. and i think the monkey is just adorable. it's easy to clean since all you have to do is either put it in the washer on gentle cycle and air dry it afterwards OR dip only the soothie part for a few seconds in boiling water. this is awesome when i bundle him up and it just lays next to him or on top of him. he's almost 3 months in a few days and he still doesn't know how to control his arms and fingers. so when he isn't bundled he tends to accidentally grab the monkey and pulling the soothie out of his mouth or knocks it off. he gets himself really frustrated and i end up having to keep putting it into his mouth several times. hopefully when he gets older and learns to coordinate his arms and hands that he'll be able to hold it and keep it in his mouth.
Baby,4.0,Life saver for any mom with a fussy baby!,"I really love this product. It does a pretty good job of keeping the pacifier in my 4wk old sons mouth. When I first gave it to him he grabbed onto the plush little monkey and held it tight. It stays in his mouth as long as he doesn't move around too much. I think that has to do with the fact that my son tends to suck and stop and suck again. If you have a strong sucker I don't think this would happen.     I gave this a 4 star rather than a 5 because not long after we got it (about a week) part of the stitching on the pacifier came undone. It still works, and the pacifier is still very secure, I just can see it possibly falling off in a few months or so...especially because it is all he wants to use. I do think it could have to do with the way we have used it (I place it in his mouth when I am cradling him close to my chest to calm him down, which causes the pacifier to kinda pull to the side...the same side that the stitching came undone on). All the same it is a great product and I plan on buying more in the future.    FYI- I purchased this product on Amazon from one of their private sellers. I got free shipping however spent 19.99 for this Monkey one because it said it was the last one and other sites had it on back order. I wanted the monkey so I spent the extra money (Most others are only $12-14), only to log back on a few days later and see amazon selling it for cheaper with free super saver shipping and the same seller still saying they only had one left. In fact I think it still says that lol. Just be careful when not buying direct from amazon.    All in all I am not upset for spending a a few bucks more than normal...even at that price it has been totally worth it and a life saver for any mom with a fussy baby!"
Baby,5.0,It's easier to find when they fling it,"I found the Wubbanub Plush Toy Pacifiers when my daughter's twins were a few months old.  The toy helped them keep the pacifier in their mouth better.  The biggest benefit I found was in finding it when it was thrown out of the bed.  Can't tell you how many times we had to hunt for the pacifier for my older grandson.  You wouldn't think those things would go far, but they do.  Now, I have a new granddaughter coming in a couple of months.  My daughter-in-law loves monkeys and is using a jungle theme in the nursery.  How could I resist the monkey Wubbanub?"
Baby,1.0,Cant hear the sound/music,I bought this product because of the high ratings but the sound or music is very low. I can hardly hear it. I am exchanging it for a different one.
Baby,4.0,"Colorful, and eye catching!","We wanted a mobile that had bright popping color, which was harder to find than we first imagined it would be. The Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile fit the bill and included some features we really find noteworthy.<br /><br />As this mobile rotates, the leaves flap up and down like wings on a bird. As the fauna spins underneath, the leaves drop down in the gap between each character, lifting back up and out of the way as the next animal approaches. This really seems to grab our 2 month old's attention and I consider it the mobile's most unique feature.<br /><br />The remote is handy for undisturbed restarts, allowing us to reset the music when it times out if she is still awake.<br /><br />The music is nice and plays at a very appropriate volume just as noted by many other reviewers. While my wife and I prefer the Baby Einstein product lines take on some of the classical composers, our baby seems to be soothed to sleep by the Fisher Price interpretations just fine. This was the one reason we gave the mobile 4 stars instead of 5. As far as functionality and effectiveness we are very pleased, just would have preferred slightly different musical choices.<br /><br />The unit attached to our crib without issue and assembly was straight forward and completed quickly."
Baby,5.0,I wish I had found them sooner.,We limped along without these sealing lids for so long until I saw them on Amazon. It allowed us to prepare bottles ahead of time as I felt more comfortable using these for sealing instead of the normal Avent nipple/cap combo. It was also nice to throw a few sealed bottles into the diaper bag and then just pop the disc out and swap with a nipple when we were ready to feed the baby. They take up so much less room in the fridge or diaper bag compared to having a nipple on the bottles. We never had any leaks or other issue. I am just glad to have found them.
Baby,1.0,already broke!,"I splurged on this mobile for my 2 month old... and he delighted in it! I really liked the way the objects moved for him; it is entertaining but also peaceful. It helped train him to fall asleep for naps on his own. However, I've had the item for not even a month and already the thing won't spin anymore. The music plays, but the objects won't turn. I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on it, especially since I've thrown away the packaging and probably can't return it."
Baby,4.0,"quality baby mobile, only a few small complaints","overall i'm very satisfied with the mobile. it's coloful and eye catching, the leaves oscillate up and down as the animals rotate.    the way it attaches to a crib, it would work best for level top rails, that don't extend solidly down too far (< 4\\"").    it's a little quieter than i expected, but that's good and bad."
Baby,5.0,My son LOVES this!!,"This was a great buy for the money!! No reason to pay a fortune for other gyms, this one does the job. My son loves this mat. We got some extra key rings to hang some of his other toys from and it keeps him occupied for at least 30 minutes at a time."
Baby,4.0,very effective,"this is a great mobile, my only critique is that the song ends too quickly. my son loves it. almost 3 months old and he stares at it and falls asleep to the music."
Baby,2.0,Makes squeaking noises as it rotates,"My 6 week old likes this mobile. I like the rain forest sounds and adjustable volume (although it only has 2 levels), the remote is convenient, the animals are cute (parrot, tree frog, monkey, and dragonfly). It was relatively easy to install (you will need a small screwdriver to open the battery compartments on the mobile and the remote). It does NOT come with batteries (needs 3 D batteries for the mobile and 2 AA for the remote). Unfortunately, it makes squeaking noises as it rotates and sometimes when I switch it on it will not start rotating, I have to push/pull on the leaves to make it start. If it weren't for these faults I would love this product."
Baby,5.0,Makes using my Uppa Baby more tolerable,I have a Uppa Baby Vista and I have purchased two cup holders at $25 each. They both popped off at some point and we lost them.  Not having cupholders made using this stroller very annoying.  This Buggy Buddy is absolutely wonderful!  I can even fold up the stroller without taking it off.  Nice to use with our Maclaren umbrella stroller too.  What a good buy!
Baby,5.0,Just what I needed,"I wanted a little extra organization for my lightweight stroller (peg perego aria - 10lbs and works like a full size)...however, PP makes crappy cup holders - they're small and cracks.<br /><br />I wanted to get an organizer that was closer to the handles so i can throw my cell/bottle and keys in - without having to fumble around my diaper bag or a purse. This works!<br /><br />I have a u shaped handle - full bar (like the photo) - it secures tightly and with little wobble with beverages - I still would NOT recommend putting a beverage w/o a lid as that's asking for an accident! The little zippered pouch is great for keys and maybe some cash. This doesn't get in the way of my stroller's recline or when it's folded up.<br /><br />Very happy!! I finally found something that works well with my stroller."
Baby,4.0,Good Buy!!,"This mobile has smoothing, soft music and slow motion which was the main factor for purchase. It's not too loud and won't keep a baby ((or you)) awake. The light it gives off isn't too bright. The mobile not only rotates 3 small, plush animals but raises and lowers 3 leaves. In a dark room a child won't be able to see the motion even with the night light feature on. It only plays for 18 minutes. Which is good and bad. Good: plays just long enough for a tired child to fall asleep before turning off. Bad: doesn't play long enough and upsets the child if it turns off. The remote is nice but only works if it's been on very recently. You can't start the mobile with the remote. Battery life seems good.    This is not designed for a soft-sided crib or playpen (which is what we originally had as our child's bed for the first few months). It's also not designed to fit on a very thick/wide crib rail. I was considerate of this fact when I finally bought a full size crib recently. I still had a little trouble mounting the mobile as the 'screw' part was far too long and I had to cut a couple of inches off so the crib could sit closer to the wall.  ***UPDATE 7/24/2011***  After having this mobile for nearly a year it stopped spinning properly. The music and lights working perfectly. So I thought the batteries were weakening. Even with new batteries the mobile needed help to start spinning sometimes. I don't know if it stopped spinning once it started as I would leave the room so my child could sleep. I contacted Fisher Price regarding the issue and they have asked me to ship just the base to them for a replacement. Seems to be a known issue.  ***UPDATE 12/13/2011***  I've had the replacement for about 4mons now and it seems to be fine. After reporting the issue, and shipping just the base back, it took about 6wks to receive the replacement which is a brand new mobile. I had expected just a new or refurbished base...seems kind of a waste. Oh, well. The 6wk wait sucked as my daughter still relies on this to sleep. We have the new one and haven't had an issue at all."
Baby,1.0,Doesn't fit,"I was very disappointed when I went to attach this mobile to my crib and it doesn't fit! The attachment is meant for small railings, so if your crib has a lot of wood trim, do not buy this! I'm sad because it's really cute otherwise."
Baby,4.0,"Good for some, not for others",I bought this product based on the reviews where people had written that it worked for the Uppa Baby Vista.  I have no idea what they are talking about ...  It doesn't stay up very well on the handle bars and it was always tilted or falling down on one side.  I gave up on it after trying it for a few weeks because my drinks were always spilling.    I did give it to my friend that owns a Bob stroller and she found it very useful.  The Bob's handle bars are flatter on top and therefore the Buggy Buddy doesn't slide down like with the Uppa Baby.      My quest for a good cup holder for the Uppa Baby lives on ...
Baby,3.0,"Nothing to rave about, but does the job.","First the good:<br /><br />It seems to soothe my baby and help him sleep, or entertain him enough that he won't fuss before falling asleep.<br /><br />Very colorful (though you can't see that at night) it does have a light up part that I like<br /><br />I like that it has the ability to be sound only or motion and sound, and that it has two sound settings, louder and quiet.  We exclusively use the quiet though.<br /><br />Has an automatic turn off feature so batteries are not wasted.<br /><br />I like the remote, I don't have to go over and risk disturbing baby to reset the music when it turns off.<br /><br />3 song style choices or rain-forest sounds<br /><br />Now the bad:<br /><br />My mobile is supposed to have the turn-y bottom part with the animals and the three leaves are supposed to fluctuate up and down.  Only one of my leaves move the others get \\""stuck\\"" in the up position.<br /><br />I wish there were more options for length that the music stays on.  Sometimes the time is not enough.<br /><br />The clicker remote button is actually kind of loud.<br /><br />UPDATE:  now the motorized rotating part of the unit does not function at all.  So I'd probably have to lower my original rating to 1 star now."
Baby,3.0,baby loves it,"My baby got a dog like the monkey, and he loved it from the begining. I looked around for different animals and I only found it online. Now my baby has the dog and the monkey, and he goes around with them and plays with them all the time.     I think it would be a good attachment for the time I start making him to not use the pacifier."
Baby,4.0,We use as a child's tray!,"I read all of the reviews on this product as a parent console for the stroller and I thought that it might do as a child's tray as well.  I'm currently pregnant with our third child and we're purchasing the City Mini Double Stroller.  We love the stroller but the accessories have to be purchased separately and they are not cheap.  I definitely wanted a child's tray for my two older children (6 & 2 1/2) to use while in the stroller but I didn't want to spend a fortune.      I decided to try out the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy because of the good reviews and the awesome price.  When the Buggy Buddy arrived I tested in out on our Sit n' Stand stroller and was very impressed!     PROS:      1. It can be collapsed and thrown in the stroller basket without taking up valuable space and is flexible so it doesn't affect folding the stroller, whether attached or stowed in the basket.    2. It has a pretty sturdy wire frame all around the top so that it holds it's shape and supports the items inside.    3. It is large enough to fit two Sippy Cups or bottles, and snacks or toys.  It even has a small zipper section that could be used to store pacifiers or other small items.    4. The Velcro straps are strong enough to secure the Buggy Buddy around the bumper bar of the stroller.  It stays in position without sliding along the bar or falling off while moving, if secured very tightly.    5. The fabric is super easy to clean if there are any spills.      6. Can be attached on either side of the bumper bar of the stroller.  This way it can be placed in the position most convenient and most comfortable for your child.  On the Sit n' Stand it works best attached to the outside of the bumper bar with our older children.    7. It can also be used as a parent console, its original purpose.  I love products that can be used in multiple ways!    8. Because of the wire and flexible fabric it should work with a variety of stroller types.  So, when my older children do not want to ride in a stroller and I go back to using a single, I can still use this product.      9. The pockets are deep so that the items are less likely to fall out when going over rough terrain.    CONS:    1. A younger child may enjoy kicking the Buggy Buddy and some of the items may fall out.  But, the tray can always be taken off and stored underneath the stroller when this becomes a problem.      2. It does not hold open drink containers without spilling them.  This is not a huge problem for us since we primarily use closed drink containers for our children (Sippy Cups, baby bottles, water bottles, etc.).  For the parents we have purchased the Munchkin Stroller Cup Holders to attach to the stroller handle and they work okay on smooth surfaces.  We plan on upgrading in time to the Baby Jogger Liquid Holsters (for the parents) which according to reviews do not spill liquids as much when going over bumps and rougher terrain.    3. It does not have a hard surface to double as a high-chair-tray-on-the-go.  This can be easily remedied in two ways.  One, bring a hard lidded container to fit inside the Buggy Buddy for messier food items. *Benefit: leftovers can be stored away for later. Two, use a disposable stick-on placemat to create a feeding pocket in the middle of the Buggy Buddy.  *Benefit: easy clean-up, just pull off and out with all the food leftovers safe inside and throw away. Also, these can be purchased in a super handy pop-up travel case.    OVERALL:    For the price, I think this is a fantastic product.  I am excited to try it out with the City Mini Double Stroller and hope to update my review overtime.  Thank you to Sunshine Kids for providing a quality product for a reasonable price!"
Baby,4.0,Works on phil and teds,"Works well on my older Phil and Teds ev3 inline doubles stroller.  It holds my drinks, wallet and cell phone.  The price is right too! Doesn't get in the way when folding the stroller which is great.  Not that great on my Maclaren Volo stroller, you have to detach on one side to fold the stroller."
Baby,2.0,Cheap strap,"I really liked this product.  It was working great on my Uppababy Vista, but it broke after about 6 months of use.  I don't fill it with much at all (usually just a water bottle or a cup of coffee and nothing else), so I'm not sure why it broke.  I really like the design of it, but I'm hesitant to buy another one because of the cheap strap."
Baby,5.0,Babies love it!,"I bought this for our infant twin great-grandsons, and it's a winner with both the babies and the parents.  The parents appreciate the music choices, and the babies are entranced with the figures and the movement of the mobile.  I'm going to buy this for another newborn in the family.  From my own experience with our babies and our grandchildren, I knew that Fisher Price would make a quality item and that this particular mobile would keep the babies' attention."
Baby,5.0,Love the Toy Dee Dee the Dragon,"This Dragon is very CUTE !!! My baby loves it even i love it too : )  Easy to take along w you ... i even bought Prince Lance, Princess Sophie, and the Story Book for them : )"
Baby,5.0,Favorite mobile!!!,"I bought this mobile for my third child and it is by far my favorite one. I usually by a cute one to match my baby's bedding but this time I wanted something different and this was the best mobile I could find. It has different kinds of music, remote, very colorful, and moves which are good for a baby learning new things. Great item and would recommend to anyone!"
Baby,4.0,"Pretty good, but definitely not perfect","This is a pretty cool accessory - I use it on both my Joovy Kooper stroller and our Burley D'Lite trailer.    The metal bar in it that serves to stabilize the tray might get in the way when folding your stroller up, it depends on your model. I just usually work around this by unhooking one side of the tray before folding my stroller.    I wish the cup holders were a tad larger so I could put more than a water bottle in there. It seems like they're made for disposable water bottle sized items, but we never use those. Still, I can get drinks in and out suitably.    I love the tray portion in the middle. It's fantastic for throwing my keys and cell into.    Overall a good product, but not perfect."
Baby,5.0,Love it for my city mini stroller,"I have the city mini stroller and it has NO accessories, we've been without a cup holder or anything to put my stuff in.  fianlly i saw someone had used this for their city mini, much cheaper than what they offer for their strollers, so i thought why now.  ordered it and love it.  I think i can use it pretty much anywhere even after i am done with the stroller."
Baby,3.0,caddy,"This product is ok, but really have to watch when you collapse your stroller as mine got bent very easily.  It's never been the same so I guess you should really remove it each time.  That's not going to happen for me.  It bends back to shape, but it's always going to be kinked.  Hard to remove sticky spills or crumbs in the corners as it's nylon fabric.  Good for the price."
Baby,5.0,Adorable,"I like the product, it arrived on time as in the condition described. Very pleased with the service.  Thank you."
Baby,5.0,Very Cute!!,Very cute kids toy. It is so hard to find anything that really fits with my dragon theme but this is great!
Baby,4.0,Rainforest Peek-a-boo Mobile,"The Mobile arrived in excellent shape, was easy to assemble, and works well.  The only issue is that one of the leaves does not drop smoothly which makes the entire mobile shake while operating.  And... still trying to get the remote operation down!  Seems to work sometimes and not others.  Oh yes, the mobile is limited in where/how it is to be used.  Read the information on the height of the mobile above the mattress!  You MAY need to drop the mattress to use it properly!!!"
Baby,5.0,Brilliant! I'd pay so much more for the relief it provides,Best baby product ever. Great for babies in NICU since the pacifier won't keep popping out. Ibhave bought just about every style for my son or his cousin. She loves hers even at 21 months!
Baby,5.0,Great Product,"Easy to use with no frills!<br />We have a Baby Jogger City Mini and purchased the Baby Jogger parent console for loads more money. Of course, after 6 months of use, it fell apart. I recently purchased the Buggy Buddy and am impressed with its simplicity. The price is nice and I couldn't be happier.<br />Save your $ and buy this product!"
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,"I have a Bugaboo Cameleon, and this product works great!  It hangs vertically when attached and there are no problems folding the chassis with it still attached.  The cup holders aren't super great for waterbottles that are fairly tall, but will still hold it ok.  I actually use both this caddy and the \\""Jolly Jumper\\"" caddy together.  The Jolly Jumper caddy works really well for anytype of waterbottle, but this one is better for holding snacks, sunscreen and miscellaneous items.  This one hangs where the knobs to adjust the handlebar height are and the other one stays up near the top."
Baby,5.0,Crack for babies,"My daughter has these and LOVES them! She's in a pre-teething stage and is constantly looking for something to suck on. They're small and easy to fit in her mouth but I don't have to be scared that she'll swallow it because it is secured around her wrist with velcro. They are very soft, and the bright colors are fun to look at too. It's amazing to watch her use one hand to pull the other hand closer to her mouth in order to suck on the little ladybug's head. So cute!<br />And since they're fabric I can throw them in the wash every few days when they get really slobbery and gross.<br />I might even buy extras in case we lose the one's she's got. They are better than most of the other toys we have!"
Baby,5.0,My daughter loves this,"My daughter is 2 months old.  When she was born they gave a soothie pacifier at the hospital. She won't take any other pacifier and they are easy to lose and impossible to find in the dark.  This product is great because you can find it in the dark, it help to keep it in easier by having the monkey laying on her chest, and when she is not sucking on the pacifier she is holding the monkey.   This may be the most valuable purchase we made for our little addition"
Baby,3.0,Not at all what I was expecting,"Cute, for a little while.  My baby is 4.5 months old, and I highly doubt this will be used after he starts sitting up.    the \\""pillow\\"" for the headrest and for supporting a child to sit up is a complete and total joke.  I would never leave my baby sitting up with that thing around, it would just help him fall over.  Also, the pillow has no way to stay in place while he is laying down or sitting up.  It slides all over the place.  In fact, I have no idea where it is now.  It was an annoying to keep up with it.    The mirror is another joke.  So tiny, I don't see how a baby can even see in it.  Fisher price must have been using leftover pieces from other mirrors, it's so small.    I can see that as my baby learns to grab better, that the velcro on toys won't be staying up for long.    However, all that negative said, it does keep his attention for a little while."
Baby,5.0,Great toy! One of the best for baby's first year!,I bought this toy for my son for Christmas when he was just about 6 months old. He LOVES it! This is his favorite toy by far. He is always chewing on Sir Prance A Lot's feet and loves the crinkly sound they make. This toy keeps him entertained for a long time! I am tempted to buy a second one just in case anything happens to the first.
Baby,5.0,Great for kids wheelchair!,"My youngest son was born missing legs and one arm. He uses a wheelchair to get around. Because he must use his hand to push the wheelchair it makes carrying anything, especially a drink tough. He is very independant. So I saw this and decided to try it. I attached it under his seat in front.  It works perfectly! He was able to carry a drink today, and he keeps hand sanatizer and other stuff in it. Because it's under the seat it's out of the way, yet handy for him. Because it swings when he goes up a ramp, it doesn't spill the drink. He is very pleased with it!"
Baby,2.0,Good Idea - Bad Product,"[[ASIN:B000JIHP88 Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile]]    The Product idea is good...But the execution is bad...Considering the price paid, I thought I was getting a good quality product...But, the fully assembled set does not work as mentioned...    The remote did not work when the batteries were inserted. My wife had to open the remote and re-establish the connection between the Outer remote button and the internal switch on the circuit board to get it working...    Of the 3 upper leaves designed to flap up and down only 2 of them work as functioned...The Third always get's stuck on the \\""up\\"" flap...When the flap comes down, it does so with a sudden jerk and a very annoying sound, which can be scary for the baby instead of soothing.    We set up this Musical Mobile with the hope that when the baby arrives everything will be ready but the musical mobile has already started giving us problems....I selected this product considering the brand, Fisher Price...But it turned out to be a disappointed...  I do not recommend this product to any one."
Baby,5.0,IF YOUR BABY LIKES A FAN...,"My baby loves looking at a fan so I wanted a mobile that would be similar to that--not so much noise--just a little sound but mostly the idea of something moving continuously like a fan would. This is fantastic. Now, it does have sound but it goes low enough for baby to drift off--not like the wind-ups (sooo loud and then you have to crank them) It is very pretty to look at as well. I'm so impressed by it. Great investment. Oh and the remote is priceless. I onlyyyyy wish it would spin for a hint longer--however, it runs on batteries, so I guess the idea is it should go off at some point not to drain them and if you need it on longer you restart it."
Baby,5.0,My son's favorite thing EVER!,"My son will only take the soothie pacifiers so when I found this I had to try it out.  He LOVES it and wants it constantly so I'm going to have to buy him another one!  It's nice also as he has been learning how to put the pacifier in himself and hold it in by holding onto the monkey.  It makes mom and dad's life easier too!  The only issue is that it is attached so cleaning is a little tricky.  You have to cover the stuffed animal while you wash the pacifier.  He spit-up on the monkey so now I need to wash it, too... and I'm thinking I'll just throw it in the washing machine in a garment bag?  We'll see how that works...."
Baby,5.0,Great alternative to paying for Baby Jogger Universal Console,"We ordered this for our Baby Jogger Summit XC stroller and love the storage.  It is a great, cost efficient alternative to the Baby Jogger Universal console.      It holds two water bottles with an area in the middle for a sippy cup, keys, phone, etc.  The only catch is that you have to watch it when you fold up the stroller or everything will fall out.     Very glad we ordered this and highly recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Versatile stroller accessory,"I ordered two of these Sunshine Kids buggy buddies because I love them that much.  They've been helpful for carrying a sippy cup and water bottle, along with my keys and cell phone.  The buggy buddies fit perfectly on one side of my handlebar for the Baby Jogger City mini double stroller, just as the straps also work well with handlebars of the Maclaren Techno XT stroller.  I'm able to leave the stroller accessory on each of my strollers when I fold them up for storage, and the buggy buddy has been durable. You can't go wrong with using this stroller accessory as a cup holder - there's room for two, and a middle compartment that can hold your keys, cell phone, or another small item."
Baby,5.0,Great! Just What I needed! Don't need Baby Jogger brand Accessory!,"This was just what I needed, something to hold my keys, cell phone, water bottle and a pacifier while I'm out and about. Fits well on my Baby Jogger City Mini-no need for expensive Baby Jogger brand parent console. I like that there is a zippered pocket inside that I can slip my phone into."
Baby,2.0,This is is just okay,"What I like:<br /><br />- Colorful<br />- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining<br />- Small<br /><br />What I Don't like:<br />- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max<br />- \\""Musical\\"" part was two 5 second tunes<br />- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.<br />- Pillow is so small its useless<br /><br />This will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child."
Baby,5.0,Our Favorite,"The Rainforest Mobile was a gift to us and our LO loves it. I put it up when she was a few weeks old, and before I knew it she was completely entertained and would even fall asleep to it. She is now 8 months old and we still haven't had to change the batteries yet with every day use (several times a day).    I wonder about the people who say it isn't loud enough, because sometimes I wish it had a lower setting and feel that sometimes it is too loud. The light is just enough to illuminate her crib (guess I'm also not understanding the people that say the night light isn't bright enough, turn on a lamp if you need more light).     I especially love the remote. Never thought it would come in handy but it really does."
Baby,5.0,Love Sir Prance A Lot,My 3 1/2 month old loves this toy the best. She loves to grab his feet and put them in her mouth. It isn't too long that it doesn't fit on other play gyms.  THat is a problem I have found with some of the Lamaze toys. I wish there were more like Sir Prance A Lot. Plus I love the name!
Baby,5.0,Works great with UppaBaby Vista Stroller!,"Awesome accessory for under $10! We keep bottled drinks, snacks, pacifiers, etc... in there easily. There's also a zippered pocket to put money in. We don't have to take it off and on when folding the stroller up. It stays upright when the handle is at a 45 degree angle :-) Highly recommend this for the UppaBaby Vista, esp bc their cup holder is expensive and worthless."
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"I love this product! It is cute, easy to assemble, and easy to attach to the crib. However, the only problem I have come across is changing the batteries. You have to take it off of the crib, then take off the back panel, and then change the batteries.  My daughter's crib is against the wall, so I have to pull her crib out every time I need to change the batteries. The remote control works great, and the different melodies (or rainforest sounds) are really great. All around, I'd say I would purchase this again!"
Baby,5.0,Can't Go Wrong,We got this for our Micralite Toro stroller which doesn't have a cup/knick knack holder. It fits great and does the job for a low price. What more could you ask?
Baby,4.0,Love it,"We got this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He had a great time with it since there were so many things he could do with it.  He chews on the rings a lot and now this is in the car to keep him busy while we're driving.  He's 11 months now, and still enjoys it in the car."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic product works right.,"I have an Uppababy stroller, with a slanted handle. The straps of this cupholder grip the handles well and don't slide down. The bottom of the holder is rigid, so it doesn't become floppy when a cup's not in it. There's a zippered mesh pocket on the inside, great for keeping cash from flying out, and you can see what's in there. The two cup pockets are slightly elasticated at the top so they fit cups of different size with enough grip to keep them from flying out, but not so much that you have to yank to get your cup out to drink. The center section is spacious enough to hold my sunglass case, wallet, keys, phone, and pocket camera. I am 100% happy with this product."
Baby,5.0,Just what I was looking for.,"I have Avent bottles, but not an Avent pump, so I did not get any storage bottles.  Instead of paying $25 for a storage set, these plus the bottle screw rings cost me a total of $10, and work perfectly.  I would definitely recommend to anyone pumping and using Avent bottles (I like being able to use the 9oz size for storage, because they are much larger than what my pump came with)."
Baby,5.0,Easy to open one-handed,"I have not had problems with the snap like other reviewers, probably because I have it in one of the pockets of the diaper bag, so I have no reason to be hanging the wipes case from anything.  This is a great wipes case because you can open and close it with one hand, which, as we all know, is what happens when you go to change baby boy while you're out to eat with the family and you are working in tiny bathroom quarters!"
Baby,5.0,Great accessory for those lightweight strollers that need a good set of cupholders.,Excellent accessory for our Maclaren Traveler stroller.  Does not get in the way.  Keeps drinks upright and solves the problem of not having adequate cup holders.  Very affordable too.
Baby,5.0,Works great on the Bumbleride Indie,"Love this product, Its exactly what i needed- hangs low and out of the way so you can grab stroller easily. And the price is right."
Baby,5.0,LOVE it,"My sons favorite toy to this day, he's now 5 months old, is the Kitty that hangs from this playmat! It makes the cutest noise when the ball turns and is black and white, so I believe he really loves the high contrast.    Sometimes he plays with it for 10 minutes, sometimes he plays with it for over an hour. Just the few times he's played with it for that long makes it well worth it :D"
Baby,5.0,Great Purchase!,I bought this for my daughter.  It was a great buy.  She loves it and I love it because it helps her to fall asleep!  Totally recommended.
Baby,5.0,SO cute,"We got this for our son thinking that it would help him learn how to put his paci in sooner (which it did help) but shortly after purchasing this he gave up his paci and refuses to take it. :( In the short few weeks that we used it, it was great! Plus, it's harder to lose because it's bigger."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,"My son loves the mobile! Attaching it to his crib did not harm the wood (on his crib) but kept it secure. Very soft, soothing music for my son to fall asleep to. The animals are very colorful and attract his attention. Wish I would had this before now!!"
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"This was very handy to have on a recent trip to DisneyWorld.  Doesn't take up much space, drink holders hold things securely.  I used the middle pocket for storing cell phone, napkins, etc.  Would recommend this to anyone!"
Baby,1.0,Wipes case,"Terrible!  Did not like this at all, I should have sent it back but for the price it wasn't worty it!  The wipes dried out, the case was hard to close and those stupid red dots never worked and fell out all the time!  Don't waste your money!"
Baby,5.0,Handy basket,Great product!     My stroller just has a large storage basket underneath and I needed some form of storage that was within arms reach for little things. The Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy came to the rescue.  It holds my drink and any snacks I bring along for myself. You can't see from the picture but there's also a little zip mesh pocket inside which is great for storing parking tickets in shopping centres and keys (instead of fumbling around in my handbag). Price can't be beaten either! Thanks Amazon for a really useful product.
Baby,4.0,Does the job,"I have this on my BOB revolution and it works great. My friend has the BOB one and I like this one better. With that said, I would like it more if it was about 2 inches wider... there's a gap between it and the handlebars and that space would be good to have. But since this is an accessory for multiple strollers, I understand that it's not going to fit every one perfectly. I would definitely by it again."
Baby,4.0,My niece loves it!,"I got her this toy when she was 2 months old and couldnt stop staring at it, she loved it back then and she loves it now that she is 8 months... the rings in its left arm let loose and I belive this happen when she was like 6 months old (not a strong baby yet, so it brook easily) but she loves it, the sound, the colors and the textures. Great gift!"
Baby,4.0,Works with Baby Jogger Summit,"I'm not sure why no company spends a few days reading everyone's complaints about strollers within each category, and makes adjustments to steal market share. One of the big complaints many have about joggers is that the jogger can't carry any water. I understand the need to prevent imbalance, but a small water bottle is insignificant. This product solves the problem, as well as letting you store your keys, cell phone, etc so they don't rattle around in your pocket while you run. It does work well with the Joovy Zoom and the Baby Jogger, although the hand brake on the Jogger sort of interferes with access to the central pocket. That isn't a problem with this product, of course, and wouldn't prevent me from buying this again.    It does tend to wander along the handle a bit, which is my only reason for deducting a star. I still recommend this product though."
Baby,4.0,"Cute, music a bit quiet","This is a cute mobile and seems worth the price. As others have mentioned, the music is a bit quiet but it's a nice volume for going to sleep and I think it sounds a bit louder for the baby, who is closer to it. Our daughter enjoys it and she was 4 months old when we bought it. This is the second mobile we've purchased and we chose this one because our other one needs to be hand-wound and only plays for a couple of minutes. I like that this one plays longer so keeps her entertained longer. Our baby also likes to watch the light that this shines when she's going to sleep."
Baby,5.0,Excellent purchase,This is such a great item for parents. So easy to attach to stroller fits ANY stroller ( we use it for several different strollers) and makes life easier! fits 2 drinks  a cell phone keys and other misc items you aquire while out strolling with baby. Also has a small zippered pocket to place crdit cards or important items securely. The price is great as well value for your dollar. Buy this you won't regret it
Baby,4.0,So cute & fun!,"My 2 month old has had her \\""wubby\\"" for a month now, and we love it. She's not a real oral child - hated all other pacifiers, but she enjoys her wubbanub for both sucking on & just playing with. She likes to pull on the monkey's ears.<br />It's expensive for a pacifier (why I gave it 4 stars), I wish they were cheaper so I could buy her more! But overall, we love it."
Baby,5.0,These are colorful and full of sounds and textures.,I bought these for my 12 week old and he loved to look at them. I use them as a sensory stimulation for his hands and ears. They are full of different sounds and textures.
Baby,5.0,Great for sleep and play,"This was a great purchase.  I bought it second hand, and it has been holding up, which speaks well of its durability.  It works well for putting the little one to sleep with the lights out, but it also entertains him for quite some time when he is awake.  He loves the music (at first he spent most of the time staring towards the speaker, smiling and cooing), and a plus is that the music, though electronic, manages not to be irritating to us the parents (we have to hear it through baby monitor when we are out of the room).  The three options for classical music (which on my model are confused, by the way:  you press Beethoven, you get Mozart, etc.) each play two pieces, so there is a good deal of variety, and of course there is the jungle sounds option which is best for sleep.  The moving figures are colourful and stare down at the child, and they not only go around in circles, but when they brush up against the leaves they spin around on their own strings a bit, which keeps baby fascinated.  I was worried at first that they were moving too slowly, but the speed seems to be just perfect for the baby.  The only criticism is that, as many reviewers have pointed out, the light isn't very bright, but we didn't buy it for the light so this isn't a big deal."
Baby,5.0,Our daughter's best friend,"Our daughter has been enjoying Wubs, as we call him, since she was 3 months old. Now she's 20 months and she still likes having him around. I can't imagine having used a regular pacifier at this point. Wubs has been such a big part of her life. We have two so that one is available while the other is in the washing machine. She actually demands both of them when she goes to bed or takes a nap though.     She'll be weened off the pacifier soon. We might buy a third and clip the pacifier off of it so she can still keep the monkey as a toy/companion. We could do that with one that we own now, but I wouldn't want to do that to one of them.    We bought two of the giraffe Wubbanubs for our new daughter who is now 10 weeks. The monkey is easily the cutest, but we needed to differentiate.     If you're on this page and are considering purchasing...do so now! You won't regret it. I just can't believe these have not made their way into the big retailers. Either the company hasn't approached them or the buyers for these retailers don't have kids and don't have a clue."
Baby,5.0,A Must have,"Most strollers have a crappy drink holder. I have the Peg Perego Si and the first time taking my baby out and about my drink fell on the floor and spilled everywhere. I then purchaced the sunshine kids accessory buggy buddy and now I just love my stroller. It is very functional as it can hold just about anything and even has a zippered pocket. I place keys, wallet,cell phone and usually a drink in it. Its also very sturdy. It folds up with the stroller so i dont have to take it on and off which is a huge bonus. The accessory buddy will probably fit all strollers and is a great addition to your sroller. anything that makes your life easier is worth it. I love it and recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Should be Standard Issue,"I bought this (elsewhere) for my jogging stroller, which didn't come with any kind of accessory tray (I guess they figured you could reach under the seat into the tiny mesh carrier for your water).  I then went back and bought two more for the other strollers.  This thing rocks.  It holds a bottle or sippy in one drink holder, my Thermos double-walled water bottle or my double-walled coffee mug in the other (which don't fit in standard hard-plastic accessory trays), plus phone, keys, snack pod, earbuds, sunglasses, and probably a small elementary school in the middle compartment.  It wears extremely well and is very tough, withstanding an energetic toddler tugging on it in a mistaken effort to rip it off for access to the aforementioned snack pod.  I've had it for a year now with no fading.  Did I mention I love this thing?"
Baby,5.0,The best!,I love this case have had it over a year now and still works great i love that is is big for plenty of wipes to cover messes and diaper changes. Its also easy to grab a wipe one handed. Great item dont hesitate based on some reviews.
Baby,2.0,BIGGER and BULKIER than appears,"This wipes case is much bigger than it appears from the picture. It's bigger than a travel size wipes case. The red circle slides open to get a wipe out; interesting design that worked well UNTIL IT FELL OFF somewhere in a store? park? and is now completely UNUSABLE. The bulkiness of the case made it constantly bang into things and get caught on things, which is how the open/close mechanism broke off to begin with! For the price, it's not worth it!!!"
Baby,5.0,cute!!,"these are awesome/!!  i put em on my 3 month old and i put her in her crib  and she starts kicking away,babbling,giggling and shes having so much fun!!  i also have the wrist rattles!!  LOVE THEM  Highly reccomended!!!  :) :)"
Baby,5.0,My Twins LOVE this Mobile!,"We received this mobile as a gift and starting using the white noise/music player when our twins were about 1 month old and still sleeping in our room in a CoSleeper (we put the music player in a side pocket as it cannot be attached to a CoSleeper).  When we transitioned the boys into a crib in their own room, the mobile really helped them to calm down and sleep.  The toys on the mobile caught their attention from the first time we started using the mobile attatchement, around 2 months.  They really distract a crying baby and help lull him to sleep!  We had no problems at all attaching the mobile securely to the side of the crib.   We use the music for naps during the day and the rainforest noises for night time, both on the low volume setting.  The night light makes just enough light for the baby to be able to see the toys at night but not be kept awake.  The mobile also helps the babies wake up happy, we come in the room to them smiling at and talking to the toys.  The remote is nice when the boys are almost asleep and just need a little more white noise, I keep it hanging on the nursery door knob.  We bought a second of this mobile when the boys got too big to share a crib because we liked it so much!"
Baby,3.0,"Disappointing, overall..","This toy was a gift for my 5 month old son. The online product description and pictures look interesting. However, the toy turned out to be quite a disappointment. The musical notes on the trunk are quite hard to press even for an adult. The music does not last long at all. The only attactive features are the vibrant colors and the feet which make a crackly noise. Also, the ears are shaped like loops which makes it easy for my baby to hold on to the toy."
Baby,3.0,easy access is not so easy,I bought this case 2 months ago and the easy access is not so easy. I returned it and i get a new one that works better.
Baby,5.0,she loves it,This is a great thing to take out and about. Its something to play with and use in one. Not sure why everyone keeps saying they wish it came part to was it. WASH IT! its not like water is going to hurt the thing odds are if it needs a wash the monkey needs a wash too. We always just toss in it with the cloths.
Baby,5.0,dundeemarie,My little grandson just loves this mobile.  The leaves going up and down and the bright colors are a winner.  My daughter got this for him where they live in Massachusetts and when they came to Florida for a visit I got one too!
Baby,4.0,great for Uppababy,"The buggy buddy works well for the Uppababy.  It holds my drinks (even ones with lids) rather well.  The open area holds quite a bit.  Once you velcro it on, it doesn't slide.  I do have to tighten it every time I take the stroller out to ensure it is nice and secure.  It's a great buy."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful baby toy -- last for months of interest!,"Product description:  This giraffe toy has four \\""feet\\"" -- one plush black and white foot, one red plastic ring with smaller black and white rings on it, one red flat textured plastic, and one small round mirror with a black and white rim. The feet dangle from the plush body, the belly of which also has a black and white pattern. The head and body are plush, but the neck is floppy. A wide velcro-closed loop is attached to the head for attaching to other things.  Review:  I have a 6 month old son, and I'm beginning to notice the short timespan many toys are developmentally appropriate for babies. They just grow and learn so fast! This toy is an exception to that rule. We got this as a Christmas present when he was 2 months old, and at first, he mostly just liked to watch it as we dangled it above him. It caught his interest very well, though -- we would just hold it and twist it gently, and because the neck is floppy, the toys would just dangle and swing around -- worked like a charm at stopping a few fussy fits.   We then hung it from the bars of his activity mat, and he really loved batting at it -- the big black and white foot was the best (my husband called it the \\""hypno-foot\\"" because of the black and white swirl and circle design -- and it hypnotized the baby.) Once he was old enough, he really liked grabbing onto the ring \\""foot\\"". Now he is teething, and the red flat plastic foot and the mirror foot are great things to chew on. He has outgrown the activity mat somewhat, but likes playing with the giraffe while sitting or during tummy time. I have a feeling he hasn't found the end to it's uses yet!  Very few toys can hold the interest of a 2,3,4,5, and 6 month old (and likely beyond). The fact that this has a nice large velcro loop for attaching to things also means that you can attach it wherever without having to worry about using the plastic ring things -- it can wrap around a carrier handle or a crib rail just as well (which are hard to attach things to with the rings).  Love this way more than the Lamaze giraffe we also have (he has never been too interested in that one) -- so if you're going for a giraffe toy, get this one instead!  UPDATE -- my son is now 11 months old, and loves having the giraffe attached to the bar across his car seat. It worked as a great distraction on some long trips. I think he'll be disappointed when we move him to the next size up car seat and we have no where to hang it!"
Baby,3.0,Dry wipes,"I like this case as you can hook it onto whatever you may need to, and it is easy open, but it doesn't keep your wipes moist.  I went to change my son while I was out and the wipes were dry.  Not a pretty picture."
Baby,5.0,Love this,"Love this!!! Got this for my son when he was just newborn. I was shopping around for a binkie for him, and when I came upon the Wabbanub's I just fell in love with them. They are just the cutes thing, it's also very good cause it doesn't go flying out, when he's sucking on it. Even as a newborn he started to hold on to it with his arms around it. We love it, we've had so many compliments about it. I'd recommend it to any mom shopping for a binkie."
Baby,5.0,Daughter loves it!,"The only pacifier my daughter wanted was the Soothie and she is in love with monkeys.  So when I saw this, I was ecstatic.  She absolutely loves it as a paci and a toy.  It has helped her learn to grasp and hold as well as how to put her paci in her mouth on her own.  Watching her hold it is wonderful!"
Baby,5.0,First time father happy,"I am a first time father for my 1 month old. Whenever my daughter begins to cry for whatever reason I tend to get up and hold her while the misses says leave her. While I am holding her and walking around, she always seems fixated with the dresser with all the pictures deodorants and other usual stuff you put on top a dresser. So I thought to myself why not get something that she can get to look at while in her crib ... boom, found this mobile.<br /><br />The moment we turned it on she began to laugh and smile being amazed at it. Even now as my wife is walking around she is laying there looking and smiling at it. I cant help but to look and smile at her feeling a deep sense of happiness. I felt something in my heart this morning, maybe its an extreme feeling of \\""wow, my daughter actually loves this gift I bought her.\\""<br /><br />I am very grateful for this."
Baby,5.0,This is the best cup-holder,"I have a stroller that has one small cup-holder attached to its side, not good for anything really maybe just a 12 oz. can and how often are the cups/bottles larger in the real world....always. This product was the answer to everything. It holds large cups, stays on and upright, works great!"
Baby,2.0,blah,i wanted this to go with the stroller since it didn't have a cup holder for mom or baby. this is a hassle. you can't just leave it on when you fold the stroller. so i haven't used it much.
Baby,3.0,Low battery?,"This is a very cute toy and my daughter likes to chew on it a lot.  However, the sound is nearly non-existent it's so low.  I don't know if that's typical or if the battery was just low when I received it.  Either way that's a little frustrating for me."
Baby,5.0,Works Great on The Bob,I wanted an accessory that would hold my larger water bottle and not worry about it falling over.  The beverage holder is deep and actually is a little stretchy so you have some flexibility on the size of your drink.  I also like that there is a place to hold my keys and cell phone.  The best part . . . The price is great and it works on the Bob Stroller!
Baby,4.0,No teething ring,"Definitely my favorite of the Lamaze toys because it's so cute, but my daughter likes the moose and firefly better because they have hard plastic teething rings on them.  She usually chews on the mirrored tail which she still likes but not as much as the others."
Baby,5.0,Perfect Baby shower present,I was very pleased with these items. They are quality and lets face it cute. My now 17 year old grand son had a pair of these high contrast toys when he was a baby and it was a favorite. We all got a kick out of watching him discover his hands and feet. So I bought this updated version for a niece's baby and it was a big hit!
Baby,5.0,So cute and so great!,"My baby loves this binky! It has taught him to hold on to things as well. I like it because I can kind of 'prop' it up on him when he is laying down, and it stays in his mouth. Great quality and very cute! You won't be disappointed!"
Baby,2.0,Didn't last long,"The idea is great.  But unfortunately the stitching on the loops that attach to the stroller fell apart with light use.  I used this caddy maybe to put in a drink or keys a handful of times, otherwise keeping the empty caddy attached to the handles of my Maclaren buggy.  After a couple of months the loops came off.  The materials it's made of seem fine, but they should have made the stitching stronger or used some other way to attach those loops.  I will try to sew them back on, but it's a disappointment."
Baby,3.0,peek a boo rainforest mobile,"I was so excited to get this for my 2 month old! I got it and put it all together and got it running and then noticed that one of the leaves kept getting stuck! so i tried adjusting it a little bit, thinking I did something wrong. Well I have had for over a month now and it still sticks and wont go up down like the other ones do unless u push it down then it will work for a brief second then quit! VERY irritating especially when u pay over $50 bucks!!!!! My baby doesnt know that all the leaves are suppose to drop and raise at the same time, all he knows is tht he likes it. It is nice because u dont have to wind it up every couple of minutes! All in all it is nice and my most important my son likes it! I should of sent it back but I guess i didnt want to take the time"
Baby,5.0,AWESOME mobile!!!,"I absolutely love this mobile!! I just received it in the mail today and my 2-month-old son was fussing up a storm.  As soon as I got the mobile put together (which was easy) and I laid him underneath it, he stopped crying and started smiling and cooing at it!  I actually couldn't believe it!  He doesn't even smile at his dad or me yet!  I love the music options and the softness of the spin and of course the peek-a-boo leaves.  The dangling toys are adorable and seem to be smiling down!  I would highly recommend this product to anybody!"
Baby,5.0,Love it!,This Mobile is great! My son absolutely loves watching it rotate and the leaves going up and down! I definitely recommend!
Baby,4.0,Awesome!,"Totally keeps pacifier within reach and our baby is learning to put it in his own mouth now that the pacifier isn't falling all over the place.  And even when he falls asleep and doesn't need the soothing of the actual pacifier, he likes to cuddle with the stuffed monkey.  The only con is that I had originally thought the pacifier would be removable for easier cleaning or be interchangeable with other pacifiers, but that is not the case.  However, this item is such a must have in our house that we bought a second one, a dog (and it is quite fun to select a different animal)."
Baby,5.0,A child favorite!,"I actually bought this as a gift since we had one for my daughter when she was growing up and she loved it! What is funny she actually didn't use the pacifier part, all she cared about was the animal. ANd if we forgot it at home and didn't take it with us on a trip we had hell to pay for it!!    So it is a winner in our eyes!"
Baby,4.0,"Good, but not great","The product overall is great for strollers that don't have cup holders. I have a Combi stroller and it fits okay. It would be great if it had more straps or more flexibility on attaching it to the stroller. On the Combi stroller, it slides down a little too far for my taste, but overall I'm satisfied with the product."
Baby,5.0,Works great on BOB Stroller,"I bought this to use as a cup holder on my BOB Revolution stroller, since the ones from BOB cost more than twice as much. This fits the stroller great. A few reviewers have mentioned needing to take the holder off when you collapse the stroller so you don't bend it - but this is not an issue with the BOB. The pouch has a metal ring around the top surface that holds it open, but the sides are just fabric. With a stroller with 2 individual handles that collapse inward you would need to remove it so as to not bend the metal, but if you have a bar handled stroller you can collapse it and it collapses vertically just fine.    The two cupholders on the sides are neoprene dividers, they seem to accommodate a large range of cup sizes so far. The large center section has a zippered pocket it the back that is pretty small but would hold a set of keys or a phone. I'm not sure why you'd need to zip something in unless it was going to be something you'd leave with the stroller between uses, but there you go. The center compartment can hold a lot - phone, snacks, toys, etc. You can also put the neoprene of the cupholders to the sides if you want more center room or only have one cup. It attaches to the stroller handles via two velcro loops on the sides - the velcro is the whole length of the loop so it would fit a very wide range of handle types/sizes.     Overall works great for me."
Baby,5.0,Great.,I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.
Baby,5.0,Great product,"I bought this item for the top gear sport pet stroller as it didn't come equipped with a cup holder, I saw this for less the ten bucks and decided to give it a try based on reviews and I am really glad I did, it works great and it doesn't get in the way when I fold the stroller up so I am able to just leave it attached. The dual cup holders allow me to carry a beverage for myself and a bottle of water for the pooch as well when we go on those hot long walks. The extra compartments are an added bonus with enough room for cell phone, keys, toys etc."
Baby,5.0,Best thing EVER!!!,"This was the only pacifier my daughter would take. I didn't like the way you could see her sucking on it so I bought one of these. It truly is the BEST! She holds on to the monkey while sucking on the pacifier which I think soothes her, and can even grab the monkey and bring it close to her to start to suck on. Also, it's so easy to find in my diaper bag or in her car seat while driving. I could never go back to just a regular pacifier!"
Baby,5.0,Great for Baby Jogger City Mini!!,"I have a Baby Jogger City Mini and was looking for a parent tray cuz I and husband carry drinks for ourselves all the time.  Unfortunately BJCM does not come with a parent tray unless you order an expensive one.  So I grabbed this one at a store and tried it.  It is perfect.  I can still fold the stroller with this tray on, and there is no problem.  I like that I can put other stuff besides drinks.  My kid asks for cookies and snacks anytime but I can keep them on this tray so that I don't have to repeatedly take it out from my purse and put it back.  And you cannot beat this price!!!"
Baby,1.0,Really wished it was better...,"I'm sorry to also say...don't waste your money on this product.     When I ordered it, I didn't realize that this was going to be the biggest and bulkiest travel wipes case I've seen, yet.  I ordered 2 and had to return the unopened one.  When I tried to use it for about a couple of weeks, the wipes dried out and the red button didn't slide so easily.   The biggest drawback is that the case does not close securely like most wipes cases. I have a toddler and a 6-month old, so I was really hoping to have an easy-access case of wipes while on the go & while having the kids in the stroller.  The wipes cannot hold much at all especially with the case opening so easily. There were a couple of times where the wipes all fell to the ground while the case was hanging from the stroller during a couple of the kids' daily \\""walks\\"" to the park.  Also, why have a bulky case if you can't put more wipes in it than a normal slim case?"
Baby,5.0,A must have for your baby!,"My daughter is almost 3 months old and she absolutely loves these! It's amazing to see how her eyes focus right in on them an she reaches for them! She smiles and babbles while grabbing at the \\""bugs\\"" and it's just awesome to watch! I am buying more for friends' babies!I highly recommend these- you will not be dissapointed!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy for baby girls and boys,"My little girl stared at this hanging over her bassinet from when she was very small 2-3 months (or earlier) and now she loves to play with him and his crinkle sounding feet. This is a safe interesting baby toy for all the little ones. Has a \\""hook\\"" to clip anywhere like car seat or crib. Great to take any where. She also likes the rings on his tail and \\""jingle\\"" sounds he makes when she shakes him. :)"
Baby,5.0,Great Value Cup & Accessory Holder,"I was amazed at how great this inexpensive cup/accessory holder worked. We rented a stroller for Disney that did not have a cup holder, but knew we would need something. So, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it. It held two medium fountain drinks (or two cans of soda) as well as our maps, camera and sunsreen. It's very flexible and packs easily too. Note that it's made for a single stroller but can be used on a double stroller as long as there is a middle bar to affix the velcro end onto.Cup holder areas are elastic, while the end pieces are velcro. I will probably use this on my umbrella stroller at home now."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I wanted,This is a perfect stroller cup/stuff holder for our e3 Phil & Teds double stroller. I'm very pleased! 5 stars!
Baby,5.0,Great Rattles,"I was pretty scared to buy these rattles because there were no review on it about how good it rattles. But i decided to try it and put it on my 6 week old wrist. He moves his arms alot and the rattles work really good. Was afraid that it would not rattle enough but it is amazingly perfect. Highly recommend,"
Baby,5.0,Only paci my baby will take,"I love this product soo much. I love that fact that is had a soothie paci, which is the same kind the hospital had. My baby will only take soothies lucky me i bought this and he loves it. He is 6 weeks old and stil loves it. He is able to hold onto it himself to keep it in his mouth, and he hugs it which is soo cute. Simple, smart and best invention!!"
Baby,5.0,This Product won me over.,"Okay so, I was a skeptic. Really, I think I spent more than two months while I was pregnant doing research on mobile designs and asking friends. Given this was my 3rd child I wanted to make sure I did things right this time. You know, sticking to nursing, having more patience and actually writing in that baby book! Well, so far no luck with the baby books but this mobile is so sweet. As soon as I could find the batteries and attach it to the crib I put my 2month old son under it and the faces he was making were priceless. The leaves move up and down while the critters rotate. Adorable. Plus the music is soothing. I'd hang it over my bed too. The remote is a plus cause if he catches me going in to restart it he get to excited. Smart move Fisher Price."
Baby,5.0,We love this mobile!,"We bought this for our son when he was 5 months old, after using several mobiles that just didn't cut it.  We tried several of the wind up mobiles but they make loud clicking noises when you wind them and they last 2 minutes tops! We were looking for a mobile with a remote that we could use to start/stop the mobile from the door so we didn't wake him back up when he was drifting off or we could use it from our bedroom when he stirred in the middle of the night to occupy him and send him back off to sleep.  This mobile seemed like just the thing! Unfortunately, the remote control is not very useful for those purposes. It only starts the mobile up if you click the single button on it within a few minutes of the mobile turning off.  However, since the mobile itself is battery-powered and the music/sounds last 12 minutes, the remote is hardly ever needed. He's nearly always off to sleep prior to the music/sounds ending. A few of the reviews state the volume isn't loud enough. I don't find this to be true at all.  There are two settings and the loud is plenty loud for a baby drifting off to sleep. Since we've gotten this, I find he'll even wake up and play contentedly in his crib for a bit before letting me know he's ready to get out. He'd wake up and scream immediately prior to this. Our son is nearly 7 months old now and the colors, sounds, moving leaves and animals still captivate him. I highly recommend this mobile. Definitely worth the money."
Baby,5.0,Must Have Baby Item!,"So, when I was pregnant I bought a million baby 'must haves' that I thought were cool or would make my life easier. This is in the top 3. My son was born with a cleft lip/palate.. but he LOVES to suck. Unfortunately, with the cleft he isn't able to latch on normally, so the \\""spitting out the paci\\"" is constant with him. I decided to try one of these as a last resort after many many sleepless nights. It took him a day or two to catch on, but now he loves it more than anything. It is his \\""lovie\\"" and he squeezes it while he falls asleep, and holds onto it or rests his head on it after he falls asleep. It is truly a great idea & I recommended it to a friend who also loves it.     The only \\""CONS\\"" would be ..They make it sound like a beanie baby style toy, or \\""bean filled\\"" .. so I expected something heavier. It is very literally just a small plush toy, there really isn't any extra weight to it. So it can still be spit out (thats the point of course) but I think they could add a little bit more weight to help it stay where it's wanted without jeapordizing safety. Also, its been said a million times.. thankfully my little guy only takes Soothies, but for the babies that like a different shape of Paci, what gives? + The cleaning issue, which isn't really an issue, toss it in the wash, then air dry. Just wash the nipple in dish soap and rinse thoroughly.    I didn't realize how much I loved it until I couldn't find it yesterday.. I was in a panic! It is a good investment, although pricey for what it is. I just ordered my second one. (A frog this time!) .. so it has obviously won me over in all it's simplicity. ;)"
Baby,4.0,Baby Stuff,My daughter loves this mobile. The characters are so cute and the motion of the leaves keeps her interested in it.
Baby,5.0,Our son loves this mobile,"Our son loves watching this mobile. Both our son and us love the different music choices: Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Rainforest.     The remote control is a nice feature, but we have not used it yet. Our son is only 3 months old."
Baby,5.0,Great for Phil and teds,"I bought this item based on a review I read here.  I bought a Phil and teds classic stroller and anyone who has one will know it cones with no holders at all, nothing.  You have to pay top dollar for their ones.  I have used this for a few months now and love it.  Please do not think you can use a coffee cup in it unless it's one of the coved carry thermos as it would probably spill, but it's great for covered items.  It also has a zip pocket to secure items you do not want to fall out."
Baby,5.0,Lots of Fun,"My daughter absolutely loves this toy!  She is now 7 months old and has had it since she was 2 months.  She plays with it all the time and will cuddle with it when she starts to fall asleep in her car seat when we travel.  As a matter of fact, I had to buy a second one because she lost her first in a store.  Great fun and entertainment!"
Baby,4.0,Great for pre-rolling baby,"I bought this for my daughter to have at daycare. I liked that it was narrow & portable! Fits perfectly in a portable crib too.   I give it 4 stars because it's a good product for what it is; however, if your baby is rolling, get a different one. I wish I would have bought this when she was 2 months old not 4. She rols to much & needs a larger mat now."
Baby,2.0,Great idea...,"We really liked the idea of adding this caddy to our new stroller. The only part of the caddy that is rigid, in order to keep its shape, is a wire edge around the top. It broke the first or second time I folded the stroller. It's a little frustrating to unvelcro or take off the caddy every time the stroller gets folded. The elastic cup/bottle holders are great but you have to use two hands to get them in. As every mother knows, life is much easier when things can be done with one hand :) I will be looking for something to replace it."
Baby,3.0,"good idea, poor quality!","I recently purchased this for my  baby jogger city mini stroller. It looks like a good product other than mine arrived broken.  The velcro is detached from the strap.  Upon closer inspection, the sticking on the other straps are also poorly done.  To exchange it will take 3-6 weeks which would mean not having a drink holder for the best of the summer. If I return it the shipping cost is half the price of the item. I guess I'm going to attempt to repair it on my own.  If that doesn't work, I'll invest in the Baby Jogger Parent Console. If you get one that's sewn correctly, I'm sure it's great.  UPDATE:  I was able to use some gorilla glue to repair the broken strap.  I've been using it now for about 4 months.  HEre are the pros and cons:  PROS: Affordable.  Two drink holders (THis is nice when I'm walking in the morning with husband = 2 cups of coffee OR to hold my baby's bottle & my water.  Zipper pocket in the main console is a nice place to hold my cell phone.  It's just nice to have somewhere to easily throw keys, an extra teething toy, etc.    CONS:  Cheaply made (See above).  Cup holders can difficult to get beverages into. It's nice that they are stretchy so they \\""hold\\"" multiple sized beverages BUT they are hard to get cups back into with one hand (In other words, I can't grab a sip of water while walking.) The cup holders are not their own separate compartment so items can slip under the cup holders.  THis isn't a big issue but can be a little annoying. Swings \\""up\\"" when the stroller is partially reclined. I have a city mini so this might just be an issue on my stroller.    Bottom line - Given the cost of this holder vs. the Baby Jogger one , I'd still recommend it.  It'snot fancy and a bit quirky but it gets job done."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub Plush Toy Pacifier - A+,"I bought this for my infant grandson.  He would only take the pacifier the hospital gave him to comfort him.  In desperation, I found the same pacifier on Amazon.  However, there were animals attached. I've never seen one and it fit perfect with his \\""Jungle\\"" theme.  He LOVED it.  The plush toy allowed him pick up his own pacifier with his little uncoordinated hands.  Only problem, I had to buy a second one so we could take away the first one long enough to wash and dry it. A+ product, shipping and cost.  Well worth it.  Thank you."
Baby,5.0,Great product for the price!,"I recently bought a Baby Jogger City Mini and needed a cup holder badly. The ones sold by baby jogger were outrageously priced. After reading the reviews on this  Buggy Buddy, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />It is great! It fit my city mini and does not get in the way when I want to recline the seat.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed was that it had a really strong smell (smell like petroleum) when it was in the package. But once I attached it to the stroller and started walking outside, I couldn't smell it any more."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,I've been using these for the last 5 weeks.  They've been working great.  They do exactly what they're supposed to do.
Baby,5.0,Very Vibrant Colors and Fun Characters,"This baby mobile is very vibrant in color and the characters are fun :)  My son loves it!  There is a variety of classical music to choose from.  The sound is not very loud, but when you want your child to calm down and go to sleep I guess that is good.  I am happy with the product."
Baby,5.0,so much cute,"The colours are sooo bright and very much noticable to alittle baby. they are sooo much cute on the hand of my niece and when she moves her hand and hear the noise, her eyes open wide and she repeat the movement again. so much fun to see her enjoy it that much. they are so soft and also washable which fits with small little babies. Recommended :)"
Baby,5.0,Works like a charm,Works as expected. I use this with my extra bottles for storing pumped breast milk so that it can easily be warmed and served to baby.
Baby,5.0,perfect holder,"This item is a great addition to our i'coo targo stroller.  I go walking with my daughter a bunch and its a perfect place for my water bottle, large wallet and i-phone.  It's really easy to get my water bottle in and out of the stretchy holder (it even easily fits a medium iced coffee from D&D.)  Its very sturdy and it does not feel like it will tip over.  It solved our need for a cup holder and is even better since it holds a bunch more!"
Baby,5.0,"Spacious, and perfect for Phil & Teds!","This is PERFECT for my Phil & Teds. It is very spacious, has plenty of room for 2 drinks, 2 smart phones, keys and even more stuff. The reason this works well for Phil and Teds is because it is collapsible, and I don't have to remove this when I fold the stroller, it just collapses along with the stroller so it doesn't take up any extra space when it is folded. One less thing to remove and put on again when folding. Also, the price can't be beat!! Great product."
Baby,5.0,Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"This was a present for a friend and her husband -- they are having a baby in a few months.  I particularly liked the fact that I was able to access their baby registry from my account and the fact that when I finished up MY order, HER order was listed separately and delivered to her so quickly.  Thank you."
Baby,5.0,Great seal for Philips AVENT bottles,"I purchased these to seal up my expressed milk in the fridge and to take bottles on the go with me. They work great and I haven't had any leakage problems. I haven't used them in the freezer yet, so I can't comment on that."
Baby,5.0,Awesome product for vision deficits,"I purchased these socks for my cousin who is four months old and has vision deficits.  The doctor recommended working with her on the colors of red, white, and black and these socks fit the description.  Since she's been wearing/playing with these, her eyesight has improved, her ability to track objects has improved, and she loves to have them on her feet and \\""find\\"" them."
Baby,5.0,very good,"very colourful and good quality musical mobile.My baby loves it.Only disadvantage may be the low volume of the music,but in a way that encourages sleep.was very easy to assemble."
Baby,2.0,Cheap and uncomfortable,"My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.   Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.  Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it."
Baby,5.0,simply great!,"my son LOVES this mobile! at the beginning when my son was very colicy and I was alone during the day this mobile saved my life! I was able to sneak in a quick shower while my son was lying in the crib looking at the mobile being relaxed, calm and  amazed!"
Baby,5.0,Great Product,"This is great! It helps keep the pacifier near baby's mouth, which is a lifesaver when driving. Our baby also loves playing with the toy monkey."
Baby,3.0,"its ok, theres better..","we chose this since we have a small space. it was perfect he loved the mirror (great for belly time).  you can move the bar to the other location where the giraffe and tree are, this was his favorite as he learned to kick before batting his hands and loed kicking the tiger to initiate the music.  also this fits easily into the crib so baby can play totally safely and can allow housework to get done.  when he got older we would put him in his bumbo seat on it, he would be entertained by batting the toys for a little while.<br /><br />then baby got to the point of rolling over and we wished we chosen one of the large ones that are easily collapsible. he would roll to his side then fall onto his belly with his head hitting one of the side which is plastic.  he eventually learned not to let his head fall onto the plastic but it was necessary for him to learn this way.<br /><br />nevertheless, we are having our second baby and still going to use this.  not into wasting someones thoughtful gift plus it held up so well, looks brand new after baby used it for 8 months."
Baby,5.0,My son's favorite toy for several months and still going strong,"I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I had to write one about this toy. I agree completely with the first reviewer. My son received this toy as a gift when he as about 2 and a half months and he's been playing with it every day since then. It's currently my go to toy to make him happy. It goes with us everywhere and I was actually looking to buy a second one to keep in the car.  This is an awesome toy."
Baby,1.0,does not fit,cute looking but doesnt fit on our crib.  nowhere did i see on website that it may not be compatible with all cribs.  our crib is also brand new.  the top bar of the crib where the  mobile should be mounted is either to thick (the lengthwise bars) or graded (the widthwise bar).  the box did say it may not fit all cribs but how was i to know until i tried to install it.
Baby,5.0,Works with Peg Perego!,"After trying various cup holders and hooks, etc, I am really pleased to find something that actually works on my Peg Perego stroller. The bars on this stroller are pretty thick and all the cup holders that are made for umbrella strollers don't fit (the bars are a lot thinner on umbrella strollers). This caddy has a velcro strap on each side that you can adjust to fit securely between the open space of the handles. There is a snug cup holder on each outside edge of the item, with a space in between for sunglasses, maps, sunscreen, or snacks, etc, plus a zippered pocket on the inside for keys, membership cards, or whatever. One reviewer mentioned that it swung a bit (but you can tighten those velcro straps so that it barely moves at all) so you need covered drinks, and maybe that's true... but we always use those anyway, and the drink holder pocket is flexible enough to hold a good size, tall cup and keeps it steady. I am a very happy buyer and highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't have cup holders on their stroller and even those who do, but want a little more storage space. Also... it stays on very nicely when you fold the stroller, no need to remove. Love it!"
Baby,5.0,"My nephew love this ""toy""","We (me and my wife) bought this for our nephew a few months after he was born. He loves it. It really entertains him. His parents love it to, because it is an educative toy and helps with the development of the child.    Great purchase."
Baby,5.0,Great Mobile,"I put my 7 week old under this and it occupies her for half an hour easily so I can get things done around the house. She hasn't started sleeping in her crib yet, but when she does, I'm hoping this will put her to sleep, though she's a great sleeper as it is. It's really cute, the branches move up and down and music is very soothing. The price on Amazon is the cheapest around too."
Baby,4.0,helpful,I've lost several bottles of milk thanks  to leaking through the nipples.  These are a must when traveling with pumped milk!   No leaks so far.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,This product was recommended to me by a friend who has two children - she was absolutely right.  The case is great for holding so many wipes (I constantly don't have to refill it) and the red dot makes it easy to open and close with one hand.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!
Baby,5.0,Love Them!,Put these on my 3 month old son today and I've never seen him kick his little legs and feet with excitement so hard!  HE LOVES THEM!  About 2 hours later I noticed that he was staring at his feet when the socks were off.  This was the first time that he's actually FOUND his feet.  Highly recommend this item!
Baby,5.0,I bought this item for use with my umbrella stroller,"I bought this item for use with my umbrella stroller. It works very nicely. The top of the frame is bendable and flexible so it is not too rigid, it forms nicely to the back of the stroller, and lays just right.  It also is not too heavy and doesn't make the empty stroller topple backward. I would recommend this product."
Baby,4.0,Baby loves it,"It seems to be well thought through product when it comes to colors and what the baby likes. Our son seems to love them, grabs them frequently and gazes at them all the time. He gets only frustrated when he can't manage to get them quite well to his hand.  For me, as mom, they're not so well thought through. They're made out of non-stretchy cotton, so they don't really fit snugly or well on the foot and they're a bit too short. I think they could be made stretchy so they would fit snug, so they would not come off the foot, and about 1 inch longer.  I don't regret the purchase though."
Baby,3.0,cute but small,"It rattles ok. I got some new ones from walmart that rattled so much better. The design and color are amazing. I have a chubby little two month old, and she only was able to fit in the wrist rattles for two weeks, and now they don't fit. If they were to fit longer, they would be amazing."
Baby,4.0,Great buy,"I found this to be great for the cost. Fit well, holds 2 cups, snacks, cell phone and the zipper pocket for my keys is a great bonus. Easy to put on. Does not fold in half becasue of a wire that helps hold the shape but for the low price I can deal with it."
Baby,3.0,Great colors but doesn't work so great,"My 3 month old son loves this Mobile, but mechanically it leaves a lot to be desired.  The leaves often get jammed in the down position which stops the animals from circling.  I had to rig the leaves so that they stay in the up position.  This allows the animals to circle freely.  It stays on for about 15 minutes which is just right for us.  The volume is really low, but since it's so close to the baby's head, I think this is a good thing.  I recommend it because I searched high and low for a bright rainforest mobile and this was, by far, the most attractive option.  And, again, my son really likes it."
Baby,5.0,love this,"This fits perfectly on my City Mini stroller by Baby Jogger. Love it. It can still fold perfectly and I love being able to carry a drink, my keys, and phone easier. Thank you!!"
Baby,4.0,so cute!,i bought this wrist rattle because my 3 mo. old can't really grasp with her little fingers yet. the color is nice and they look so cute on my daughter's wrist. you can hear a tiny rattle when you shake them. its only a 4 star for me because the length of the ladybug rattle is smaller which i am afraid won't fit my baby anymore. but overall this inexpensive toy works ok. whenever i think it needs to be washed i just throw them in the washer. then its ready for next use.
Baby,5.0,Nice Add On For A Light Wieght Stroller,"I got this when I bought my smaller stroller.  It fits well and I think that it would fit on most umbrella strollers.  It hold two drinks and other items such as keys, phone, small toys or snacks.  You do have to take it off when you fold the stroller up but I just unstrap one side and it works very well.  I have no complaints about this item.  It is a great add on to any umbrella type stroller."
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE these!,"My little punkin sleeps much more soundly with one of these in her mouth than with a traditional pacifier, because it stays in her mouth wayyy better so she doesn't wake up because it fell out. The animal's paws stabilize the pacifier and keep it from popping out of her mouth.  These things are worth their weight in gold.  Seriously.  We have the bear and the puppy, and both work great."
Baby,2.0,"Stops moving after a week, gets stuck!!",[[VIDEOID:mo1QZNNM6SB2S7U]]I Bought this Mobile and it stopped moving in two weeks per the attached video. It works fine if you remove the fabric leaves that come with it. I would recommend this if you are ok this happening as a couple other people have pointed it out in reviews. However the fact that it stops working deserves low marks.
Baby,3.0,son didn't love these,Love the concept but my son just didn't take to them and never really looked at them from 3-4 months in age.
Baby,2.0,great concept but socks hard to put on and don't stretch,I purchased these for my son after seeing a friend's daughter play wonderfully with a similar product (though her mom complained that hers were too big and didn't stay on which I could see was true... our kids are the same age).  The fabric does not stretch and my son was a big boy at 3 months.  They barely fit then and now his feet are too big to put them on at all at 4 months.  He also never paid any attention to them but I think that's just differences in personality and development.
Baby,1.0,they just don't fit on avent bottles,"we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective."
Baby,5.0,Can't drive with out it.,I bought this for are son.  Its easy to grab while in the car.  Regular pacifiers not attached to anything get lost in the car seat.  Also he holds on to it.  Its something for him to grip on and soothe him at the same time.
Baby,1.0,dried out wipes,"i added this item to my wish list cause i'm a sucker for cool design.     much to my dismay the folks at skip hop did NOT stick to the tried-and-true credo of \\""FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION\\""    the red dot required two hands to slide (one hand to hold the case, the other hand to do the sliding).    worst of all the wipes dried out after less than one week. i'm so, so bummed. and, my baby's bum is not loving the dried out wipes. back to the plastic baggie for travel wipe storage."
Baby,5.0,"Completely Adorable, Still Working for Second Baby","Bought this over a year ago for my baby son's jungle themed nursery. Still using it with a newborn baby and it has turned out to be the perfect mobile. It's beautiful to look at and both little boys have truly enjoyed staring at it, very calming. The music is nice, no complaints at all."
Baby,4.0,A great parent organizer!,"I recently ordered the Joovy Caboose Sit and Stand Tandem Stroller and knew it didn't come with a parent organizer. Instead of upgrading to the newer version, for over a 100$ more, I decided to look for an inexpensive organizer to attach to it. I found it in the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy. It has tons of space, cup holders, and a place to securely hold my car keys and cell phone. It attached very easily to the stroller too. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
Baby,5.0,Sunshine Kids Stoller Accesory,"I really love the Sunshine Accessory. But, I don't use it on a stroller, I have CP - cererbal palsy - so I use it on the side of my wheelchair. It is very awesome to have to hold sun glasses, wallet, drinks, about anything you will ever need when you're out and about.  I absolutely recommend this to any mother or a disabled person. Thank you."
Baby,5.0,Great stroller accessory!,"I bought this for my Baby Trend jogging stroller, which came with the worst cupholders ever.  This caddy is great because it holds my HUGE water bottle perfectly and has a nice zippered compartment for keys, cash, etc, as well as another large compartment for my daughter's snacks and sippy cup.  Great addition to my stroller.  I love the light metal rim, too, because it keeps the shape very well, yet doesn't affect how the stroller folds up."
Baby,4.0,It catches baby's attention,"I bought this for our baby with combination of Lamaze socks and it works out well. It catches baby's attention and the rattling is just right sound level, not too noisy, not too quiet. But, if your baby's hand is chunky, you will have little bit of issues with one of the rattles. The strip is made out of beautiful but fuzzy material and it is not too long, so it barely fits on the hand of our little one. The other rattle is pretty ok."
Baby,1.0,Not for us,"We got this because his paci was falling out, and he woke us up every hour to put it back in. We couldn't figure out how to get this to stay in place so he could find the nipple on his own. Maybe good if you start using it right away, instead of when they are older."
Baby,3.0,My son LOVES THIS!!!! Read update,"At 8 weeks old my son found his mobile.  We thought it was so sweet how he would look for it when we would put him in his crib and smile when we would wind it up. Lucky for us he would start falling asleep at the sound of his mobile we thought yes extra sleep time for us AND wake everY single time the 2 mins were up or was so mesmerized at watching the animals going around in circles start wailing when the mobile would stop, every 2 mins.  Finally, I started reading the reviews on amazon and about the different fisher price mobiles available and decided to go with this one in the end being that it had everything I was looking for in a mobile.  It took a bit to put together, but it wasn't too hard at all, I'd rather be safe than sorry. The colors are very vibrant and the nature sounds are very beautiful and realistic  along with the choice of music.  As soon as it was complete I showed my son and if a 10 week old could dance, he did.  His feet have not stopped kicking since.  He just loves this mobile and is absolutely mesmerized by it.  He talks to the animals and smiles when he is in a playful mood but when it's time for nap or bed time this soothes him immediately and he falls asleep in mins.  We've never needed the remote.  This was the best purchase we've made. I would definitely recommend buying this over the other mobiles. UPDATE:  he is now 12 weeks old and the mobile stopped working.  We've replaced the batteries and that still didn't fix the problem.  We were told by a fisher price representative that to fix the problem we should remove the leaves.  Needless to say we will be sending this item back which is just sad to us being that our son is so in love with this, shame on you fisher price. On the hunt for a new mobile sigh"
Baby,3.0,Not great for umbrella but OK for bugaboo-type handlebars,"I bought this to use on both my bugaboo and umbrella strollers.  It works fine on the bugaboo, although sometimes it slides down. When it's strapped to the umbrella, it constantly gets caught up and bent in the handlebars and warps the holder.  I was looking for something I could share between the two but this isn't it."
Baby,2.0,Not impressed,"They looked cute, but they really did not rattle very loud and the wrist size was small.  My grandson was not impressed and neither was I.  I would pass on this product."
Baby,5.0,"Universal, but good quality!","The reviews got this one right!  I LOVE this!!!  It holds my belongings and my drinks.  Has a zippered compartment as well. I use it for my Baby Jogger City Mini and it works great.  It even stays on when I fold the stroller.  I didn't want to waste $30 on the cup holders that come with my stroller, but this is truly a universal model that will work well on any stroller.  It is high-quality and not cheaply made."
Baby,5.0,Great Pacifier,"My wife bought this for her godson, and he loves it. It was smaller than she had pictured, but ended up being the perfect size for him. Talking about size, the monkey is the size of beenie baby. She said the only thing she didn't like was that the actual pacifier can't come off to be cleaned. Her friend bought pacifier wipes to clean it."
Baby,4.0,great product!,"This mobile is awesome! There is no motor noise and the different movements really capture my son's attention. He loves watching it for over the 20 minutes it plays, and I usually turn it on again for another 20 minutes before he drifts off to sleep. (and can do so without fully entering the room with the remote!) The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my husband had to rig it with a couple of zip ties to keep it on the crib (not recommended of course)since it has a screw back and was not compatable with our crib."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for a Pliko P3 stroller!!!,"I just purchased a Peg Perego Pliko P3 stroller from Craigslist because I wanted to consolidate strollers and get rid of my umbrella stroller and full sized stroller.  But, my only problem with an umbrella-fold stroller is the lack of a parent tray ... and in my case, a cup holder.  Plus, I've heard that the P3 cup holder leaves a lot to be desired.  I found this buggy buddy on Amazon, and read that it works for the P3, and it sure does!  I hooked it through the integrated hooks on my stroller so that it wouldn't slide anywhere.  It is perfect.  The straps are a bit too long, but I just rolled them up before securing them.  It doesn't have to be removed when folding up the stroller.  I love the two cup holders ... and so do my older girls.  I also like that it will easily hold my cell phone and keys and other \\""trinkets\\"" the kids pick up on our walks.  I had a travel mug of coffee in it today and it was just fine.  I like that it has metal around the edge to hold the shape, unlike some I've seen that collapse on themselves.  Great buy and very versatile!!  Highly recommend!!"
Baby,2.0,my babies weren't interested,"I have twin babies (3 months old when I got these) they both started crying when i put these on, i assumed it took some getting used to but they never really got into it. Waste of money IMO. =\"
Baby,2.0,Not worth it,"Someone posted a picture of a problem they had when they got there logan the lion and I thought \\""what's the chances, that I get one like that?\\"". Of course I got one with the same problem. The fabric wasn't stitched correctly and is on the brink of coming apart completely. This toy doesn't crinkle, squeak, or rattle. It does however have a ball inside it's head that on occasion sounds like a low growl that a lion would make. The colors are bright which is about the only thing it's got. I would go with Olivia the owl or mortimer the moose."
Baby,5.0,Love the Buggy Buddy!!!,"This little compartment is awesome! It provides a sturdy, handy place to store all the stuff that ends up in every Mom's hand: keys, cell phones, drinks, and more! It is especially helpful on strollers that don't have a built-in tray and it is designed to fit any stroller perfectly. It is a much better buy than similar products and the quality is outstanding. So worth every penny! Buy it now!"
Baby,4.0,Dragon,This was the MOST FAVORITE toy of my little girl for the first 6 months.  It's colors and textures have kept her interested in it for hours upon hours. Great Toy!
Baby,4.0,Great idea...Fit Is a Bit Off,"I thought these socks were a great idea! Our daughter enjoys wrist rattles, so we thought these socks would be an ideal way to help her \\""find her feet.\\"" The black, white, and red colors are great! The bugs rattle just enough to draw attention to them, but not irritate adults. I wish the fit of these socks were a bit better. They could use more elastic to better fit a variety of baby feet sizes. Instead, they are more like an open tube that can be pulled up and easily kicked off."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for our City Mini,"We bought two for our City Mini Double stroller.  It was perfect and exactly what we needed.  Have owned ours for several months and it has endured folding and refolding of the stroller (I don't take it off when I store the stroller), a trip to Disneyland and a lot of other day excursions.  I will be buying a second City Mini stroller soon (single this time), and plan to purchase another one of these consoles for this stroller as well."
Baby,2.0,don't stay on,"I got these for my daughter when she was about 11 weeks.  They are hard to get on her feet - they don't stretch and are almost too small for her feet already.  In spite of being hard to get on, she managed to kick them off in a matter of minutes.  She never even noticed them and has since \\""discovered\\"" her feet on her own."
Baby,5.0,great product for little $$$,"This Buggy Buddy works great! None of my buggies came with cup holders. (the more you pay for a stroller, the less you are entitled to a place for your beverage, apparently!)   I love the two cup holders, they are great for my water and my son's bottle or sippy cup. The compartment in the middle always has my phone, wristlet, any receipts or random change that I'm too lazy to put back in my purse, and a random toy of my son's. It's pretty roomy and the zippered compartment is great if I just want to throw in my ID and a few dollars.   The Buggy Buddy of mine got pretty much submerged in scalding hot coffee, went through the wash and came out looking brand new."
Baby,3.0,Safety Concern!,We have been satisfied with the purchase of this product and had no concerns with it until a few days ago. The pair of butterflies that hang from one of the corners are attached to the gym using Velcro. My 6 month old daughter pulled these off and started sucking on them. Within a few seconds she shoved these in her mouth and almost choked on them. We were lucky that I was reading a book by her side and was able to pull these out of her mouth before anything terrible had happened. Her eyes were all watery and red when I found her. I will be contacting Fisher Price today and hopefully they will recall the product or notify the consumers of this issue. She likes playing on the gym so we have put away the butterflies. The other toys are larger and are not a chocking hazard.
Baby,3.0,great idea. poorly made.,"I was so excited to get this mobile because it had lots of movement and colors for my little one to look at! HOWEVER... after only a few uses (less than a week) the mobile stopped turning. My little one loves this mobile (when it works) so I'm determined to make it work, but I feel that the company should have spent the time to make it work properly."
Baby,3.0,CHOKING HAZARD!!!,"First of all, my son LOVES this toy!  The feet have fun, interactive objects.  The colors are bright.  He holds it by the neck and flips it around and around.  He's liked it since he was 2 months old.  He's 6 months old now.<br /><br />Here's the problem... one of the feet has a mirror on it... the black and white circle foot.  This MIRROR insert came loose and presents a choking hazard if the child can pull it off... mine started too.<br /><br />I contacted KIDS II... the customer person (no clue btw!) suggested I needed to remove the plastic covering on the mirror and that the packaging states to remove film covers, etc.  Well, that was NOT the problem and she clearly does not understand.  I KNOW that you need to remove plastic films from toys...duh!  The actual MIRROR can come loose and come off in the child's mouth and choke them.<br /><br />I have removed the mirror insert now and given the toy back to my son, but POO POO on KIDS II for having no clue on this issue and not even attempting to correct it.<br /><br />Parents, just be aware and remove the mirror.  Feel free to contact KIDS II also and tell them what you think if you feel the same way.<br /><br />UPDATE (3-2012):  Kids II discussed this item with me and sent a replacement.  This one is slightly better, but my son doesn't have an interest in it anymore."
Baby,5.0,Awesome !! Very very handy !!,Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy Its the best one on the market to go with most strollers.<br />+ Very useful to keep cell phone and small purse - any small items safe.<br />+ It holds my coffee cup / water bottle and my Baby's bottle.<br />+ Attaches very well to the stroller !<br />+ Matches well with the Black or any dark color strollers.<br />+ So worth the price. Not ripoff expensive like branded stroller accessories !<br />+ Just love it ! I am sure you wont regret the purchase at all.
Baby,5.0,PERFECT GIFT,PURCHASED THIS FOR A LITTLE BOY THAT HAS A COWBOY THEMED NURSERY. HE LOVES THIS TOY. I'M A BIG FAN OF ALL THE LAMAZE TOYS BUT THIS ONE IS SUPER CUTE!!!
Baby,5.0,very entertaining mobile,Bought this for my 12 week old and wish I had gotten it sooner. He loves staring at it and it instantly calms him. His older sister (18 month) now wants to hang out in his crib to look at the mobile too and his twin sister prefers his crib to hers now too. I'm buying this again for my parents house and anywhere else my children spend a lot of time at.
Baby,5.0,Well worth it!,My wife bought it for our 3 month old so that she can entertained in the crib.  My daughter was delighted to listen to the music as the jungle animals go around and around.  It has different music settings to keep them entertained.  It definitely grabs their attention.
Baby,1.0,Listen to the all the BAD reviews!,"I just bought this mobile for my 2 month old daughter who loves to watch any kind of toys, but she really gets excited when they are toys that move. She also loves music and is attracted to lights as well. We have a stationary mobile that spins when you wind it up that matches her crib set, but she liked the movement so much I got tired of winding it up every 3 minutes. (She cries when it stops!) I researched alot of reviews on mobiles, and decided to give this one a shot giving that most of the reviews were good, and the other rainforest collection has a pretty good track record of good reviews.<br /><br />Man am I disappointed. I got the mobile yesterday, gave it fresh batteries, put it on the crib, got the baby, turned it on....the baby barely noticed it was there!!! The music is super quiet. It's honestly so quiet that if the baby cries or someone is talking in the same room, you can't hear it at all. The light is VERY dim, not bright enough to catch my little one's attention. Lastly, but not at all least, the mobile moves slower than an ox! It's honestly ridiculous. The wind up mobile moves quicker when wound! I read the bad reviews and I thought I could live with quiet music and dim lights, but as long as the mobile worked well my little one would be fascinated. But no, it moves so slow that she gets bored within 5 seconds. The biggest problem like another one star rater mentioned is that the leaves slow it down trying to constantly rise and fall, and they catch on the animals everytime the animals pass which slows it down because it gets stuck for a few seconds. Terribly designed product in every way.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, this product isn't even worth the price to ship it to your home. This sounds harsh, but I am a real mom telling you the honest truth.<br /><br />I will say that I had the The First Years - Nature Sensations Dreams In Sight Mobile when my daughter was a baby, almost 4 years ago, and it is still being sold currently, and this mobile did work great for us.us."
Baby,3.0,Wish they had some stretch to them!,"My almost 5 month old loves these! I think they could have been made better.  They don't stretch so it's difficult to put these on. They aren't like other booties, socks, etc. that are made with the contours of feet in mind but rather a long \\""tube-like\\"" cover for your baby's foot. Plus, I think they are a little too short in length.  Without any stretch to them, they tend to ride down my baby's foot and eventually come off.  It gets annoying to constantly be putting them back on or adjusting them frequently.  These could be really great but have room for improvement."
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Mobile by Fisher Price,"My grandson loves this mobile. The music is well done and the forest sounds are soothing.  We have not used the remote control as of yet, but it's got to be a handy feature when the child is older and you don't want to be seen."
Baby,2.0,Not great,"I've used this product for only 5 months with our Chicco lightweight stroller, and the metal band that goes around the top snapped in half and pokes out. It still mostly keeps it shape, but I'll probably have to throw it out when my child is old enough to reach it b/c it's a hazard for little fingers."
Baby,5.0,A must have!!,"There were so many mobiles available- and we chose to get the Rainforest Peek-A-Boo.  We are so happy we did!  There are two levels of music- and with the higher setting you can hear it across the room- so it is plenty loud- as you want relaxing noise and don't want baby to stay awake.  My daughter has made friends with all of the animals and giggles with delight at them for a long time- it is easy to leave her in the crib an additional 20 minutes while getting ready in the morning because the mobile will entertain her.  There are four sound settings to chose from- the natural sounds (my husband likes to think of it as camping) and the soft music for the other.  The mobile can be turned off and the music plays only, or just the mobile.  The light is soft as you don't want it to keep baby awake- it is the perfect light for when our daughter is getting tired.  Not to mention the remote that can be used to restart the mobile if it stops...  We are so happy we decided to go with this one- the colors, sounds, and lights are perfect for our daughter."
Baby,5.0,make a wish,I purchased the Buggy Buddy for my daughter's wheel chair.  We are going to Chicago for her Make A Wish Trip and it will be a big help.  I fits very well on her wheelchair handle and is quite sturdy.  I will recommend this to my friends.  Thank you
Baby,5.0,love the nature sounds,I chose this mobile to go with frog themed nursery. I love the sounds that it has with it.  The nature sound is my sons favorite sound to sleep to.  It is on the quite side and you cannot hear the motors at all.<br /> I've had it running for a week and love it. The remote works great also so you don't have to walk beside the crib and risk waking the baby.<br />You might need some help putting it together it's not hard to assemble but it's easier to have help.
Baby,2.0,"Baby loves the crinkly one, but they don't stay on",These woukd be great if the material had any stretchiness...they simply will not stay on--they are not even socklike (shaped like a foot).
Baby,4.0,excellent,I love the music options but only wish that the music would cycle through all the styles instead of just one selection at a time. Baby doesn't notice and still loves the music after the mobile part has been removed.
Baby,5.0,Totally what our Citi Micro Needed....,I wish the cup holders were just a bit bigger for large drinks.  Sometimes I feel like I have to squeeze the drink in there but I guess that's also why it works.  Can't complain for the money.  It does exactly what it should and doesn't interfer with the fold on our City Micro.
Baby,1.0,Listen to the reviews!,"I read the reviews about this product having defects and not working appropriately after a short time. I thought maybe it was only a select few and would give it a try. When we received it and set it up on the first day I was so impressed. It is gorgeous, soothing, and visually stimulating. My 3 month old son LOVED it! Everything about this mobile was awesome. Music, sounds, movement, etc. And then....it stopped working the next day. We tried new batteries(again) but that wasn't the problem. The lights continue to play and the sound works fine, but the mobile will not spin unless you manually stimulate the leaves. Even then it will make only 1 rotation and stop. Then you have to stimulate it again. It broke my heart to have to send it back, but if I pay for a product I expect it to work properly and I don't have the time or patience to be the mobile's human motor :-("
Baby,5.0,Great parent cup/keys holder for little money!,"I was looking for a for something like this for my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller. I looked at their branded option for nearly $30 and only so-so reviews. Being frugal, I was on the hunt for something less expensive that would get the job done. The Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory is great. It is a heavy duty fabric that can basically stand up on end although it can be flattened as it arrived that way in the packaging. The cup holders will hold a pop can or a water bottle just fine. And I love the space in the middle for anything extra you would need to bring. There is a zipped mesh little pocket in the inside as well that I didn't know it had before purchasing. It would be perfect to put a house key in or a few dollars, etc. I was worried how it might hang from the City Mini and if I could easily get things in and out of it. The velcro straps are very long and you can adjust how high or low you would want it to sit as well as where on the handle bars you would want it to be. The ONLY drawback is the logo printed on the outside. It is rather obnoxious. The design isn't very professional or modern and it's big with colors that aren't very 'today'. I am a graphic designer so I think that is the only reason it bugs me. I will either hang it backwards on the stroller or even put black tape over it. It is just one of my hang ups, I guess. This is going to get the job done and I'm happy about it's affordable price tag. I highly recommend the purchase of this accessory."
Baby,5.0,Great Addition to my Stroller,"I bought this because my stroller (City Mini) did not come with a cup holder.  Initially I thought I could live without it, but once I got moving I decided that I really needed one.  I looked at different models online and scoped out the other strollers in the neighborhood-at the park, the bus stop, farmers markets, and saw that many of them were using the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy.  I wanted something to hold drinks, keys, and other essentials so that I did not have to take my purse along on every single walk.      It was definitely the best price compared to other brands/models. I am able to carry all of my stuff around without spilling or losing anything.  The cup holder sections hold everything from a take out coffee cup (hot or cold 16-20oz), water bottle (I usually have a camelback 24oz bottle), or a baby bottle without spilling or falling out.  I also like the inside zippered pocket I can stash my keys, phone, and a few $$ in there while we are out walking.        It does attach with velcro so I do need to readjust it on my stroller handlebar every few weeks, but that is easy enough!  Definitely a great product and fantastic price I would highly recommend it for any other City Mini owners."
Baby,3.0,Way too quiet...,I decided to get this mobile because it is very cute and matches my sons decor. It functions awesome and the battery life is very good. My only problem is that you can not even hear this mobile in the same room with it on. My son loves to hear music and loves to watch the mobile move so we had to buy another small toy that plays music for him.
Baby,5.0,Lovet it,Especially good for umbrella strollers. I bought it for my mclauren quest sport model. Also elastic.. Very useful. I reccomend for all kind of umbrella strollers..
Baby,4.0,Baby Loves This,"This is a fantastic mobile, I am so glad we registered for it. It matches the soother, play gym and jumperoo we got. We are pleased with all these rainforest items because our baby loves them. This mobile keeps her attention. There are several classical music  choices and nature sounds. I like the remote control feature because I can switch it on from my bed. I wish it projected light on the ceiling like others do, because then we would be able to use it longer and our baby loves lights. It can be used as a music box and night light when she gets too big, but it would be nicer if it projected light to the ceiling. All in all, we are very happy with this."
Baby,5.0,handy,I have a limited of cup holder space on the stroller. This thing works perfectly. I can be putting my drink from the coffee shop or a bottle of water and it hold well. It is very stable with the metal frame. Can hold many items. Very useful product.
Baby,1.0,Worked TWICE before breaking!,"I was so excited to get this mobile because it was adorable in the pictures. BUT after the arduous task of putting it all together and attaching it to the crib, we turned it on and the mobile DID spin... but slowly. After using this mobile TWICE the motor in the mobile has broken and it WILL NOT TURN OR SPIN. I am OUTRAGED. The music works fine but it won't spin! What is the point of having a mobile that doesn't spin?!"
Baby,2.0,"Looks Nice, Not Built Well",I got this to go on my Skip Hop Duo bag. I thought it was cute and I liked that I could clip it on to the bag so that I could find it quickly and also so it could hang outside of the bag to save room when I had a lot in the diaper bag. When I first got it I was surprised at how easily the red part that opens to dispense the wipes just comes off. I decided to just open the whole case to avoid breaking this piece. Today I went to take it off of the bag so I could fill it up and the snap broke off. I have had this less than a month and only clipped it on to the bag once so it can't be from excessive wear and tear.
Baby,5.0,citi mini double,"I bought two for my citi mini double, and I'm so glad I did!  It's great, and it's way cheaper than the one made to go with my stroller.  I bought two of these for 2/3 the price of ONE from baby jogger!  Love it.  The insulation is great too; the ice in my water bottles doesn't melt as fast on long walks around the lake because of it.  And I don't even have to take them off to fold the stroller.  They are also great because I can take one off and put it on my Uppa Baby Gluxe stroller if I want."
Baby,2.0,cute but pointless,"These are cute little wrist rattles, but my baby couldn't care less about them. We got them before she was born and she is about 4 months now. We've tried them repeatedly, always thinking maybe she just needed to be in the right developmental stage to enjoy them, but so far, nothing. Wouldn't bother with them if I had it to do over."
Baby,5.0,My Baby Loves These!,My baby loves these contrast wrist bugs. I believe they contributed to my baby finding his hands so early.  Love them love them!
Baby,5.0,Perfect for a wheelchair too,"This pouch is perfect for the arm of a wheelchair. Its great for attaching when I go to the mall..to hold a drink or other things. I dont mind being a \\""sunshine kid\\""     And it much less expensive than the one produced for the handicap. Those are overpriced which is par for accessibility items"
Baby,2.0,wish I would have paid attention to the reviews,"Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating."
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT!!!!,My daughters room theme is monkeys. So this was a must to have!!!! I will have to order another one soon.  Seeming this one is my daughters favorite one!! Fast shipping!!
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller Accessory,I purchased this to go with my Graco IPO Stroller-Platinum since the stroller does not have cup holders and Amazon recommended that other people purchased this product along with the stroller. I think it is definitely a must have. My husband and I loved the fact that we had two cup holders and a place to put our camera and other snack goodies as we walked around Disneyland and Sea World. It worked out and had so much space. Also everytime we had to fold the stroller to get on the tram or train we did not have to remove the accessory it fit perfectly that when we folded our stroller it did not get in the way. I would recommend this to anyone who does not have a cup holdr on their stroller. Also it did not get in the way of my baby bag which we hang from the stroller handles as well.
Baby,3.0,ouchies,The dragon has a rattle that hangs from the hand....originally I really liked all the features but when baby is shaking the toy vigorously this rattle turns into more of a mace and hits really hard. We had to cut it off for safety reasons. After we cut it off we love the toy. The mirror on the tail is my daughters favorite component....I just feel that I shouldn't have to butcher a toy to make it safe.
Baby,5.0,I LOVE it!,This product is a must-buy! I originally recieved this as a gift when pregnant with my son...he is now 14 months old and has a little sis on the way and STILL loves watching and playing with this mobile!     There are two volume settings for the tunes which are perfectly set. Of the two volume settings one is set to be fairly quiet for nighttime and napping and then there is the higher setting for playtime. The animals are very vibrant in color and the moving leaves are adorable. There is also a night light setting as well. You also have the option of 3 sets of tunes or rainforest nature noises. This is truly a wonderful item that I recommend for everyone whether it matches the theme of the room or not. My son absolutely loved watching all of the moving animals and leaves...I would joke that he thought going to bed was playtime because he would get so excited to see his mobile. Excellent item!
Baby,5.0,LOVE THIS,"My daughter is 4 months old and adores this giraffe.  He's probably one of her favorites.  It holds up well in the wash - just keep in mind that throwing it in the dryer will ruin the mirror.  If your child likes the crinkle noise, the underside of this is crinkle."
Baby,5.0,Works great,"The accessory attaches easily to the Peg Perego Si stroller.  It holds fountain drinks without spilling.  Very convenient for keys, etc."
Baby,5.0,Works great on the City Mini,"We bought this instead of the $30 Baby Jogger brand for our City Mini stroller.  So glad we saved the money and went with this one instead.  It works perfectly - has 2 cup holders, a zippered pouch and space in the middle for keys, cell phone, wallet, water bottle and whatever else you need to have with you.  Definitely a good buy!"
Baby,5.0,I wish I had one above my bed,"My baby just loves this mobile.  He first started to really notice it at about 3 weeks or so, and it's still a hit at 8 weeks.  We'll lay him in his crib to change his clothes, and he'll just stare at it in fascination.  He'll be so involved that we often just leave him there, where he kicks his legs and moves his arms and \\""speaks\\"" to it.  It occupies him on average for about 20 minutes.  From my own perspective, I just love the colors and the animals.  They're so happy and lively.  The underside of the green, flapping leaves is an iridescent green (which adults may not notice, unless they bend over to see it from the angle of the baby.) These fabric leaves almost haphazardly flap (by design) but always manage to not mess anything up.  They often tap the animals, and help the movement seem a little more lively.  Regarding the music, I suspect it's great for the baby, but I find the songs to be a little slow and monotone for my taste. (Slower and less lively than the actual versions of the Bach/Beethoven/Mozart songs.) Thankfully, there is also a nature sounds option, which I usually choose.<br /><br />EDIT<br />My baby is now 23-months and he still loves this mobile, but now HE gets to be in charge of it since he can push the buttons.  It's basically part of his crib toys now.  Some reviewers complained that this eats batteries, but I've seen the exact opposite.  In 23 months (of almost daily use), I've had to change the batteries twice.  Also, when the batteries run down, the mobile moves really slowly, so there's nothing physically wrong with the mobile.  New batteries fix that problem immediately."
Baby,5.0,MUST have for PUMPING MOM'S who use AVENT bottles.,"GO GREEN and store your breastmilk in your AVENT bottles.  Save time too!  I was using the milk bags, and other than what I freeze, I use the milk pumped at work from the previous day for the next day's milk at the daycare or at home with dad.  I was not being very eco friendly by using and wasting so many bags, not to mention the costs.  I didn't want to buy new bottles, and the bottles that came with my pump didn't fit in my bottle bag well.  These discs were exactly what I needed.  They are not available at BRU or at Target, the stores I frequent.  Thank you Amazon for carrying them!"
Baby,5.0,EXCELLENT!!!,I switched to an umbrella stroller without any kind of basket and this works perfectly!! Holds everything nice and ready at hand.
Baby,5.0,Works great on my Joovy Caboose,"I got this for my Joovy Caboose Sit and Stand and it is perfect!  About a third of the price of the Joovy parent organizer (sorry Joovy, I love you but this is way cheaper).  Love the double cup holder and the middle compartment is perfect for phone, keys, camera, etc.  A great, affordable little organizer that fits my needs."
Baby,5.0,Makes it so easy!,I had no idea that Avent even made something like this until I happened upon them on Amazon. When daddy watches our daughter he was clueless as how to set up her bottles and this made it easy for me to make them in the morning and store them in the fridge until he needed them. not to mention I can stuff a bottle in the diaper bag with formula and top it off with a sealing disk so the formula doesn't get stuck in the nipple before I feed her. So nice to have!
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"I bought this when I was 5mos pregnant and my baby is 20mos now.<br /><br />From the first night that we came home with her, till now, I am using this music player pleasantly. Nowadays, my baby is pushing buttons by herself and trying to sleep alone.<br /><br />I wish there are more music and the music goes longer than 20 minutes.<br />Also, the remote works during in few minutes after the player turned off. I hope the remote works all the time.<br /><br />But overall, I love this so much and my baby too."
Baby,3.0,Not to my baby's taste,I must say that this is good but just that I introduced it too late to my baby when she was 3 months old.  She was not very interested in it but this could be just her - am sure this is more useful for newborns.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,My 3 month old loves it!  He will even talk to it when it is not spinning around. I only wish there were more than one way to attach it as it fits his crib but only fits the side rail and not the back. The push button remote is nice too.
Baby,5.0,Does its job,"This secures well to the stroller, holds a nice amount and it seems well made.  I use it on my City Mini stroler - it fits well both on the single and on the double."
Baby,4.0,Peaceful,My daughter who is four months old loves to look up at this. The music is great not to loud and peaceful. I'm very pleased with this mobile.
Baby,5.0,Holds everything I need!,"Holds just about everything I need when walking with my Baby Jogger City Elite stroller (which doesn't have a cup holder, and I didn't want to spend $20 on one). This buggy buddy for $9 is so much better than any expensive cup holder! Mine did come with a HUGE unnecessary annoying label on the inside of it, but I just cut it out and now it's perfect!"
Baby,5.0,"Great Mobile, Stimulates my Baby","My daughter is 3.5 months now and I am so happy we have this mobile.  She absolutely loves it, we'll put her in her crib and turn it on and she'll be so happy staring at it while listening to the music, kicking her feet and smiling.  If she's fussy, we'll put her in there and it will calm her down.  The mobile will buy us time in the morning if we need it, as she just loves to look at it.  We don't use it at night, as this doesn't seem to put her to sleep, perhaps it's too stimulating for her.  But in any case, we love it, it's great and I highly recommend it for any new parent!!"
Baby,5.0,Love it...Worth the price!!!,"My 2 month old loves this mobile. Everyday in the morning hours he loves to play with this, he feels so happy looking at the animals. He screams and shouts in happiness. Me and my husband feel so good about the mobile. Especially we love the remote and start the music when it switches off, from the bed itself. There are not many features in the remote, it just switches off or on, but literally that's all u need. Simple is sweet! The music is very soothing. I would highly recommend this product and it is definitely worth the money."
Baby,3.0,Regret Not Getting A Better One,"I gave it 3 stars because what I feel is wrong with it, is just my personal preference.  It didn't break, it's comfy, and it's easy to set up.  I bought this item based on price, having compared other small and inexpensive gyms with it.  I saw that the info said that the hanging toys are attached by velcro, and it didn't occur to me that meant I couldn't add toys to it without some fanagling (making my own loops to add).  I'm disappointed with the tiger--he looks really cute, but he's very hard plastic, and it wasn't easy for my son to get the music to play for the first 2 months of use (at 3 mo.+). The only way to get the music to play, is if the ball it's holding gets \\""rolled\\"" between its paws.  This is the only noise-making item on the gym, except for the roller ball at the foot pad.  Now that he can consistently make the tiger play music (5 mo.), he's really getting too big for the whole gym.  I also wish that I would have chosen one that has travel closures, but I knew ahead of time that this one did not.  So my opinion of flaws are: no loops to attach your own toys, not enough/easy enough interactive items, and no travel closures.  One thing that I added to make it more fun is the Infantino chime animals:  [[ASIN:B00494CKIS Infantino Tag Along Chimes, Frog and Duck]]  The loop on those fit perfectly around the bar."
Baby,4.0,CUTE,I GOT THIS BEFORE I KNEW I WAS HAVING A GIRL BECUASE ITS NEUTRAL. LOVE IT BUT HOW IS MY BABY SUPPOST TO SEE IT AT NIGHT. I FOUND THE PACKAGE PICTURE TO BE MISS LEADING IT SHOWED THE LEAVES TO HAVE LIGHTS. NOT. SHE LOVES IT BUT LOOSES INTREST FAST. REMOTE GOOD IDEA WHEN IT WORKS AND ONLY ONE COLOR LIGHTS ON MUSIC BOX PAID ALOT FOR THIS TOO NOT HAVE IT ALL. GOOD OTHER WISE. WORTH A BUY IF YOU HAVE A NIGHT LIGHT FOR BABY TO SEE STUFFED ANIMALS MOVE.
Baby,4.0,Works with baby jogger city select,"I got this for our Baby Jogger City Select. It works great as long as we aren't using the car seat adapter. There is enough room for my drink and son's sippy cup, my keys, wallet and cell phone."
Baby,5.0,great first toy and baby sleeping aid!,"My baby loves it and  goes to sleep with the rain forest sounds, and plays when the other classical music is playing.  There are no down sides because  it has been over four years and it still looks great and  my kids love to play  with  it ."
Baby,4.0,Good Product - wish it had higher volume,"Nice product - very cute.  However it has only 2 volume sets. The low one is very low (can barely hear) and the high volume set is what I would consider \\""Low\\"" to \\""Medium\\""...  other mobiles & soothers I've got have higher volume.  My baby just pays attention to it when he's quiet.  When he's crying no-one can hear the \\""High\\"" volume set from this mobile, unfortunately."
Baby,5.0,Works great with the BOB stroller,"We are using this with our BOB stroller. It fits a standard size water bottle or cup very easily and is perfect for storing a few essentials. And, the best part is that it is so much cheaper and more practical than the BOB version."
Baby,5.0,Great snack caddy.,"We bought this to fit our Radio Flyer ATW wagon (the one with the wooden sides) and this fits on great!  The velcro is super strong and long enought to fit tight or be a bit more loose (for larger handles, etc).  The elastic cup holders are strong and large enough to hold a Kids Camelbak bottle.  The center compartment is very multi-functional.  Once the compartment is full, it's really difficult to access the zipper pouch.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a portable snack caddy."
Baby,4.0,Bright and fun,"My son absolutely loves this mobile.  He'll stare up at the faces of the little creatures (a lizard, parrot, monkey, and bug) and giggle like crazy, it's hilarious to watch.<br /><br />What I really love about it is that it's super bright and colorful; my son has no trouble focusing on it at 4 months old.  It was also easy to put together and simple to attach to the crib.  The music box part plays 18 minutes of classical tunes and its volume settings seem adequate to me.<br /><br />The mobile portion is detachable for when baby doesn't need that bit anymore, and the music box has a nightlight (not too bright) which has proven useful.<br /><br />All in all I love this product and definitely recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Adorable.,Dee Dee is adorable. I love her and my daughter does too! I have the princess and the moose too. All are equally adorable but each are a little different so it's fun to change them up. Easy to take with us and to play with at home. I would highly recommend the dragon!
Baby,5.0,It is a must have!,"Very pleased with this product. Baby's cup, my cup, phone, wallet, keys....I don't have to dig in the bottom of my bag anymore. So busy Moms, messy Moms, don't like to carry lot-a-stuff Moms it was invented for us!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable!,I bought this for my baby girl because my husband and I were looking at Lamaze toys for her before she was born. I happened upon a listing for this little dragon and just HAD to get it (my husband LOVES dragons hehe)and she loves it!!! She's been playing with this for months now and at 6.5 months it's still one of her favorite toys.
Baby,5.0,Amazed by the quality.,"This is an exceptionally well made product. Durable quality. Although it is sold as a stroller accessory, I purchased it to use on my TiLite wheelchair. Couldn't work better if it had been custom designed. Hanging from the frame below the seat and behind my knees, this caddy holds a water bottle, eyeglasses, cellphone, medication, gloves, and tissues all within easy reach. The wire frame sewn into the fabric keeps the same shape whether empty or full, allowing for good visibility and easy access without having to fumble around inside a pouch or bag. Excellent product."
Baby,5.0,great for babies,"i have no comments that could take away from these Lamaze toys.  all of the different sensory points on this one is great - squeaker in the knight, crinkle & stripes in the hooves, jingle in the head, tags all over, and rings that clang together (and according to my baby are wonderful to chew on) make this such a useful developmental toy!  we also purchased Jacques the Peacock and Eddie the Elephant who i had hoped my baby would've enjoyed because they were all so cute but this horse was his favorite."
Baby,5.0,Sunshine kids universal console vs Baby Jogger universal console,So I have a Baby Jogger City Mini. I bought both this parent console as well as the baby jogger one and tried them both out. I'm keeping this one. The other one just doesn't seem to be that much better. With shipping and all this one was less than $15....and the other was about $31.  I would say that if you are going to want to fold your stroller up with out emptying every little item out of the stroller you should get the baby jogger console. I do like that I can just toss stuff in this one without paying to much attention.  There is a small mesh zippered pocket on the inside of the largest section....very small. The cup holders are very accommodating. With some effort I got a really secure fit and nothing sloshes out of my cup.  They both have advantages and disadvantages. They are both really well made products out of nice material. It's just a style issue and how you will personally use it.
Baby,5.0,Triplets Loved Mobile,We bought three of these for our triplet infants (one for each crib) and they absolutely loved them.  The color scheme and the animals were very cute and kept the babies entertained. We did not use the remote control provided at all.    The kids enjoyed falling asleep to the night light.
Baby,5.0,great product,"bought this for my grandson, only 7 months old, he loves playing with they, nice bright colors, really keep him occupied"
Baby,5.0,Mommy,"My daughter, she loves this musical mobile. It has long music also has a light. it has a remode for you to turn on and off music. I love this."
Baby,1.0,don't waste your time,"This product was a dissapointment.  The motor worked for about 15 minutes, then died.  The sounds worked fine, but FisherPrice really dropped the ball and used the cheapest, weakest motor they possibly could.  This was a big waste of time and money on all sides of the Amazon equation.  I will hesitate before ever buying a FisherPrice item again."
Baby,5.0,Get's the job done at a much lower price,"I originally purchased this stroller accessory for a light weight stroller, but ended up using it for my high end jogging stroller. It works ok on the light weight stroller but fits the larger jogging stroller better. I was glad to have had ordered this at such a low price versus the name brand stroller accessory ranging between $25-$30. I love that you can fit sports bottles and baby bottles alike in the two beverage compartments, and appreciate the small zipper in the main compartment  you can keep keys, ID's and even a slim phone safely secure). Overall this a great product at an affordable price."
Baby,4.0,love it,"Our son is breast fed and pacifiers are not something he seemed to enjoy. We purchased this one as it was similar to the one from the hospital only it has the monkey attached. The weight of the monkey helps keep the pacifier in his mouth, he sucks on this pacifier more than any of the other ones of the same type we've tried. The animal attached to it is a good idea since it really does help keep the pacifier in his mouth."
Baby,5.0,Very handy,"This is a great wipes case. I can just pull it out when I pull out the changing pad and leave it attached to my diaper bag so I don't forget it. It's also helpful to have it attached so I can keep one hand on the baby and pull wipes out one at a time. I like the sliding button to open the container, this makes it very easy to use with one hand as well."
Baby,5.0,Baby's favorite toy,My son loves these high contrast wrist rattles.  They are great for attaching to either his wrists or the car seat handle.  It was the first toy he reached for!
Baby,5.0,Goodgood,"We had it foe my ds1 3yrs ago n he loved it. When we my ds2 arrived, i decided to get it for him too~~"
Baby,5.0,My twins love it!,I looked around at a lot of mobiles before making this purchase.  I wanted something bright that I didn't have to hand crank.  I know people have comments about the sound but really the babies don't need it very loud.  At first my daughter wasn't a fan but now she loves it.  And my son likes one type of music and my daughter the other.  Every kid is different so try the different options for music.  And it has lights!  Love it.  I am so glad I made this purchase.  I was well worth it and way less than the silly hand crank ones.  Definitely recommend it!
Baby,5.0,Great little case,"I came on here to order a second case because I love the first so much. The first is staying in my diaper bag, the second will be for my changing table to hold wipes when I buy them in big bulk bags. I saw some reviews that said the big red button didn't slide. I was disappointed by that at first too, until I realized it's actually a very smart design where if you push down on one side of the button while sliding it, it unlocks it. The button is supposed to be locked in place when it's closed to prevent it from accidentally sliding open and drying out the wipes. It is a bit bulky, but it also holds a lot of wipes. I haven't had any problems with it popping open or the snap coming undone. I love this thing!"
Baby,5.0,Working well so far on Joovy Caboose stroller,"I got this for $9 on Amazon.com and it's working well on my Joovy Caboose stroller.  I like that it's not too bulky so that my 4-1/2 year old daughter can still sit or stand on the back of the stroller and get in and out without upsetting the contents of the holder.  I put my tall Contigo water bottle in it and it was very stable and doesn't tip over even though it looked off balance.  My water bottle goes in one pocket and my daughter's goes in the other with room for wallet, camera, phone, and keys in the center.  I definitely like the two water bottle separators and I also like the mesh and zip pockets for the phone and keys.  Overall, it's great so far.  In writing the review today I noticed the pricing says $16.99.  I don't think it's worth that much and not sure why the sellers have it priced there.  Maybe I got lucky.  Hope the price comes down.  I wouldn't pay more than $12 for it."
Baby,5.0,rainforest peek-a-boo Musical Mobile,"This mobile is beautiful, well worth the good price on it. The music is very soothing for a baby and my great grandson loves it.."
Baby,5.0,Holds everyting I need perfectly!,"I love this! The price is exceptional for the product. It has very strong velcro that will not come off! It holds two drinks of various sizes and the middle area is a great size for a cell phone, keys, wipes, etc. I am so glad I ordered this and did not spend $30 on the City Mini version!"
Baby,5.0,"Thanks Amazon, it's the greatest infant mobile I have ever seen or used.",My grandson loves this mobile.  So many people have asked me where to buy it.  I may even keep it after all the kids are gone because it is very soothing to me also.
Baby,3.0,Does ok.,"I attached this to my McClaren stroller. It does well except when you fold the stroller. the top has a metal ring built in, I'm sure it's for stability. But if you don't detach it from one side, it bends and you have to bend it back every time.<br />I remember to detach one side... unfortunately, my mom and my husband don't. It'll probably break eventually."
Baby,4.0,Works well,"This is perfect to hold sippy cups, keys, or other small things.  I have the Baby Jogger which does not have any space to keep these types of things in.  It works great with the stroller.  I keep it on and it does not get in the way of folding/ unfolding the stroller.  I would recommend this."
Baby,2.0,Doesn't fit on my crib,"This looks like a very nice product, but the bracket to attach it to the crib didn't fit on our crib.  Its small and leaves only a narrow space for the railing it sits on.  If you have a convertible crib with a thick top railing this probably won't work for you.  Instead we got the Fisher Price Precious Planet mobile with the projection, which attaches with straps and is more flexible to the size of your crib."
Baby,5.0,great,great product for babies just about to find their feet. baby loves to watch her feet. and they wash in machine well.
Baby,4.0,Good Price/Quality/Entertainment Ratio,"We purchsed the FP Rainforest Peek-A-Boo for our 5 month old and he enjoys it quite a bit. The combination of sound/music and movement is quite good. I am very happy with it and honestly for the price it was the best one out there. And you can take the mobile off later and just use the music/sound part. Only drawback is that the nightlight part feels like it was added into the design later so it doesn't fit the overall appeal of the Rainforest motif. Anyway I would recommend it and the baby loves it so hey, I am happy."
Baby,5.0,Love it.,My son loves this mobile.  The music selections are soothing and play long enough without me worrying about restarting it again.  This is definitely one of the better baby purchases I have made.
Baby,4.0,Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"Easy and cool. Does what it supposed to do. The only con is that on my Uppa Baby Vista it tends to slip down on the rails and it hangs with an angle, not completely vertical, but not too bad. Its not a problem for your drinks!"
Baby,5.0,LOVE this mobile!!!,"I ordered two of these after my twin sons showed interest in the fisher price rainforest bouncer. That is a great item too, by the way!! The mobile is AWESOME! We love it, great sounds, many options (just movement, movement w/light, movement w/music, etc.) and the remote is handy if your baby wakes up and you want to soothe him back to sleep without him seeing you and fully waking. I would definitely recommend!!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy even at 2 months!,"We just purchased this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She may only be 2 months old, but she gets mesmerized by it. The sounds make her laugh and she gets very excited when you click the keys together. When I hold them close to her she tries very hard to reach out and play with them. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially over real keys which contain pretty high levels of lead in them. I learned that after my first born was 4 months old. Fisher Price Musical Teether Keys Toy is a great buy!"
Baby,1.0,boring...,Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
Baby,3.0,Great item,"Works much better and longer than the wind up mobiles. Wish it was longer than 10min because my daughter will start to cry when it stops. Like others have mentioned, the volume is low."
Baby,5.0,great product. kiddo loves it.,"This gym was a great purchase. Doesn't make noise every single time you touch it, so it doesn't get annoying, but plenty to keep their attention. Very durable, too. The dogs tear across it and hasn't shown any wear. Had it for about 3 months, love it."
Baby,5.0,Love Love Love!,"Our son loves this thing! It really has helped him grab on and hold things better and quicker. He is able to actually play with it and get it back in his mouth at 3 months old. Esp like the monkey. It is super soft and washes nicely. We have the elephant too, but do not prefer the material on it."
Baby,1.0,Broke in less than a minute!,"My 4.5 year old son was beyond excited to get this.  He told everyone he saw today about his toy bow and arrow coming in the big brown truck.  He watched out the window for an hour.  It came, I read the instructions, I put it together properly.  He put an arrow in, pulled back (harder then needed, but seriously, he's 4--it wasn't THAT hard!) and the wood broke in half.  Poof. That fast. He is still crying after 30 minutes.  The arch is made of two thin/flat pieces pf unfinished plywood.  I almost got a splinter when putting it together, by the way.  Just bending it into shape I was worried I was going to break it.  We generally buy wood options over plastic, but in this case, we're returning this and buying plastic!"
Baby,5.0,great!,"Wonderful product! I use it with both my Bugaboo and my Graco snap n go and its great, it holds everything I need Pacifiers bottles ect and doesnt get in the way when I fold my carriage! also very easy to take on and off but still very secure, strong velcro."
Baby,4.0,Much better than the Ibert,We borrowed the ibert from a friend to see if we'd like it. It was ok however there are some major flaws. The ibert DOES NOT fit on male mountain bikes. We tried on 2 different mountain bikes (specialized and another brand) and on both it was impossible to put on. Also the ibert makes it difficult to steer and the kids can mess with your gears.   This was much better than the ibert. It's really easy to install and fit perfectly on my husbands mountain bike. The seat does look ridiculously small but both my child (1.5 years old) and his cousin who is 2.5 years old fit perfectly in it. They are both of average weight and height for their age so I think this could easily fit a 3-4 year old. If you are short this seat might not work for you as my husband who is 5'9 bikes slightly bow legged with this seat but is not uncomfortable.
Baby,1.0,Disappointed,"Well, we loved it at first, but then it broke after only using it for 2 weeks. The music still plays but the mobile doesn't turn anymore."
Baby,2.0,Not what I needed,"Well, I was so excited to get this, but unfortunately it does not work on my stroller.  I have 2 peg perrego strollers and it did not work on either one.  It is a nice addition if it fits.  It is sturdy enough for a drink and the middle compartment seems perfect to throw your keys or whatever in.  Too bad for me, I'm still looking!!"
Baby,4.0,"It's okay,  could be better",I ordered it for a Teutanio (sp) Euro style stroller. It doesn't fit well but works good enough for what I use the stroller for.
Baby,5.0,Great for mom's stuff,"Purchased this to go with sit and stand stroller since it didn't have a cup holder. This works great! I use it to hold my drink, bottle and keys. There is also room for kids snacks. Recommend to anyone who's stroller doesn't have a cup holder!"
Baby,1.0,DO NOT BUY,"Documentation is not clear, camera has short range and hence loses signal 2 rooms away or lags over 30 seconds. Their technical support is via customer support representative who basically acts as a proxy. App loses connection if you turn off your screen, which is a major failure point as a baby monitor.   Picture quality is amazing in a dark room but all the other issues are causing us to send it back."
Baby,5.0,Great caddy for my BabyJogger Summit XC,"It holds my wallet, cell phone, keys, bottle for baby and drink for me. That's just about all I can ask for! Way cheaper than buying the brand name accessory. I flipped it backwards so I don't see the decal and I don't miss it."
Baby,4.0,my baby loves it!,"I got this used from a local shop, and I have to say, it was totally worth it.  I suggest to other buyers out there, check your local craigslist postings and thrift shops for your baby items.  Alot of the stuff was used for a month or two, and is basically in new condition.    My daughter loves this playmat and is fascinated with all the toys.  The pillow seems a bit silly, but otherwise a wonderful purchase.  I love that you can re-arrange the way the toys are places since it doesn't hook together any specific way."
Baby,5.0,Absolutely one of the best products of all-time!,"This is seriously one of my favorite products, and the most useful, that I've ever bought.  Ours is now several years old and I rotate it amongst my strollers, so that I have it on the stroller that I'm going to be using that day.  It just occurred to me that I should really buy a second one!  I live in Paris (France, not Texas :-)), and very often someone will ask me where I bought it because it's unusual here!  I like that it can go on any type of stroller handlebar, since we have both kinds--a bar across and separate handles--and the velcro is still holding up though I attach & detach it frequently.  I also like that the cup holder partitions are flexible, so that if I want to put something \\""big\\"" in the center pocket, and only have one drink that day instead of two, the partition can fold the other way and the center space is bigger.  I really recommend this product, and can't say enough good things about it."
Baby,4.0,Worked great,"Bought this to use with the Dream On Me double umbrella stroller, and it worked great.  No problems with the cup holders, and room for random stuff."
Baby,4.0,works OK with uppababy,"I bought this to go with my uppababy vista.  so far, it's been working well, though it's starting to slide down the handlebars a little, though.  I did go for an hour walk using the caddy with my water bottle, and had no problems.  it's pretty sturdy, but it does hang between the handles, so it moves a little when you walk.  I wouldn't put a cup of coffee in it if I couldn't seal the lid.  overall, I am very pleased with this caddy."
Baby,5.0,GREAT!!,"Love love this mobile! The colors are so vibrant and my son loves to stare at it. The music is also great, and I think the perfect volume. And the remote is awesome to re start it without your child seeing you!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent choice,Love it! Love it! Love it! And so does my son. I have had this for several months and haven't had one single problem.
Baby,1.0,Terrible- software is sub-standard,"The camera itself seems nice. The software is terrible. This is sold as a device for Apple iOS things- iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, but the computer software that comes with it is only for Windows. The iOS software has very few features. For starters, you can ONLY access this device if you are on a WiFi network- they make no accommodation for a lower-quality feed via 3G or other cellular data network standards. So, the box is misleading when it says you can access from anywhere. You can set alerts for motion or sound, however you must have the app running on your iOS device actively to receive the alert, so there goes your battery on the phone! I would have expected the alert to trigger an email or text. If you happen to have a windows machine or have windows on your mac, again, it must be on and running, and then their software is able to record, but the iOS app has no way of accessing that information from anywhere. And lastly, although it has \\""two-way sound\\"", it doesn't include any kind of speaker, so you must supply your own.<br /><br />It's a shame, because with decent software and better features on the iOS side, this could be a nice thing. Oh yeah- one more thing... the FAQ's provide a good laugh- they are poorly written, and seem as if they are a poor translation from another language into english, as many sentences in them actually make no sense at all such as: \\""How should I do when I bought a new camera?\\"" and \\""Why does the product agains the wall in the night there will be a strong white light?\\"" ... great job on Quality Control there!!!!! But, that about defines the overall quality of this solution. Definitely save your money for something better.<br /><br />This doesn't even deserve one star, but I can't select \\""0\\"" stars."
Baby,5.0,Works great on Baby Jogger City Select,"This organizer is excellent on the Baby Jogger City Select! Cup holder is a great size for multiple size cups, including standard to-go coffee. zipper pouch is good for small items like pacifiers. plenty of room in the main open area for cell phone, burp cloth, toy. It does not all zip closed so items will fall out if folding stroller. I really don't fold stroller all that much so this works great for me!"
Baby,5.0,"Fit great, and hold alot",This fit my City mini double perfectly and was a quarter the price of the Baby Jogger brand. The mesh zipper pocket is perfect for holding loose change and small bills while out and about running errands or around Disneyworld and the Zoo. We finally have a place to store the adult drinks and all the other things we carry along on days out.
Baby,5.0,bueno,"excellent product, very good quality, arrived in very good condition, 100% recommended a comprehensive kit for the price  my baby loves his bottles ..."
Baby,5.0,the best pacifier out there!,"these are the best pacifiers out there--and worth the $$$--they don't fall apart, easy for my baby to find and pick up--can be doubled as a toy---great for car rides--and they look adorable to boot!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent,"The Lamze toy line is excellent.  My son is 3 months old and he has been playing with Sir Prance A Lot as well as the Peacock for over a month.  The toys are bright, colorful, and the textures and sounds amuse him for 30 minutes at a time, mulitple times a day.  He prefers the Lamaze toys to all of his others."
Baby,3.0,"Kid likes it, but it's flawed","The three big leaves seem to slow down the rotation to the point of stopping movement all together even with brand new batteries.  Ended up needing to fashion something to keep the leaves up high permanently so that the inside ring of animals would continue to rotate without stopping.  My daughter does love it, though (as long as it doesn't stop on her)."
Baby,5.0,Works Perfect for Me!,"I picked this up on a whim while at the local mall for our new baby two weeks ago.  I had it up and running inside of 6 minutes, I downloaded the iPhone App, quickly connected to my WiFi network, (you will need to hard wire using the included cable for the initial setup). I then gave it a name, set up a password to connect and view the video feed and was ready to go. The camera does EXACTLY what they claim it does.  The pan function works great and audio has a slight delay but is expected over WiFi.  My wife can now keep an eye on the baby wherever she happens to be in the house. Works on our iPhones and iPads with no problems."
Baby,5.0,"Wonderfully entertaining, for us anyway!","I got three of these and they arrived today. My friend and I took them out of the plastic, and fell in love with all of them straight off. These are all three gifts for my granddaughter and for a child who is like a great nephew to me. I am certain the children will love these.  The baby boy is only going to be about 4 months old come Xmas and our granddaughter will be about 9 months. I just cannot imagine that these would not hold their attention so I'm doing the review now. The crinkle sound and the different textures plus the mirrors are just wonderful ideas. I do recommend this product and all of the others that they have in this line. As I find out more, like how the babies interact, I will update but, it holds the attention of one 47-year-old woman and a 62 year old as well, lol. Thanks!"
Baby,2.0,Sometimes works,"First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the monkey is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.    Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the monkey.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.  Third, the monkey is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the monkey doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the monkey into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place."
Baby,5.0,So Cute!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 9 week old son, so he won't really be able to appreciate it or use it for a few weeks yet. I can tell already though that it is very well made, and an attractive toy. I bought it after seeing how much my youngest nephew loves his Lamaze dragonfly, and I'm sure my son will love this just as much.<br />Great toy!"
Baby,5.0,My son's sleep aid for more than a year,"We got this as a mobile to entertain my son before he could roll over, and wound up keeping it until he was around 1.5 years old. He absolutely loved it, from start to finish. The mobile was calming for him, as was the music. After he was old enough to stand and get into trouble grabbing the mobile, we removed it but kept the musical base. That base was his lullaby every night for pretty much the whole time.<br /><br />The mobile slowly rotates when music is playing. The base is bulky, but attaches safely onto the rail of your crib with a (non-marring) screw-in pressure clamp. The mobile plays several different songs, but my son always wanted the same one.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ my son loved it! as a mobile when he was very young, and as a lullaby music box when he got older<br />+ buttons are accessible from the crib. The unit was mounted high enough he didn't hit the buttons on accident, but could turn it on to self-sooth in the middle of the night, if he wanted.<br />+ mobile is cute, and removeable, which extended its usable life for us.<br /><br />Con:<br />- the mounting hardware is a bit bulky. We had to keep the crib an extra inch or two away from the wall because of how long the large pressure screw was<br />- the whole thing is a bit big and bulky. This in general doesn't matter, but when we wanted to bring it with us on trips or on the airplane it took up lots of room. Probably not a consideration for most people :)<br /><br />Overall we were very happy with this mobile. We even took the base on trips with us to help our son feel comfortable wherever we happened to be traveling to, especially at night."
Baby,1.0,Doesn't work,"I bought this mobile, and we assembly all the parts with the batteries and it doesn't work. Also we read all the instructions, and we wrote an email to fisher price costumer service. Bad product, we don't recommended."
Baby,1.0,Gets boring,"My 5 month old liked this initially, but he's officially bored with it now.  I wish I would've bought a play mat with more hanging toys.  The 2 hanging toys are lame.  Spend a little more, buy something with more toys!"
Baby,4.0,Great Mobile for Twins,"Bought 2 sets of these mobiles for our twins.  Works great, keeps them in awe of the rotating animals and the leaves that wave up and down.  Good selection of sounds from Mozart, Bach, Bethoveen and Jungle; wish there were more."
Baby,3.0,"They are so cute, but don't fit on the feet","I bought these for our 3 month old granddaughter.  The bright colors really catch her attention, but the fabric is not like a sock and does not stretch.  We also bought the other set that has the solid color sock and those stretch and fit on the feet perfectly.  She still love the color and plays with them in her hand, but  not what they were made for."
Baby,5.0,Fun for infant-toddler,Great value and toy for my son who enjoyed this as an infant and still at 18 months likes to push the buttons and hear the music. He never used it much as a teether but has always loved the 3 musical buttons!Durable too.
Baby,5.0,Favorite Toy,This giraffe is my son's favorite toy so I had to write a review.  He is 12 weeks old now and just loves to bat at the four different toys hanging from the giraffe's legs.  Each toy provides a different sensory experience - it is educational and keeps him interested.  My son has now started to grab the rings and the other toys and he trys to put them in his mouth.  He also loves to look at the giraffe's face and the spots on his body.  He never bores of this giraffe - it makes him so happy!  Really this is just a great toy I recommend it over others of a similar character.
Baby,5.0,Excellent!,"We bought this mobile 4 years ago for my newborn daughter. We used it for almost 2 years every day and night. Then I packed it in the attic, even forgetting to take the batteries out. Now, 2 years later, I am expecting a son so I wiped it with a wet wipe, installed it on the crib again and, with the new batteries, it works just like new. The music is soothing, not too loud on the higher volume setting. I was amazed! I totally recommend it!"
Baby,5.0,I LOVE this mobile!!,"I really LOVE this mobile.  I've had it for about a year now (my daughter is now 15 months old) and it works great.  I bought it in part because there were reviews that it was too quiet (and also because I had other rainforest products my baby liked).  As far as I'm concerned, if it's on the crib and it's playing music for my baby to go to sleep to, I want quiet and soothing.  I leave it on the lower of the two sound levels and I can hear it just fine (even with a humidifier and fan running for white noise in the same room) so I'm pretty sure the baby in the crib can hear it.  The movement of the rainforest animals is very quiet too which is nice. I like the classical music selections as well as the rain forest sounds.  And the light is a low/warm light that isn't disturbing at all to a sleeping (or almost sleeping) baby.  My daughter goes to sleep to it every night and if she wakes up in the night she just hits the button to start it up again and goes back to sleep.  We even travel with it and attach it to the crib at Grandma's house to help my daughter sleep away from home.    The only negative thing I have to say about it is the remote control is pretty much useless.  It appears to only work if you've recently turned the mobile on manually (but you have to use it within about 15 min of turning the mobile on).  I'm not sure what the point of that is.    But overall this has been one of my best purchases and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quiet/soothing mobile."
Baby,5.0,Great attention getter,"Sir Prance A Lot really holds the attention of my 2-1/2month grandson. The colors do it first and then there are the krinkle noises and the squeak. It is a hit, like other Lamaze toys i've given him."
Baby,4.0,Great Back-Up/Alternative Playmat,"We have loved this as a back-up playmat that we keep in another room, while we use a larger playmat in our main living area for daily use.    The best feature to this playmat is the tummy-time display at the end with a mirror, rolly-ball, and silky leaf-flap. This continues to be a favorite place for tummy-time.  The little pillow that comes with is pretty useless, but a good idea. We also switch up the structure of this so that the arch is over the actual mat.   This is also a great set-up for play in a bebepod/bumbo chair, as the hanging toys are within reach of a baby in such a seat.   I wish that there were more options for hanging toys...here, they attach with velcro to a small hanging strap rather than a typical loop that you can attach a link to. The giraffe is pretty cute : )  The colors, while bright, are not as obnoxious as the square Rainforest playmat. Another bonus is that this disassembles and folds up pretty compactly.  Overall, if I could only have one playmat, I would stick with the larger Precious Planet playmat, but as another play area option, this one is great!"
Baby,3.0,not loud enough,"My 2 month old son loves watching this, but the volume (even when on high) is so low that if any thing else is on in the house, you can't hear it."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,The wee-ride has finally allowed us to go out & about as a family. Our 14 month old just loves it! Super easy to install on a bike & the seat mount couldn't be easier to operate! It feels so good to get outside again!
Baby,5.0,Simple and does the job,"Easy to put on the stroller.  Securely holds my Nalgene water bottle, iphone, keys, snack, burp cloth.  I am happy with this purchase, and the price is great."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,I love this!  It makes my umbrella stroller so much more convenient to use.  I use it to hold my water bottles and drinks for my baby.
Baby,5.0,Lifesaver!,"My parents had gotten this as a gift for my daughter when she was born (she's 10 1/2 months now) and I've seriously used it every single night. When she was first born, and not sleeping through the night at all, we just kept turning it on over and over to get her used to the music to calm her back to sleep. Originally we tried the rainforest sounds option, but it didn't do much for her. The music however is nice and calming and didn't bother us even though she slept in the same room. It goes through all three songs and lasts about 20 minutes, usually the amount of time it takes her to fall asleep. The remote makes it handy to switch it back on while we're still in bed or to pop in to turn it on from the living room. Since she's older we don't use the movement part of the mobile anymore, just the music but she still enjoys looking at them and hasn't fussed with them much when she stands so it's still there. When she was smaller the music and the mobile spinning helped her fall to sleep and it gave us the opportunity to tell her what the different animals were and the colors. I highly recommend this to anyone who's going to have a baby soon or as a great baby shower gift."
Baby,5.0,great thing to have!,This is a great thing to have for wipes and drinks so you do not have to dig them out of the bag. In hindsight I would have bought a stroller with an attachment already but this worked perfectly for us.
Baby,4.0,i like them,"georgous ratles but a little small for the fatty wrists of my baby girl, however they are very flashing, she loves them"
Baby,2.0,Not worth it. There are better gyms,"The toys are velcro on. The Toys are also very high up and hard to reach. My child is 6 months and I bought this as another thing for her to do. She could barley reach it and she is tall for her age. The hanging Zebra is hard to work. The only thing she liked was teh butterflys, which she yanked off withing hte first 5 minutes and started chewing on. Fisher price can do better."
Baby,1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!  I've never written a review for any product.... This one is bad enough to warrant a warning.  Product is great concept with poor execution at best.  Does not link, disconnect app sucks.  If you buy it you will end up returning it."
Baby,5.0,Loves it!,"My son, now almost 7 months, loves this toy!  He started noticing it LONG before he noticed his other toys and it was the ONLY toy he played with in the beginning.  It is nice that the velcro is larger so that I can hook it to something and have the ability to let it hang a little lower or higher, depending on what he is in need of.  He is now to the point that I don't hang it on anything usually because he he perfers it on the floor or in his lap where he can manipulate it how he wants and chew on it if he would like.  I love all the different tectures and the main reason I got it, the black and white on it.  Which I have been told and read about that it is the best thing for babies under 6 months.  I would definetly recommend this toy for a friend!"
Baby,5.0,cute,I got this as a gift for someone it was very cute and I am sure that they loved it. would buy again
Baby,5.0,Great stroller organizer,"I purchased this for our peg perego uno stroller since all pegs seem to come with is a flimsy little cup holder - I was glad to find this attachable caddy. It holds two drinks and whatever random smaller things you  may need to throw in the middle like a wallet, keys, tissues, etc.<br /><br />It attaches by velcro loops on either side which are easy to fasten and they are pretty long so they would accommodate different sizes of strollers pretty easily. The fabric seems very sturdy and strong. It looks like it would be washable but not sure on that."
Baby,5.0,GOOD!,"They serve their purpose. I pump directly to my PES wide neck, and I am able to store them in the ref if I will feed them to my baby that day. I can also use this to pump/store when I am out at work."
Baby,5.0,entertaining,Oh sooo perfect for long car rides and just very stimulating for the babies! Helps them explore their world. High contrasting colors are better for them to see.
Baby,5.0,Grandkids loved these!,My older grandchilds mom had these for her baby and my son just loves them for his son?  Good for helping kids find their world!
Baby,3.0,Didnt work for me,"I was told by lots of people this worked for the baby jogger city select... it doesnt. The canopy from the seat makes it so it tilts / like this when attached. not very good when you have a drink in it. I actually got my money back, but I could see it being good for another stroller."
Baby,5.0,My daughter loves this mobile!,"My 4.5 month old just got this mobile and loves it!  We were looking for one that moved and played music for longer than just a couple of minutes to replace one we had from Pottery Barn.  She seems captivated by the flapping leaves and soothed by the music (which I was afraid was too soft but actually is perfect at lulling her to sleep)... Love the bright colors and shapes as well as the multiple choices for music.  All that, and not a bad price at all."
Baby,1.0,Used them for one day.,The high contrast design fascinates her. Beyond that I do not recommend this product. It didn't fit her at three months old. They where not shaped for the feet so they fit awkwardly. They did not rattle loudly either.
Baby,1.0,Can't get it to seal,"I've used Avent bottles since my daughter was born, and a Hygeia pump, and I've never had any problems with any of them.  I got these sealing disks intending to send bottles to daycare - I'm not sure what's wrong but I can't get a seal.  Everything leaks, whether it's the 4 oz. bottle or the 9 oz.  We tried snapping the disk into the ring as tightly as possible, and also laying it in more loosely before screwing down the ring, and in both cases, milk leaks out of the bottom of the cap, where the ring meets the bottle.  I'm really disappointed, since it would have been a great solution for us."
Baby,5.0,great item,"great item for our grandchild  he played all christmas with it and had a blast, it seemed fine for him at only even 6 months"
Baby,5.0,Great for making Avent bottles mutli-purpose,I purchased these a few months ago and use them daily.  Our daughter is exclusively on breast milk so I use these in the 9 ounce avent bottles to store breastmilk in the fridge and when we travel.  Instead of having multiple bottles made I can put 2-3 feedings worth of milk in one larger bottle and then use it as necessary.  I also plan on using these with the 4 ounce avent bottles to store baby food in.  I couldn't find them at Target which was a bummer but was happy to find them on Amazon!
Baby,4.0,Comparison versus FP precious planet mobile,"My wife and I are expecting twins so we bought both the rainforest and the precious planet mobiles. Both mobiles are well designed and are absolutely adorable.  Pros for the Rainforest  The head piece that dangles over the baby is a lot more intricate compared to the precious planet model. The leaves droop up and down as the stuffed animal rotate around it. There is a lot more visual stimulation when there is good lighting in the room.  The sound options are all pleasant from classical musical choices and a rainforest sound.  Cons for the Rainforest  While the head price is more intricate than the precious planet, more moving parts means greater chance of something breaking down in the future. A lot of neg feedbacks from amazon and Fischer price suggests that this mobile can break down for those few unlucky owners.  The attachment to the crib is not as flexible compared to the precious planet. The mount consists on a large plastic screw that you place between the railing and the back mounting nut. The mobile has a hinge that must rest on a horizontal surface. If you have a crib with curves or a thick top railing, you will be limited on where you can place this mobile. Also as you are screwing the back bolt onto the mobile, I'm worried about scratching the crib. A towel or something soft can prevent this, but becomes a hazard if your little one tries to grab or pull on it. The precious planet uses a snap on strap so you can mount it anywhere on your crib.  Pros for precious planet  While head piece does not have the wow factor of the rainforest, the mobile projects aminal pictures to the head piece, which reflects back down to the baby. During the day time, I prefer the rainforest. At low lighting conditions the precious planet wins.  The mobile can attach anywhere on the crib, while the rainforest needs a flat railing surface.  Might have better longevity because once the baby gets older and the head price is removed, the animal projector will reflect off the ceiling.  Cons  Not as cute compared to the rainforest from stuffed animals to head piece design.  Overall they are both great mobiles.  Precious planet is better for low lighting conditions and cribs with curvy or thick railings.  Rainforest has better stimulation for babies in well lit conditions."
Baby,4.0,Good quality.,"We purchased this when our son was 3 months old for Christmas.  He used it some when he was little, and our older son (3 years) enjoyed pushing him in circles.  They are now 2 and 4 and my 4 year old will spin our 2 year old around on it and it hasn't broke - and is still in \\""brand new\\"" shape.  The only complaint is that it sits ontp of the bottom piece so it isn't really secure when they are younger and te pieces usually ended up in our sons mouth when he was young."
Baby,5.0,Baby's Favorite,"My 6 month old loves this toy. The textures, sounds and colors keep her interest. She is currently teething and loves the textured rings on the horse's tail. The horse is about the size of her chest, but she can still shake it and move it easily, which is something we have found to be important for her at this stage. It also has lots of parts that are easy for her to grasp, making it rewarding for her to reach for. I also think that this is an easy toy to make up short stories for her, making it an interactive toy that can encourage language development. Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,"Love, Love, Love","I bought this for my new grandson.  The normal pacifiers would fall out of his mouth and if they hit the floor they would bounce and sometimes be very hard to locate.  We lost one under the bed for a month!  This has been wonderful.  If he spits it out it stays right close by.  Plus, he has a little something to hold onto for security.  I actually plan on ordering a second one to have around because we and he loved it so much!"
Baby,4.0,best pacifier ever!,It's worth the money. My son wouldn't take any of the other pacifiers especially the ones made of silicon. It's adorable and he started grabbing for the toy by 3 months old! love it.
Baby,2.0,Good in theory only,"Although very cute, does not really help in keeping the pacifier in place. If the animal (ours is the monkey) were weighted a little more (I presume this is a safety feature) it would possibly work better. If the baby is lying flat on his back it does assist a little, if reclined at all in swing or car seat- which is where you really need it, we have not found it to be any better in keeping the pacifier from falling out as frequently."
Baby,5.0,super cute,"My baby loves these & will stare at them intensely as if she's waiting for them to talk back! She is still too small to wear them & notice them at 6 weeks but what I do is attach them to her [[ASIN:B000S9RF4M Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll]]above her rock n play and she is sooooo happy! It's been amazing this last week because we really started to notice her smiling at her toys and she loves her little bee & lady bug! I can't wait to see her wear them to play soon!"
Baby,5.0,An infant favorite,"My 6 month granddaughter loves this toy! She responds to the bright colors, textures and sounds. The teething rings are helping sooth her gums as well."
Baby,3.0,"Cute, but...","I purchased these socks for my 5mos old because she had a similar pair with flowers on them that fit her feet so snug that she couldn't wiggle them off. I can't keep socks or shoes on my little one - a feet fidgeter - so I thought and hoped these would fit like the others she has... However, they do not. While they do grab her attention, which is great, they are completely straight (no curve or allowance in material for the shape of the foot/heel area) and DO NOT stay on her feet. In fact, they slip off rather easily. Also, at 5mos old, they barely fit up her ankles/calves, which is part of the reason why they don't stay on well, and my baby (according to the charts) runs on the small side of average. So... all in all, these are cute, but... they just didn't work for us."
Baby,4.0,A baby shower hit,"These are adorable and were a total hit at a recent office baby shower.  I wanted something cute and somewhat unique, the latter to minimize the risk that someone else would get a similar, duplicative gift.  Mission accomplished.  No similar gifts and none of the moms had even heard of them.    I haven't heard yet whether they encourage reaching or are otherwise interesting to the baby.  Either way, they sure are cute!  I'd definitely get another pair."
Baby,4.0,Works for what I want it for.,"This product generally reviews poorly on various sites - so much so that had I researched it prior to picking it up on impulse at the local Apple store (figuring I could return it if necessary), I probably wouldn't have bothered. That said, I'm not sure if there have been upgrades since some of the early terrible reviews, but it seems to work fine for me. Setup wasn't difficult at all - following the instructions in the iBaby app resulted in an easy setup in about five minutes. I will say that I suspect some of the dissatisfied customers didn't understand that it has to be set up the first time with a wired connection to your router (cable is included, which is slightly surprising, but nice), but then can simply be unplugged and moved wherever you want it. I've had no significant trouble (except see below) accessing the camera on my local WiFi, over the Internet from different WiFi networks, or via AT&T's 3G network, with the expected latency depending on access method. I'll say that I'm not particularly fluent with wireless networking or webcams, so I would have returned the thing long before messing around with port forwarding or any of the other 'advanced user settings' that people have described having to use for various iOs based video monitors.   Beyond the quick setup guide included with the iBaby app, though, the documentation was comically bad. The device came packaged with a CD containing a PDF users guide, which appears to have been translated from Chinese either by a human who's never spoken to a native English speaker or by a computerized translation program. This quality of manual would be embarrassing for a $20 clock/radio bought at CVS. For an almost $200 device aimed at new parents and sold in the Apple Store, it's absolutely appalling. Honestly, how hard can it really be, even for a company based in China, to find a high school or college student who is a fluent speaker of both English and Mandarin to translate the frickin manual? It would probablycost about $1000!   The quality of the image itself was more than adequate - even surprisingly good with the night vision. Audio was acceptable - not as good as the Angelcare audio monitor we have, but acceptable. The iBaby app is somewhat basic, but intuitive and works fine (although I haven't tried to add a second camera yet); allows easy panning and tilting with a finger swipe as well as capturing a snapshot to your iPhone or iPad. I'm less impressed by the audio and movement alerts - not so much because they don't work as because it plays poorly in the sandbox with the iOs device's desire to be locked and asleep - I suspect it would work fine if you plugged it in and left the screen on without using the device for anything else, but who really wants to do that? The app claims you can leave it on and it will continue to function with the screen asleep; the time I tried that it resulted in waking up in the morning to a screen full of multiple text alerts (the audible alert seems not to have sounded, and given how loud it is I'm pretty sure I would've woken up) followed ultimately by a warning that the connection to the camera had been lost.   Which leads me to my bottom line about the device, and probably the source of a lot of dissatisfaction. The iBaby, and probably iOs-based baby video monitors in general, are not quite ready for prime time if you want to depend on it as your *only* method of monitoring the baby, particularly if you have medical concerns or anything. We use it in conjunction with our Angelcare audio monitor, which has always worked perfectly without problems; basically, we use the iBaby video to *check on* the baby, not so much to *monitor* the baby. (I.e., once we've heard her cry or whatever, to answer the question of \\""What in the world is she *doing* in there?\\"" without having to go in the room.) This is not the iBaby's fault so much as it is the fault of WiFi in general - I don't know how it is for other people, but our WiFi is a little unstable - it's not terribly uncommon for it to drop signal or kick a laptop or our BluRay player off the network. For most devices, this simply results in a freeze for a few seconds while the device signs back on to WiFi; for the iBaby, you pretty much have to do it manually by closing the app and opening it again. This is slightly frustrating but no big deal if you're using it like we are, but you can see how people would hate it if the iBaby were their only monitor.   I can compare the device to the Summer Infant BabyTouch, which reviews very well; we inadvertantly purchased both at the same time. The iBaby has slightly better video quality and slightly worse audio quality than the Summer Infant, although both were adequate. (It's not HD, but for a little webcam with night vision, what do you want?) The Summer Infant has a (digital) zoom that's not very useful, whereas the iBaby does not. Controlling the camera is much better with the iBaby. The Summer Infant has a built in speaker that you can use to talk back through it; somewhat deceptively, the iBaby doesn't (what it has is a *connection* for an external speaker that you have to buy separately), but we don't really feel like that's all that important. The iBaby has the above problems with unstable WiFi connections, whereas the Summer Infant worked perfectly out of the box, never losing connection even for a moment. They're similarly priced; some reviwers have described the iBaby as grossly overpriced, which it probably is if you have the networking skills to buy a Foscam for about $100, an iOs based app for $5-10 to drive it, and set it up on your wireless network. I don't, and I have better uses for the several hours (and probably having to purchase a book on wireless networking) that it would take me to figure it out; I'd rather just pay the extra money.   So why did we keep the iBaby and send the Summer Infant back? Because the Summer Infant reliably - although not instantaneously, which is interesting - fried our WiFi network and made all sorts of devices, from networked printers to our BluRay player, to my wife's laptop, completely useless because of poor connection. Now, it's been suggested that this problem can be solved by changing the channel on your router (we use a Cisco Linksys E3000), but again, I really don't want to be spending my time playing sysadmin for my wireless network when it's clearly the fault of a specific device with a noisy signal. We'll keep our reliable Angelcare sudio monitor for workhorse use and our iBaby for visual checking in, thanks."
Baby,3.0,Buyer Beware- not for every crib,"I loved this mobile, but had to return it because it does not fit safely on my crib.  The locking mechanism does not seem very sturdy and is about 3-4 inches wide, so it will not work on a crib rail that is wider.  It also would not work on a curved crib railing. I wish it had a better attachment so that I could keep it, but it does present a safety hazard on some cribs."
Baby,5.0,EXACTLY the same as Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"I was looking for a \\""parent cup holder\\"" for my Britax B-Agile stroller.. the Britax one was $15 and from reading the reviews, I noticed alot of people weren't happy with it. So I went in search of a better one and saw that the \\""Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy\\"" was really highly rated.  However, it was $12.95 PLUS $10 shipping! After some more searching, I found the \\""Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Organizer\\"" for $10 so I ordered it.  It's EXACTLY the same thing and it's been working great. It doesn't get in the way when folding the stroller which was a big plus and the cup holder's adjust to different cup sizes.  Even has a zippered pocket to keep my car keys close but safe.  Highly, highly recommend!!"
Baby,5.0,best thing ever!,My baby loves his paci and the animal attached makes it so easy for him to find it!  We will definitely buy another one for our next child(ren).
Baby,5.0,New Baby Grandson,Got this for my new baby grandson Keaton. He will be born on 1-16-12 and I gave it to his parents for Christmas. They were so excited and I know he will love his little monkey paci.
Baby,5.0,CUTE AND FUNCTIONAL,"I haven't seen these in person yet, but my son and daughter-in-law both like them.  She even confirmed that the actual pacifer is the same kind given to their twins in the hospital.  They appear to make the pacifer both easier to stay put and easier to find."
Baby,5.0,Used for 2 years and still love it!!! Also great for cloth wipes!,"I love that this holds more wipes than some travel wipes case, it doesn't have to be refilled as often. I've never had a problem with wipes drying out as long as I remember to close it securely before putting it in the diaper bag. I also love the slide opening. I bought this over 2 years ago and it still looks and works like new. It matches perfectly with our Skip Hop Duo Double diaper bag (also amazing!). About 6 months ago, I switched to cloth wipes and this works well for that. I put dry cloth wipes in the case (fits 6-8 depending on how I place them in). I keep a peri bottle in the diaper bag with wipes solution and moisten the wipes when I'm ready to use them. Keeps the wipes and case mold free, great for the environment!"
Baby,4.0,Definite Upgrade,"This case is a definite upgrade from the cheap plastic case I've been using that came in a travel changing kit. I can fit a ton of wipes in it (which is great since I have two kids in diapers), they stay moist, and the slide mechanism is very handy."
Baby,5.0,practical,"Super practical and easy to use, you can put anywhere, and bring me in the diaper bag! I love ."
Baby,5.0,VERY SOOTHING!,This is the best mobile I have owned yet.  It is very soothing and I like how you can turn the mobile on or just the music.  My son enjoys it.  It is very well made and colourful!
Baby,5.0,Good idea!,"I brought it when my son was 6 months old, he enjoyed it and even now he is 14 months old, he still enjoys it. You have to take away to the turning part while he is able to get up on his own. Now before going to bed, he even turns on the music on his own and choose the piece of the music that he like. The music indeed offers some comfort and peace for him. It is such a good idea."
Baby,5.0,Wrist rattles,We ordered these writs rattles for Christmas and I love them. Their colors are prefect for young babies and the wings on the bee make a crinkling sound then they are touched. They can also be thrown in the with the laundry which is a huge plus. Our son loves to nibble on them.
Baby,5.0,Love Wubanub,Tried this one out first before buying multiples for our son.  He loves it. So we bought the giraffe and the puppy too!
Baby,4.0,Great gym,"This is a very nice gym with lots of fun, engaging activities for baby. It plays music and has lots of textures and colors. We never found it too small, it was just right and didn't take up the whole living room. It was also easy to wash in the washing machine. Once my baby was older (7 months or so) she would pull the butterflies out of the tree because they're only attached with Velcro."
Baby,5.0,Never seen a newborn so enchanted!,"I purchased this for my new grand daughter.  From the day my daughter brought her home from the hospital the baby spends 30 minutes to an hour just watching the critters go round.  She likes the Bach and Beethoven better than the Mozart.  She also is attentive to the jungle sounds.  Lights move, leave go up and down, remote to turn it on and off are really wonderful features.  The bright colors especially attract a baby's attention."
Baby,5.0,Baby likes it.,"Bought it for a friend's baby, and father told me his baby stopped crying when the music was on. Although the baby might get used to it someday later, but it certainly worked for the first time."
Baby,5.0,"Great product, great price.",This is a great organizer for stroller. I have a Baby Jogger City Mini and it fit perfectly. I turned mine so the Diono words are facing the stroller.  It is a very roomy organizer and can hold a lot. I looked at other stroller organizers but chose this one based on the reviews and the great price. It also has a zippered pocket inside for ID and money
Baby,2.0,For small infants only...,"Super cute and the baby was definitely intrigued by them, BUT they have such little stretch that they barely fit a 4 month old! Very tight."
Baby,5.0,spica mom,great product! the velco really holds & doesnt fall off even while folding the stroller! im really happy with it
Baby,3.0,Didn't work for us,"I've heard a few people swear by these things, so obviously they work well for lots of kids.  My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)"
Baby,1.0,Broke after 8 months.,"I loved this for my baby jogger city mini, but after 8 months of use, the straps literally came right off.  Also, strings kept unraveling off of the velcro straps used to fasten it to the handle.  It was a great buy, but had I known that it was not well made, I would have sprung for a more expensive model.  Not sure which one I will be going for next round."
Baby,3.0,Short-lived,"I realize now these are kind of pointless. I got excited when my daughter started noticing her feet whenever there was some kind of embellishment on the bottom of the pants she was wearing, so I figured these would really get her attention. They did. But we only used them a few times. It didn't take too long for her to figure out where her feet were and to play with them constantly without help of \\""foot finders\\"". If anything, bare feet are way more interesting to her because they have toes! So I would suggest to everyone to just settle down and not waste your money on something you'll use just a few times.  As far as staying on - my daughter is HUGE (95th percentile) with the chubbiest legs and calves and although these were tight, they fit just fine. I think they would be better if they had some stretch to them, but we didn't have any problems. They'd start to slide off after awhile but it was no big deal. And this is a girl who can't wear boots because her calves are way too fat. Just don't tell her that 15 years from now :)"
Baby,1.0,"Great idea, terrible product","If you plan on using this with a Mac or iOS device, do not buy this product.  The software (which comes on a CD, should have known right there that the support would be terrible) is ridiculously unusable and support has been extremely poor from the manufacturer.  The iOS App was pulled at some point from the App store so you can no longer download the App at all, destroying all hopes of ever using this on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.  If you want something like this, save yourself some money and go purchase and IP Camera.  This was a total waste of money and the developers should take a few lessons in software development because it looks like they ripped off some open-source videoLAN project and just smacked their iBaby logo on top.  Don't expect any support for this product at all if you are fooled into buying it."
Baby,1.0,no good,updated review...17 months later. i purchased this because i liked that its a reusable and i love skip hop items i have their diaper bag!!<br /><br />i thought hey i can refill as needed and attach to the stroller etc. however the strap on it broke and it would no longer hang or attach to the stroller and the slider was not the best. It would not hold any moisture for the wipes. i have plenty of those cheap wipe holders you get and they hold moisture better than this thing. Not to happy about this item after all.
Baby,5.0,Dee Dee is so cute!,"I was so in love with [[ASIN:B004BSFC6E Lamaze Play and Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toy]] that I immediately had to buy my baby girl more friends to play with! Dee Dee is so freaking cute with her dorky teeth and colorful body! She is not quite as educational as Rusty but I think Dee Dee will be just as fun for her to grow with and be BFF's with in the end!<br /><br />BTW we now have added [[ASIN:B002VWZU7S Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari] and [[ASIN:B000I2MRLK Lamaze Play and Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy]] to the crew!!!"
Baby,3.0,Just OK,"I bought this for my five year old for christmas. The quality of the toy met my expectations. I like the wood products over the plastic. My main complaint is that this is pretty dificult to use. There isn't a lip or anything to rest the arrow on, so I had to spend an hour or more teaching my son to shoot it with his finger holding the arrow in place. So he lost interest pretty quick because its already difficult to shoot before even attempting to learn how to aim this thing."
Baby,5.0,good,good toy. well made. my daughter likes it (she is 4months old). it is on her carseat when we drive somewhere and she likes to watch on it.
Baby,5.0,Amazing invention,"Great product for keeping a paci in an infant's mouth!  I wish I had known about it sooner.  Monkey is cute, too.  I can see my son learning to love it."
Baby,1.0,dead on arrival,"Looks so cute and it promises so much, so for the price it sounds like an amazing deal. I wish it worked. Ours was dead out of the box. Took the time to put it together, put the batteries in and...nothing! Took it apart, put it back together checking each step 10 times to make sure we didn't make an error...finally tried it again with another set of batteries. It never worked: never turned on, never made a sound. Very bad quality."
Baby,4.0,My son loves it but its soo quiet,"The mobile holds my 2 month old son's attention.  The basic colors make it easy for him to see, as he prefers to look the lights for the contrast.  The mobile has 2 volumes, both of which  fairly quiet (especially the rainforest sounds).  The length of time it plays is sufficient, not too long or too short. I would recommend this mobile for young babies, since it seems to have helped develop my son's focus and eye contact."
Baby,5.0,Love this thing,"I bought it to use with Uppa baby vista and it work great, Then I got an uppa baby gluxe and it works with it too. You can collapse the stroller with the caddy attached. You can put two cups/bottle and there is a mesh pocket with a zipper for change/cards/etc - very convenient and several friends got it after they saw me use it."
Baby,5.0,Helps my baby sleep!,This is the only mobile I have tried so I have nothing to compare it to but I definitely won't be shopping for anything else.  I was looking for something to keep my 6 week old son entertained while getting use to his crib because every time I put him in there he would cry.  The mobile did much more for my son than I expected.  He will lay in the crib and watch the mobile at night until he falls asleep.  I think it is the movement of the leaves that keeps his attention because the motion is large enough for him to focus on at this young age.  Overall this is a great product and I am thrilled that it helps him (and me) sleep!!
Baby,1.0,Just awful,"I ended up investing dozens of hours attempting to set the camera up. Never worked.  We returned it.. Where to begin with why...  1) When I was actually able to get a wired (plugged into my Internet router) connection, there was a delay. Right off the bat, THAT situation does not allow this to be a \\""baby monitor\\"" at all!  2) Despite hours & hours reading documentation & speaking with customer service, we were never able to unplug this from the router, and so we could not move it to baby's room.  3) iPad connection never worked. App crashed.  4) we installed pc software & it was really \\""tech-y\\"" and not user friendly  This is more like an \\""IP camera\\"" and would be better as a vacation house monitor.... If you have a masters degree in computer networking (company told me to study up on something called \\""port forwarding\\"" if I wanted to use this outside of range of our wifi router."
Baby,5.0,no leaks,"these work good.  go with the bottle.  stops leaks.  you can pump out a bottle, pop one of these little babies under the screw on rim, grab a spare nipple and you are ready to go!"
Baby,5.0,Monkey Wubbanub,This is just an absolutely brilliant invention. I wasn't too keen on having a dummy for my son at first but we have come to love it now and never leave home without one.  It is great as he is able to hold it himself now and reduces the amount of time we have to spend playing shove the dummy back in.  Plus he loves the plush monkey so it really is  a two in one for him.  We have one for the bed and one for out in the playroom. We really need another to just keep in the car.
Baby,5.0,My baby's favorite toy,"I bought this for my baby when I was three months pregnant, and though she did not enjoy it so much in utero, she simply LOVES it now (and has for months).  I think she started becoming really interested in it when she was about three months old, and now she's almost six months, and she keeps finding different things about it to love.  At first she loved the attached rings, and then she moved on to the crinkly feet and now she's obsessed with all of the tags (but especially the manufacturer's tags).  This toy also helped a lot with tummy time, early on, where I could make him \\""prance\\"" by her field of vision and she could hear the jingle."
Baby,5.0,Great design!,"Our Brian loves this pacifier! He holds on to it for dear life, and just loves the little monkey. This is one clever design, and it's the second one we've purchased in this series. I guarantee we'll be back for more, because the baby just loves it so much."
Baby,5.0,Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought 2 mobiles and 1 Einstein soother before finally purchasing this.  This is the only mobile that would fit our crib, and how lucky are we that our daughter absolutely loves it!  We have a sleigh crib and this fits.  Finally!  I was exhausted looking for something that would fit the crib.  She loves to watch the leaves move and the music is nice.  The nature sounds could be louder, but overall I am happy and so is Adyson!"
Baby,5.0,WubbaNub,Mothers and babies love them there are many animals to choose from. Enough to match any baby's decor no matter what
Baby,5.0,Perfect,Lots of storage--great with my contours lite stroller. It has a zippered compartment for keys and phone. Easy to attach.
Baby,5.0,The cutest thing,"I recieved the item fast and as decribed,my daughter loves it,since she was born shes been all about monkeys and this was perfect for her.  Thanks so much for a great service and a perfect toy."
Baby,4.0,a wise purchase,My baby definitely likes it! He would watch it and laugh by himself for 20 minutes or even one hour.  While he pays no attention to other music box
Baby,5.0,Works great on city mini double,"Bought this to use on our city mini side by side double and works great holding my coffee, water bottles, kids cups and cell phone/ keys"
Baby,5.0,So cute!,"I just got this mobile about a week ago and love it already.  I originally ordered it to give to my parents to have for their crib at their house for when my son stays with them (my mom watches him during the day when I'm at work).  We already had a mobile for our own house but I wanted to see what this one was like so I put it up in our crib (it is very easy to assemble - it takes 3 D batteries and 2 AA).  It's so cute I decided to keep it. lol We had a mobile from pottery barn kids that cost twice as much and it's not nearly as effective.  Yes, it's just about the cutest mobile I've ever seen but it's a wind up and the music is extremely loud and fast (mary had a little lamb).  My son loved to look at it but it never soothed him to sleep.  This one is amazing.  The music lasts for about 18 minutes and it has 2 volume levels.  It also has a nightlight that you can turn on or off.  And the whole thing comes with a remote control which is nice so the baby doesn't see you turning the mobile back on.  I'll probably be ordering another one for my parent's house as well.  Definitely recommend."
Baby,5.0,ADORABLE,These went over very big at the baby shower. I can hardly wait for the baby to come to see them in action!!
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my B-Agile,"I was weary at first to purchase this particular one, as it was half the price of others and was afraid it would be cheaply made. I was very pleased to find that my water bottle (20oz) fits great and the caddy doesn't become lopsided with only that in it. Exactly what I needed to make my stroller a perfect 5 stars (Britax B-Agile)"
Baby,5.0,Very nice organizer,"Purchased this organizer to go with my Joovy stroller.  Very disappointed in stroller, the sippy cups my kids use didn't fit in their cup holders.  This organizer is great?  It holds larger sippy cups and has a deep enough pouch to hold snacks and stuff to keep kids happy in the mall.  Definately would recommend this organizer."
Baby,1.0,TERRIBLE - DOES NOTHING!,This thing SUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! It weighs NOTHING!  It's BARELY WIDER than a playing card!  It's tinyness and weightlessness means the binky gets shot right out of the kids mouth.  Needs to be WAY BIGGER.  Also - angle of the binky is horizontal - NOT VERTICAL.  TERRIBLE to retain in mouth.  DO NOT BUY
Baby,5.0,Perfect for babies with really extra small feet.,"My baby was 9 pounds at birth and 12 pounds at time of purchase but her lil feet hardly hold newborn size anything on them, she's 2+ months now.  These play socks stay on perfectly with just the right amount of tightness so she can work at actually being rewarded with pulling them off eventually once she masters that skill...however in the mean time they stay on her extra small feet perfectly all through our play session and boy does she love these...they really get her excited...especially the crinkly butterfly one...so don't buy these if baby has larger feet than newborn size because these fit a baby smaller than that but they do have a small bit of leeway so I say newborn or smaller foot size these are perfect, otherwise go to babies r us you can find some with more of a stretchy material...these are not at all stretchy so they will either fit or they won't...I love them.  Ty Ty."
Baby,5.0,nice fit for the Baby Jogger City Mini,Fits well on the Baby Jogger.  Tilts a little forward but not enough for stuff to fall out.  folds flat with the strolled
Baby,5.0,Lots of fun for parents and baby,"I got these for my own baby, but first used them with a visiting 3-month-old. She loved them so much, I have been buying them as a present for all my friends who recently had babies. Now my baby is old enough to enjoy them too, and loving every minute of it.  I agree that the socks have very little stretch and no shape (just a tube), but once they got too small for my baby, I just cut the rattles off and sewn them onto socks that fit. This way we can keep using them for months to come, and get to mix up colors too."
Baby,5.0,my baby loves this toy.,"My baby loves this toy!  Don't know why, but he tries to grab at it non-stop when I hang it above him..."
Baby,5.0,Amazing,"I purchased this mobile when my son was 1 month old. This has been great in entertaining him for awhile. Now that he is 5 months old this mobile helps put him to sleep. I love the 4 different music choices and the bright colors, they really catch his attention. I also like that the leaves move up and down while the animals rotate. So, it has a little more than your average mobile. The remote is a nice feature. I just never really had to use it because I would go up to his crib to check on him and I would just press one of the buttons to change the music anyway. It seems that one round of music last long enough until he falls asleep though. Overall I really love this product and it seems to do the trick. Also, this is a great price for what you get."
Baby,5.0,Love this stroller organizer,"I am pretty picky person, and I never write reviews. So I had to write one for this stroller organizer. I love it! for $10 this is the best stroller organizer! I am using it with my Britax B-Agile stroller. I have always been annoyed with organizer that won't hold my water bottles (Large Camelbak bottles) This one does, and fits all kinds of drinks, as the holding for the cups is adjustable. the organizer is also very sturdy, yet folds up with the stroller. it has a zippered pouch to hold keys. I, as a previous reviewer, turned the diono stiching so it was not showing. I would definately highly recommend this product."
Baby,4.0,Nice Toy,I bought this for my 6 month old twins (Boy & Girl) They mainly chew on it. It keeps them entertained for a few minutes. It is more entertaining if an adults uses it to interact with the baby.<br /><br />The quality is great. It will last a long time.
Baby,5.0,love it,This case allows me to carry a great load of wipes at any given time. My toddler is a messy one (who's isn't?!) and the ability to have so many wipes on me in a convenient case is a LIFE SAVER. And they stay moist!
Baby,4.0,Great product and worth the price!,"This is a great mobile. Very pretty, colorful, cute, the music is nice and calming and not too loud since it is supposed to be calming and not exciting. There is a little night light and my little girl loves to stare at it (8 months old). We have an Ikea cot so the frame is quite thin but I can see why this might not fit bulky framed and asymmetrical bed frames. 2 sound options and options to have the mobile turn or not and just to have the music, etc. Well worth the price. I do  not use the remote, I just walk in the room or let it turn off on its own."
Baby,3.0,Get the peacock,"I wanted to like this toy, but it's a little disappointing, and my 6 mo old agrees.  It's big and squishy, but the only squeaker is in the knight, and it's really quiet and hard to squeak.  The head has a big hard spot that makes a jingle when you shake it, the body just krinkles like the feet.  There's not enough variety in this toy to be stimulating.  It needs a big squeaker like in Jacque the Peacock.  My baby LOVES that one, which has all that this toy has, and more: Contrast patterns on the back, with bright colors on the front, A good face with big eyes (The horse's eyes are one on each side), a good squeaker, and layers of reinforced krinkle for good chomping."
Baby,4.0,Best Gift I didn't Register For!,"I didn't even register for this--I registered for a mobile from Etsy that wasn't mechanized.  This was given to me by a friend who never used it with her son...free of charge!  Boy, am I glad.  My daughter doesn't use this to fall asleep in her crib--she is put to sleep in the quiet--but I use this to entertain her when I need to buy myself a few minutes.  She's been truly enjoying it since about 2 1/2 months and now she's developed to the point where she \\""talks\\"" to it at 4 months.  I can leave her and I hear her shrieking with joy at the mobile.<br /><br />I wish I could say this put her to sleep but I guess it's too much stimulation for her because she gets very, very excited by it, even with the soothing music!"
Baby,5.0,THE BEST INVENTION! . . . Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,This is the BEST invention!!! PERFECT size and weight for babies of all ages. It's not tiny and stays great in babies mouth. Nothing bad to say about this AWESOME invention.<br /><br />I have purchased a few to have around our big two story home and car. I also purchased the red dragon and another monkey that looks like he is wearing pj's which is the one we use for bed/nap times. Very easy to find if baby takes it out while playing or sleeping. I also just throw it in the wash on gently cycle and let air dry. It dries in less than an hour too.<br /><br />Do Not hesitate DEFINITELY BUY!!! You will not regret it...
Baby,5.0,Love our rainforest friends,We spent an hour comparing different mobiles before we settled on this one.  We  were not disappointed. It is one of our most used baby items.  At 2 weeks our daughter loved watching the motions.  At five months she still loves watching her rainforest friends.  I don't know how many times I have hit the rainforest sounds button in the middle of the night and she will happily watch until she falls asleep.  It is worth every penny.  I was initially excited about the 4 different classical but I really prefer the rainforest sounds. On really hard to fall asleep evenings we also turn on her Sleep Sheep to make a little extra white noise.  I've only had to change the batteries twice - so not too bad.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"This product is the exact same as [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]], the company changed names, and this just has the new name on it. It was well-reviewed before, and will still be.<br /><br />I bought this for use on the [[ASIN:B004RKOC3U Mutsy Mutsy Easyrider Umbrella Stroller, Black]], and it fits beautifully! It does not interfere with the folding, recline, or canopy! I love that the cup holder part easily holds a small plastic water bottle, a cup of coffee, or a giant sippy cup with ease. It stretches to fit the container. There is a small mesh pocket in the center section that is very nice, and the rest of the middle part is open.<br /><br />This product is sturdy, but can be left on when the stroller is folded. I love it! It's exactly what I needed!"
Baby,3.0,Not very useful...,"Does the job I guess, but it doesn't keep the wipes very moist. I ended up getting travel packs of wipes instead. That way they don't dry out, and you can keep a pack in the car, in the stroller, in the diaper bag, etc."
Baby,4.0,OK if nothing else will work,"This is better than nothing if you have the kind of stroller where the handlebars are very upright.  The inner walls of the drink parts stretch so it will hold a variety of beverage containers.  It has a small zippered part inside the big part to hold...  I'm not sure what.  Something small.  Overall I don't think it's great because it's very swingy, being attached at only two points, and I don't like how the main compartment is so open.  I have things that \\""live\\"" in my strollers - our zoo keys, the leash to my BOB, things like that.  I don't like to have to empty the stroller caddy of these things when I put the stroller in the car.  If your stroller handle bar has any sort of flatness to it, I'd suggest the Jolly Jumper stroller caddy instead - it is like the Bob but cheaper.  It attaches in 4 places and just feels more stable and structured, and the inner part zips closed.  If your stroller is very upright, though, this works fairly well.  In its favor, the main compartment is somewhat larger, and the drink parts will hold slightly bigger drinks.  I feel like maybe there should be another set of straps at the bottom, to add stability, as well as a cover for the center compartment - although this might take away from the stretchy sides of the drink holders."
Baby,5.0,simple,"this was a gift for my 2m old son for his first christmas :-) love the mat its just simple fun and cute my 2yr thinks its fun too,lol  i get great floor time with both my kids with this it does not take up any space its easy to carry around or store away unlike other bulky ones"
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,I purchased this for my Graco Trekko stroller and it easily attaches to the handles with the velcro straps.  There is room for 2 drinks and sunglasses/keys etc.  As an added bonus you can leave this on when you fold the stroller up.  This was a great purchase!
Baby,5.0,The baby likes it,"My baby likes it. The sound is very good, the music selection is very soothing. I haven't changed the batteries in 4 months now. The leaves are cute and sleep-caller. :) I recommend it."
Baby,2.0,Too tight and not elastic enough,"These are a great idea, but they don't even have the elasticity of regular socks and they are too small and too tight for my child's feet. She was 2 months old when we first put them on her, and they barely fit over her cute little chubby legs. Now she's 4 months old and grabbing for her feet, and these things don't fit anymore!  Waste of money - I should have just bought the wrist rattles and sewed them onto regular socks!"
Baby,5.0,"Very nice, exactly what I needed!","Nice thick plastic, clicks closed and stays closed, wipes stay moist and will hook to almost anything.<br /><br />Great for hanging off the toilet paper roll holder in the bathroom for potty training toddlers!<br />You can open it one handed... closing tight usually requires two.<br /><br />Downside: I can see my daughter learning how to open this and rip the wipes all out quite quickly... but it never claimed to be toddler proof!"
Baby,3.0,It's ok,"My 7 month old son is teething so he was biting the ends (one tooth coming in, other than that, he's all gums) and he hurt his mouth on the striped mirror. He's fine, no injuries. There are teething pieces on the end of this toy that are softer for his gums, but babies cannot differentiate. He likes this toy, but gets bored with it fast."
Baby,3.0,"I wanted to like it, but it needs work","I really wanted to like this.  iPhone/iPad integration, portable, it has some nice features.  I am comparing this against my Sharx SCNC2700W camera. Both are about $300.  Sharx info can be found here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005WFZD0U Sharx Security VIPcella-IR SCNC2700W Wifi Wireless b/g/n IP network camera with MicroSD DVR and True Day/Night vision]]<br /><br />I did not care for any of the push notifications, other parents may like this feature.  I don't care to hear any audio since I live in a small condo.  The talk back feature is nice, although with a slight delay (to be expected).<br /><br />What I like:<br />* Music feature is nice, but could use some more songs<br />* I like the iPhone/iPad app<br />* Pinch and zoom feature is okay, but I can do the same thing with Sharx camera, although they work a little differently.  The quality increases slightly on the Withings camera where the Sharx camera has no quality gain, but also doesn't need to refresh.<br />* Frame rate seems to stay fairly smooth when connected through ethernet. It's slightly better than Sharx when viewing on iPad.<br />* Portability - This is a nice bonus (1 hour of video on battery) but I don't cover this in my review because I would only use this 1% of the time.<br />* Wireless quality and frame rate don't degrade too much compared to Ethernet (with a good signal).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />* My main gripe is that I can't view the video on my computer.  I believe Withings has said this feature is coming in the future.<br />* Video quality - not on par with the Sharx camera I own in quality.<br />* Night Vision quality not as good as Sharx.  I would say the Sharx camera night vision is A LOT better actually. The Withings IR lights are too bright in the middle.<br />* No option to force IR mode on/off.<br />* No option to turn off audio on iPhone.  This could be fixed with a firmware update, but not sure if it will ever happen.<br />* Delay - I noticed maybe a 1.5 second delay when connected through ethernet.  A little under 2 seconds wireless.  Sharx delay is almost no delay when viewing on a computer, and less than a half second on iPad. These numbers are with a fairly strong wireless N connection.<br />* Sharx is a half second faster on WiFi than Withings is connected through Ethernet when viewing both on the iPad. I don't mind a small delay, and even 1 second to me isn't that bad.<br /><br />For a baby video monitor, I don't think you need HD quality (Sharx is only 640x480).  You mainly just need to see the baby and be able to tell if they are moving, awake, pacifier out, etc.  The Withings monitor is definitely good enough to be able to see all of this.  The Sharx camera is noticeably better which is a nice bonus. The Withings camera has a wider angle of view than Sharx.  Sharx certainly has a lot more options - continuous recording, snapshots, dydns setup, etc.  Sharx does involve more network knowledge to setup, where the Withings is easier to setup out of the box.<br /><br />If you are not experienced in network setup, DHCP reservation, dyndns configuration, don't mind slightly lower quality, and don't need to view it on a computer (yet), and don't mind a slight lag, the Withings monitor is decent.  If you are a more advanced user, want better quality, instantaneous feedback, and more advanced options, Sharx would be the way to go.  If Withings optical quality was a little better, and I could view it on a computer, it might be a different story, but I think I am going to keep the Sharx unit.  The portability, and iPhone/iPad integration is pretty cool and nerdy, but Sharx still looks better using Safari browser in iPad than Withings does with their app.  I really hope Withings does well with this, because I think they could make a lot better 2.0 product, and a little more work.  That said, it isn't a bad initial offering in my opinion.<br /><br />The biggest deal breaker is Withings charges to view away from home. I think 15 minutes each day are provided free.  My wife loves the setup of the Sharx so she can see her baby when she has time at work.  I would like it if Withings allowed a dns setup so I could use my own bandwidth for away-from-home use.<br /><br />6-1-2012 *I guess Withings has allowed unlimited viewing away from home which is nice, but it should have been offered in the first place.  I still stand by my 3 star review*<br /><br />There are many many other video cameras, IP cameras, & Baby monitors on the market.  These are just the two that I have used.  Actually, I have used the AngelCare monitor as well, but that has the worst quality of all, even though it has a nice portability factor."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I needed!,"Perfect accessory to hold my wallet, keys, baby's bottle, and a toy! It fit on my city mini perfectly and stores nicely attached to stroller when I fold it. I reccommend it and it is a good value."
Baby,4.0,Way better than our old monitor!,"We used to have the [[ASIN:B001EU4ZF6 MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System]].  We always seemed to have problems with it, even from the start.  Sometimes there was just no picture even though our room shares a wall with our baby's room.  I researched baby monitors for quite some time and was excited when I found the Withings smart baby monitor.  The only issue was that it was not available in the US yet.  After several months of waiting it finally became available so I snatched it up and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />Video quality is much better than our previous camera and I LOVE that I can access it away from home.  It is so wonderful to see my baby sleeping while I have to work late.  I haven't had a problem with the limited time period away from home but it would be nice to have the option for extended viewing for free.  The night vision is about on par with our previous monitor and gets the job done.  I am able to tell what he is doing in bed without issues.<br /><br />The screen shows temperature and humidity which is nice feature that I would have really enjoyed having when he was a newborn.<br /><br />I love being able to use my phone to talk to him, my husband and I have both utilized this feature away from the house and it works very well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have another way to mount it (perhaps on the wall) besides on the crib because the other day my son had managed to pull it off and into the crib.<br /><br />I really enjoy having this baby monitor and have already recommended it to several of my friends.  If you have an iPhone and the $$$, I would say go for it, you will not be disappointed."
Baby,5.0,better than more expensive options,"Hi,  This was exactly what I needed for both of my baby joggers.  It fit perfectly and held everything I needed.  I have the baby jogger city mini and the city elite.  It worked like a charm and held my keys, phone, life factory bottles, diapers, and wipes.  Hangs upright and has a wire frame on top to keep everything steady.  I love it.  AND THE PRICE CANNOT BE BEAT."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic!,"My son has been playing with this since he's about 3 months old, when he really got the hang of holding toys. I hang this over him in the playmat or the jumper and he can grab each leg easily and chews them all. He loves it."
Baby,5.0,Great gift for my little girl,"Used this great item for about 1 month already. Very good stuff for my baby girl. She is 3 months old now and likes this musical, mobile toy a lot! It could keep her quiet in her crib. And she bursts into laugh sometimes! So cute~"
Baby,5.0,Better than I thought it would be....,"This is perfect item for my baby... She loves staring at it, and what makes it very good is the moving leaf... Also the rain forest sound makes it perfect during night...  I recommend this item..."
Baby,3.0,Great for visual stimulation,"These socks are awesome for visual stimulation however they have no stretch to them so they don't fit my son's feet. Granted he does have larger feet for an infant, but theyt barely fit on him as a 4 wk old. So I use them on my fingers as puppets and he really likes them."
Baby,5.0,Fine by me,"Had no problems with installation.  Perhaps 20 mins.  Software is as advertised. No bells and whistles, just a monitor for iOS that works.  Going to get a 2nd one.<br /><br />Bought a 2nd one.  Again no problems whatsoever. I can toggle between the cameras with the software by two finger swiping.  EZ."
Baby,1.0,Doesn't work with FIOS,Worst customer support.  No phone number to call and over 24 hour response times to questions.  I have verizon FIOS as my internet provider and I got every DNS error under the sun.  Co couldn't figure out what to do and wouldn't call me on the phone to help so after 5 days and over 10 hours trying every which way to get this camera live on the network i have given up.  My advice for the company is if your going to try to be like apple and make apple type products at least try to offer some good support.
Baby,5.0,great for breastfeeding - pumping moms,"IT allows you to seal the bottle after pumping without any spills. It works great to take the bottles home after pumping at work. The next morning, I replace for a bottle nipple and it's ready to feed the baby without any mess."
Baby,5.0,Great addition to our stroller!,We bought this item to use on our lightweight stroller for our trip to Disney World (we have a Chicco Liteway).  It worked perfectly. It was so nice to have somewhere to put our drinks and other small items within reach vs trying to hold drinks and steer through the crowds. It easily held three medium drinks plus had room for snack bars or my phone. Love the addition of this to our stroller! Great product!
Baby,5.0,Withings monitor high quality design and tech,"Updated Review:<br /><br />Yay, Withings finally removed the costly remote usage fees.  Now people can enjoy from away from home easily and in a quality manner.<br /><br />there is a Review available at PeaceLoveApplePie.com but recommend people do their research."
Baby,5.0,Awesome product!,"I had the Angel Care motion/video/audio monitor on my registry, then changed my mind after learning that products such as those can't actually help prevent SIDS.  I'm a doctor, should have known that, but it's so easy to buy into the hype.  Instead I set out to find a monitor that allowed me to see my baby on my iPhone.  The Withings monitor does it!  And I love that I can use the battery power and easily move it around the house to where she is (e.g., in bassinet in the kitchen)."
Baby,5.0,Wowsa,"Withings really went all out. From the packaging to product design, the Apple influence is very apparent. I've been a frustrated user of two previous baby monitors. Before buying those, I did a good deal of research and each seemed to be the best on the market at the time. Well, now the market's changed. To start, the features cannot be beat, including some you'd see in other monitors: infrared night vision, the ability to talk through the monitor, temperature and humidity monitoring - and some that you might not: a night light that can change to any color in the RGB spectrum with a full intensity slider, completely customizable alerts for motion, sound, temperature & humidity (you can set the alert ranges), music that can be controlled from your phone (start, stop, volume & timer), digital zoom and panning, and charting of conditions history and record of alerts throughout the night.<br /><br />The setup was remarkably easy. It's probably slightly more difficult than your standard video monitor but given the technology involved, it's amazing how well they've designed setup. For instance, over bluetooth, your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad will send information about your WiFi connection to the monitor to get it connected the first time.<br /><br />The picture is very good - not great - but very good. It's definitely the best among video monitors I've seen. I think the resolution is sufficient, but the light sensor could benefit from being more sensitive. It seems to have to switch over to infrared too easily. The audio quality is also very good - better than our previous monitors.<br /><br />My wife and I each own an iPhone and because our phones are usually already with us, it's very convenient to be able to pull up the monitor on an app instead of having a separate monitoring device. When a sitter is over, we'll be able to show them how to use the iPad to do the same thing. So far, nighttime monitoring with the app running in the background has been working mostly without hitches. My wife told me that it stopped one night, but it hasn't happened again since - so I'm not sure what the deal was there.<br /><br />Being able to monitor it while you're away from home could come in handy. They only allow 15 minutes of monitoring per day from outside your home's connection for free, which is slightly disappointing. However, it should be sufficient for checking in on your little one who's home with the sitter while your away a few times. I don't know that there would be a need for letting the audio run while your out of the home - but you never know.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy. It's more expensive than other video monitors on the market, but the value is outstanding considering all you're getting. It'll be nice to see them fine tune and expand the software with time as well - which wouldn't be possible with most other monitors."
Baby,5.0,Baby monitor,We bought the monitor to keep a watch on our two Dalmatian dogs when we are in different parts of the house or at work. The quality of the video imagges are very good and sounds are clear. They seem to like the lullabies too!<br /><br />Great product.
Baby,4.0,good functional item,that's good fuction item. I like it.<br />I used it by cup holder and mini bag.<br />it is very conveninent.
Baby,5.0,Goes for almost 20 minutes!,"At 10 months old, we still use this toy (sans mobile, now that he can stand). It's been a lifesaver. I'm keeping it for our next baby. The songs are great and they go for a long time. The night light is just enough to be soothing and for mommy to see a bit in the dark, without distracting or waking up the baby if he's falling asleep. I never used the remote, but could see how that could be a plus, too! He turns on his songs now all by himself. It's so cute!"
Baby,4.0,Kids will love it.,"Good quality, will have to wait to see how it holds up under the baby test.  The product looks just as pictured and the packaging and shipping were as promised."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,I bought this on a whim for my son. Turns out this is my son's favorite pacifier. It's perfect for him to hold and easier to keep in his mouth. I've just bought another because I thought I lost this one.
Baby,5.0,great product,"This product is just what I was looking for that happened to come at a great price too!  I have a First Years Wave- Urban Life stroller that does not have a cup holder (which I knew before I purchased it) and so I was looking to buy one.  I wished the product offered the dimensions because I was concerned this Buggy Buddy may not stretch wide enough to fit the 20\\"" bar on the stroller.  I bought it anyway and was so pleased that it fit.  The velcro straps overlap a little more than an inch on each side which is perfect, but if your stroller is wider than 20\\"", it may not stay-- especially if you will have heavier items in there because you won't have a lot of slack in the velcro straps and it will sag if not come undone altogether.  Otherwise, the functionality is great and looks great.  I am very pleased with this product!"
Baby,4.0,Great...but wish the baby cared for them!,"These are beautiful rattles.  Plush, soft, high quality, definitely not the cheap stuff I have seen in stores.  I love them!  Unfortunately, my child could care less no matter how many times I've tried to get him to pay attention to these.  Hence the 4 stars."
Baby,4.0,A great buy!,I used this on Aprica presto flat stroller and it fits perfectly. The fabric is good and design is nice. It is a very roomy organizer and can hold a lot. I looked at other stroller organizers but chose this one based on the reviews and the great price. It also has a zippered pocket inside for ID and money but I think they could have made it more sturdy zipper bag (looks that my keys may tore the pocket) so one less star.
Baby,4.0,"Pretty nice, but has some flaws","I bought this case at Target a while back and I really like it. I small pack of the pampers sensitive wipes will fit perfectly in in. It stays closed pretty well for me, but then again I don't hang it up by the strap (like some of the other reviews complained about). I use it to grab it quickly out of the diaper bag (VERY handy). The one complaint I have is that the red cover comes off too easily so if someone else uses it for the first time, they pull it right off. It's not immediately apparent that it is supposed to slide back and forth. But, the button goes back on pretty easily too so at least it's not a fight to get it to work again. Overall, though, I think it's a pretty nice, sturdy case and I would recommend it to my friends."
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller drink Holder,I bought this drink holder to go on my Peg Perego Pliko stroller. The velcro straps are very generous in length so it fits perfectly on my stroller. It is not flimsy and holds drinks well. Also love larger pocket for wallet and zippered compartment for keys . Very pleased with purchase.
Baby,5.0,Very nifty,"This baby monitor is pretty much the coolest baby-related gadget we've purchased. It completely met my expectations.  I think it could be improved with the ability to access it from a web browser, but otherwise, good work, Withings!"
Baby,5.0,So cute!!!,OMG this toy is adorable!  We keep it attached to my son's car seat and he really seems to like it.  I love how every part of it is a new tactile experience for baby!
Baby,5.0,Excellent Option for the City Select!,"Purchased this console for my City Select, since I was really getting annoyed that it didn't have any cupholders or anything else. It works perfectly for what I need, and it was super affordable! About a third of the price of the baby jogger parent console. The great thing about it too is that you don't need to take it off of the stroller when you fold it up. Another plus is that it allows you to adjust it correctly so that it \\""hangs\\"" right (instead of some of the other consoles that attach so that the console is angled like the handles are). Buy it!"
Baby,5.0,Fantastic organizer / unbeatable price,"I bought this organizer for myself (I own a Joovy Caboose) as well as for one of my  friends ( she owns a Quinny Freestyle 3XL).<br />I must admit that I was a bit sceptical due to the low price but let me reassure you that this organizer is flat out fabulous. It easily holds four bottles, attaches to your stroller handle with easy to adjust velcro and it fits virtually every stroller model out there.<br />This is a great steal compared to all the other parent organizers out there. The only draw back is the big red logo on the  organizer but that's really it.<br />Go ahead and save yourself some money - this is a great buy!"
Baby,5.0,Works Great For UppaBaby Vista,"This fits well for the UppaBaby Vista, seems to stay put & plenty off room for drinks, Keys, phone etc.<br />The only draw back for me is that with the Vista it has the foamy kind of handle (which is the only thing I hate about the stroller)... anyhow after positioning the organizer I'm worried that the remaining velcro that is exposed will mess up the handle so I'm going to see if my husband can wrap that part of the velcro strap with some black electrical tape (hopefully it won't be noticeable)"
Baby,3.0,Good idea but ...,"I pity the non-\\""tech savvy\\"" who buy this. The instructions are pitiful. Once setup, I found that the wireless was, for the most part, useless. The functional range from the wireless router to the iBaby was measured in inches. Most people don't put the router in the baby's room. In order to get it to work, we had to put it on a wire. Wire is faster, so it's a better technical solution, but don't give me wireless that doesn't work. Feature-wise, it's great. Grandma can watch the baby from 2 hours away. You can move the camera if the baby moves out of view. You don't need a iPhone/iPad to actually watch the baby. All you need is a browser."
Baby,5.0,More affordable alternative for Baby Jogger City Mini,"This organizer works great with our Baby Jogger City Mini.  Holds two 16+ oz water bottles, small teething toys, cell phone, keys no problem.  Collapses nicely when stroller is stored without having to take it off.  Velcro straps make it easy to change from regular stroller over to jogger when we go outside."
Baby,5.0,"Horsey-themed baby toy, Sir Prance-a-Lot.","This Lamaze Early Development toy is quite colorful, cute and satiny soft. It's a good size and has more going on than a stuffed animal.  There are rings for baby to pull and the hooves squeek when squeezed (try saying that fast three times!); yet there is nothing that looks like the baby could hurt himself on. This could be baby's favorite toy!"
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"The wubanub was such a find....we discovered it through another parent at our baby class.  Our daughter loves it!  Not only is it attached the the pacifier used by hospitals, but she likes to hold the monkey and it supports her using her hands to grip things.  It's a wonderful product!"
Baby,5.0,Fantastic,"Diono is actually sunshine kids. I got this the other day and I love it!!! I have a britax b agile stroller and it works great wIth it. Velcro to keep it on the handles. One day the velcro might collect stuff and might not sick that well, but for 10$ I can't complain. The sunshine kids is $20 and this $10, it's the same exact thing. Holds my water bottle one side middle has a mesh zip pocket and a decent sized area for stuff and one more drink holder on the other side. Love it and recommend it!!"
Baby,4.0,Works great!,"Can't ask for a much better price than this! So much cheaper than the ones made specifically for my strollers. Using it on my City Mini now- only issue is that it tilts forward because of the angle of the handlebar on the stroller. It's not really a problem for me, but for some it might be a factor. The expandable cup holders are great- I put a big nalgene in there today and it fit fine. Zippered pocket is on the small side, again not a problem for me personally but for some it might be. Have to see if it fits my other stroller- if it does I will definitely be buying another one."
Baby,5.0,So far so good,"I bought this as a wipe case for my puppy and do not have children, but thought a review on another usage may be beneficial to someone.  I bought a bunch of baby wipes in bulk that did not come with a case/dispesener plus I wanted something that was portable enough to take to doggie parks or anywhere on the go to clean up puppy messes or other things so I ordered this.  This case has been super handy so far.<br /><br />It's not cute (which I would have liked), but it is durable and it seems to hold a good amount of wipes...maybe a forth to a third of the conents of one of the packs I ordered. The strap is a nice addition although we will probaby keep it in the doggie backpack with all the other dog stuff we carry around when we have the dog.  I think it would fit nicely around a stroller handle or secure nicely to a shopping cart.  Because it is see-through it is easy to tell when you need to refill.<br /><br />The dispenser works well and the wipes pull out nice and cleanly.  I think if you overfilled it, that may be a problem because you would have to shove the end of a wipe back in, but just don't overfill and it should be fine.  The top closes with a click (it is a hinged-type of closer) and I have not had any probems with the wipes drying out (but so far they have not been kept in really hot or humid environments for long). The red button slipes easily for me and the contents seem to be secure and do not shift much (but this may also have to do with the quality/thickness of wipes you buy...mine where either huggies or pampers.  I don't remember but a name brand wipe).<br /><br />So far I am pleased. Nice for one-handed access to clean dirty paws or bottoms."
Baby,5.0,Best thing ever.,"Someone gave us one of these as a gift and we thought it was funny until we started using it, now we can't live without it. Our favorite part about this pacifier is finding it in the bed at night. It is much easier to search for this than anything else. My daughter through the first one out of the car and we lost it. We only made it one night without it before we found this one online and ordered it. My only regret is not ordering 2 just in case."
Baby,4.0,Great gift,"I gave this Wubbanub as a small shower gift that I hosted for a dear friend. It was a small gathering for her 3rd baby boy and while the gift itself wasn't huge, she loved it!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect.,"All I have to say is the simple points that make this thing perfect with my Baby Jogger Summit XC:<br /><br />-Completely washable- wear resistant. Looks like nylon<br />-Easily Removable<br />-Steady and stationary, more so than the build-in plastic one on my last stroller<br />-Zip Storage pocket<br />-Two cup holders<br />-Sleek, much more sleek than the picture. Darker black and mine did not have blue embroidery for the brand label. It was Red.<br />-Low price"
Baby,4.0,Awesome gift for the year of the dragon,A coworker told me the importance of getting married or having a baby in the year of a dragon. I ordered 4 of these for myself and 3 friends who are also pregnant. They are very well made and even though the dragon is pink it's good for a boy baby too...
Baby,3.0,Cute!!,"I purchased these for my infant grandson.  They are adorable but the wrist size is for smaller infants.  My grandson is 2 mos old and these are already tight on him.  Plus at his age now, he's too young to know that they on on his hands.  The concept is great, but we'll have to see whether or not they'll fit in the next couple of months or not which should be the time he's noticing his hands more.  Currently, we just hang them from his activity mat for him to reach out to."
Baby,2.0,Really Wanted This to Be Good,"Just want to start this off by saying I really wanted this to work well.  My daughter was born in the fall and when looking for a baby monitor, I saw the Withings unit and loved the concept, Issue was at the time it was not out yet.  As soon as I got the email in Jan that it was released for the US I bought the unit.  I didn't rashly post an immediate review since I hate when people do that, so this is now my reflection after a good 2 months of use.<br /><br />Unfortunately I tried every which way to fall in love with this product, but I did have to finally return it.  There are definitely a lot of positive aspects of the unit and the SW, but a few negatives that in the end of the day made me realize this product just isn't ready for prime time.  The biggest problem is that if the unit isn't near 100% reliable, its not worth the risk when dealing with an infant.  I found myself constantly running this monitor as well as my other monitor as a backup, which is not a long term solution.<br /><br />So very quickly after unboxing I was set up, that truly was a breeze.  You initially connect via Bluetooth, but then set up over WiFi.  Had the unit set up over 3 devices (Ipad, Iphone, and Ipod touch).  I eagerly awaited the first night to test this out.<br /><br />So first reactions and several positives:<br />1. Loved the way the app worked in the background.  It didn't tie up the device, or the battery, yet still notified you and let you hear the monitor<br />2. The trending, while limited to 15 minutes, was cool to see graphically the activity on the motion and noises<br />3. The history log as well was great to see the patterns that occur through the night, be great if this could also be graphed, but that's just SW App development<br />4. The temp and humidity monitoring were also good, this was the first unit I could find that did both along with having iphone integration.<br />5. The music and lights are really bells and whistles, I don't use them, but its added features<br /><br />Most of my cons are really product design and quality.  This wouldn't be the first time I saw a great idea, for a rather expensive product fail on product quality.  Rather upsetting, but also tells me there is no hope for it being fixed until a later release.<br /><br />1. The unit is basically a large clam shell.  Its actually even a bit bigger then I expected.  When you fold it up, you literally have to point it straight forward otherwise the base gets in the way of the image.  This literally cut out about 30-40% of my crib.  After one or two times of my child crying, but being out of view I had to change something.  I literally had to make a white finished wooden wedge with a rubber top and a Velcro strap to angle the entire withings unit down to capture most of the crib.  It was better, but you shouldn't have to do that for a $300 monitor.<br />2. The night vision is really sub-par.  Man nights it took squinting to see if the baby was on her back or her stomach.  Average would have been OK, but I didn't expect it to be substantially worse that run of the mill video units.  Again, for $300 why not beef this up.<br />3. I was actually able to deal with the first 2 issues, but #3 was the game breaker.  The unit is not stable.  It disconnects and buffers endlessly on occasion. This is not anything I was comfortable taking a risk on.  I'd say realistically it was about 5-15% of the time, meaning one morning every 1-2 weeks I would awake to find out that I was not monitoring my baby all.  Scary right?  Literally the application would say you have been disconnected with your monitor and could not be reconnected.  Some times the unit buffered and never would let you actually begin monitoring.  Not all the time, but enough for me to not take a risk of not having a monitor.<br />4. From my experiences above, I can also tell you there is no quick support resolution.  You cannot call the company.  You must email and get a response back anywhere from 1-5 days.They are helpful when you get them, but being in a different time zone it was at least a day to troubleshoot each step.<br /><br />To elaborate more on #3.  The unit has Bluetooth connectivity in case the WiFi fails.  This never is sustainable, even just one room away.  My router, the monitor and the device in most cases were withing 25 feet of each other.  I even tried the unit at someone else's house to see if its my network.  I ran into the same issues.  Sometimes shutting down the apps completely and relaunching helped, but I cannot do that when I'm sleeping!  Eventually I was simply told that it would not get better and I should return the unit.  Again, any other device, I'd chalk it up to being n early adopter and take the pros and cons, but with my child, there is no risks worth taking.<br /><br />I'm hoping this helps those on the fence and also gets some attention to look at the product quality.

Baby,5.0,Love it!,This mobile is great.  Our baby loved it so much that we used it till he was 8 or 9 months old.  The battery was replaced 2-3 times over the 8-9 month timeframe.  We used it more than one time a day.
Baby,5.0,EXCELLENT!,"My 3-month old baby loves looking at this horse, grabbing it, putting it in his mouth.<br />Well made, looks great. We both love it :)"
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,"I am very happy with my monkey wubbanub. It is small enough to be comfortable for an infant.  I think it is so cute, hopefully the baby enjoys it!"
Baby,5.0,My Baby Loves this thing!,Love all the different textures on this product! I hung it on the play mat and my baby loves to grab and shake it. Received just what I ordered.
Baby,5.0,Quick Summary of Compatibility,"First-off, the Diono Buggy Buddy is identical to the Sunshine Kids version. The company has simply changed its name.<br /><br />When I first saw this product I thought, 'What a great looking product, I wonder if it would fit my stroller?' Browsing through some of the reviews I found it difficult to see if my stroller would be compatible. I thought other parents would also find this frustrating so I browsed through all of the reviews and summarized compatibility reports (as of Apr/2012). I omitted solo reports so only reports of 2 or more are included. hopefully this helps.<br /><br />2 - BJ City Elite<br />3 - BJ City Select<br />33- BJ City Mini<br />9 - BJ City Mini Double<br />2 - BJ Summit<br />7 - Bob<br />3 - Britax Light<br />6 - Britax B-Agile<br />2 - Bugaboo Cameleon<br />3 - Combi<br />6 - Graco Ipo<br />2 - Graco Duo<br />5 - Joovy Caboose<br />2 - Joovy Cooper<br />3 - Maclaren Quest<br />3 - Maclaren Techno<br />7 - Maclaren Triumph<br />3 - Maclaren Volo<br />9 - Peg Perego Aria<br />2 - Peg Perego Si<br />7 - Phil & Ted<br />4 - Quinny Zapp<br />21- Uppababy Vista<br />5 - Wheelchair<br /><br />Some quick pros and cons:<br />For ten bucks this is an excellent alternative to more expensive less convenient solutions. The buggy has lots of storage space including a zippered pocket.<br />I should note that although the buggy works well for numerous umbrella strollers, it should be removed before folding since the wiring around the top does not allow for buggy to fold with stroller. Overall 90% of the reports were 4 or 5 stars with the negatives reviews primarily reporting problems with broken straps."
Baby,4.0,works great,This product worked great with our b-agile stroller. The stroller folds easily with it on. I recommend this stroller accessory.
Baby,5.0,Works GREAT!,Love this thing.  I bought this to go with my Britax b-agile and it works perfectly!  The stroller folds up with this still attached with no problems.  Wondering if I buy another if I can somehow make it work with my Peg Perego double stroller now!
Baby,5.0,Same as the Sunshine Kids Brand but Better Price,"I bought a Sunshine Kids Stroller accessory from Amazon in the summer of 2011 for $9.98 with free shipping. We liked it so much that I wanted to buy another one for our other stroller. However, as of April 2012, the price for the Sunshine Kids brand has gone up to $23 with shipping. So, I decided to buy the Diono stroller organizer instead (which is $9.98 with free shipping). I received it last week and put it on our new stroller. It is exactly the same as the Sunshine Kids Stroller accessory but less than half the price. I'm a very satisfied customer and have now bought another Diono Buggy Buddy to give to a friend as a shower gift."
Baby,5.0,Entertaining,"Perfect for your little one. Love the variety of classical music and rainforest sounds.My son loves it and lays in his crib for hours just watching the mobile move,Plus it is cute."
Baby,5.0,Very pleased!,"This fits fantastic on my Britax B-Agile stroller. I am very pleased with the quality. The Velcro is very sturdy. I can easily put two drinks, a bottle, and cell phone in this tray. I also love that it is fabric and flexible so it condenses when I fold my stroller. Great product."
Baby,2.0,"Too heavy for the crib, going back","This mobile is way too heavy and big for my [[ASIN:B002HORL1I Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Two Tone]], which is by no means a flimsy crib. The whole thing feels top-heavy and leans towards the inside of the crib when installed. The clearance between the bottom of the mobile base and my 6.5\\"" mattress is also less than the 7\\"" minimum required according to product instructions. On top of that, the music is way too soft even on the highest setting. Therefore, the mobile is going back."
Baby,4.0,Cute and nice to have for your baby but batteries are expensive,"This product is really great and works very well. I believe it would have been better if it operates on power. The batteries are expensive and requires 3 batteries. On a regular use, set of 3 batteries would last for 2-3 weeks at most. Fisher Price should have kept an option to attach an adapter."
Baby,4.0,holds my drinks,"I like the fact that when you are ready to put the stroller in the car, the cup holder isn't in the way."
Baby,4.0,Attention-grabbing mobile,"We just put batteries in this mobile a few days ago for my 7 week old since he's starting to pay more attention to things around him.  He was immediately captivated by the animals spinning around.  The rainforest sounds are also very soothing, and I joked about using it for myself once he has outgrown it!  I don't use it to put him to sleep, but just to keep him entertained while I get quick things done. So far so good!<br />I already wish it didn't take batteries ( 3 D's) since I'm sure it will get tons of use. I haven't quite figured out how to do the different timed settings, but I know it turns off on its own and that's what really counts."
Baby,5.0,Doesn't work with City Mini GT Double,"These are great but they don't work with the Baby Jogger City Mini GT double. They work great with the regular city mini, you can use 2 and have tons of storage and cup holders. They do work with the single city mini GT."
Baby,5.0,Absolutely Adorable!!!,"This is the cutest little pacifiers ever!!!  If you a fan of monkeys, this is a must have! My new little grandson is going to love it."
Baby,5.0,Favorite toy,"My 6 month old grandson loves holding onto Sir Prance A Lot. The toy is bright, colorful, textured and the sounds amuse him. He is teething so this toy helps sooth his gums."
Baby,5.0,Exactly What I Wanted for the MacLaren Volo!,I bought this based on the great reviews and I am not disappointed. It works great on my 2011 MacLaren Volo stroller. I don't have to take it off when I fold up the stroller. Fits fast food and coffee cups as well as sippies and water bottles. I hight recommend it!
Baby,5.0,Really like this!,"Great for my 6 month old, helps keep the pacifier from falling out of his mouth while he's trying to go to sleep (he can still spit out the paci or pull it out), he likes handling the monkey and getting the pacifier in by himself.  I wish I had this when he was a newborn because it would have really helped me when I was trying to prop his pacifier and using a rolled up blanket instead (which made me nervous and I removed it after he fell asleep).  The soothie style pacifier is sewn into the mouth.  If you're looking for something compatible with other pacifiers try searching for \\""paci plushies\\""."
Baby,5.0,I use it with Baby Jogger City Mini 2011 Stroller,"I love this accessory.  I use it with my Baby Jogger City Mini 2011 Stroller.  I decided to purchase this stroller cup holder over others because it had more space for my everything (keys, cell phone, recipes, personal items, money, pacifiers.)  Plus it had two cup holders that are hold every size cup.  From a water bottle, a can of soda to fountain soda cups sizes and whatever.  I haven't found a cup that doesn't fit.  I'm never afraid that I am going to spill anything; although, it does happen.  We live in the real world but its because of user error.  If I don't take the first couple sips of something in, say a Starbucks cup, then there will be slight splashing.  But I always have wipes on hand because of the capacity.<br /><br />I'm serious when I say I love this cup holder.  I spent $10 on it when I bought my stroller as a paranoid, had to have everything, first time mom.  And I have to say its my best purchase.  I have used this product for 16 months and I never have had a problem with it.  It works great.  There is no damage to it and I use my stroller a lot.  It fits well on my stroller.  Awesome product!"
Baby,2.0,Doesn't fit crib,"This mobile is adorable, colorful and engaging. Unfortunately, it did not fit our \\""Emily\\"" crib so had to return.  Major bummer, it's the only mobile we really liked."
Baby,5.0,"If you are pregnant, BUY this mobile!","We bought this a month after our son was born and he has progressed from:<br />1. gazing at the animals with the mobile off (probably looking at the bright colors)<br />2. visually tracking each animal as it moves in circles.<br />3. talking to the animals.<br />4. grabbing at them and laughing.<br /><br />He is now 3 months old and this mobile is a lifesaver for me. For instance, when I need to take a shower in the morning, I place him in the crib with the mobile on and I have at least 20 minutes to get back to him. When the mobile turns off automatically, he will let me know. The only thing I don't use is the remote control. Overall, GREAT product."
Baby,5.0,best stroller accessory ever,"i have a phil&ted's explorer and, other than theirs (which i refused to spend $30 on), no cupholders worked.  they either kept slipping or couldn't make it over the rather thick handles/frame.  this thing is great--you can make it as loose or tight as you want and it's surprisingly stable.  plus, in addition to space for two beverages, there's room to stick the random baby/toddler items that endlessly drop from the stroller (i.e. hats, socks, toys).  so wish i had found this a year ago when we got the stroller.  GREAT PRICE!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my Britax B-Agile,"After initially purchasing the adult cupholder from Britax and becoming quickly frustrated with it, I began my search for something different. I ordered the Diono Buggy Buddy after reading so many great reviews, and it is exactly what I needed. I love that it folds up easily with my stroller and holds two large drinks securely. I was also pleasantly surprised that the middle compartment is large enough for my Nikon DSLR, phone, and wallet. I would definitely buy again!"
Baby,4.0,Good product for the price!,"This fits perfectly on my City-Mini stroller and seems durably built. My only complaint is that it is a tad small, but totally adequate for neighborhood strolls."
Baby,2.0,Great Hardware with Terrible Software,"I've been using the iBaby monitor for over 4 months now. I think that this is a great piece of hardware that is limited by really bad software. Every time there is a software update, one issue gets fixed, and two new issues appear. This company needs to get their act together and fix this issues, some of which are really easy to fix. With the latest iPhone app update, the software crashes after about 5 minutes of operation. This is unacceptable because my child's life is at stake."
Baby,2.0,Disappointed,"We purchased this mobile after seeing all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I guess we're in the minority. When the mobile arrived the music worked but the motor did not. We had to take it apart and fix it before we could get it to turn. Then, one of the leaves wouldn't work correctly (it stayed stuck in the up position unless you manually tapped on it). I also agree with other reviews about the music being a little too quiet. It's too bad because our daughter did seem to enjoy watching it turn. Anyway, this was a return item for us."
Baby,5.0,GREAT!,"This product is fantastic.<br />great styling and perfectly functioning. everything you would expect.<br />we tried another one that was slightly cheaper but the image quality was terrible and you couldn't zoom.<br />this has great picture in day or night vision.<br />Easy to setup, connects via wifi or ethernet.<br />the magnetic mount is strong yet incredibly easy to move.<br />night vision works perfectly, and the temperature sensor comes in very very handy with baby.<br />I like that when i am on the road i can login and see if the baby is sleeping.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the wifi doesn't support 5ghz networks."
Baby,5.0,Best Mobile Ever!!!,"Bought this for my 3rd child last fall. This is the best mobile I've ever had. This was one of the first things my infant's eyes focused on and it was the first thing that made him laugh. Even now as an 8 month old, I can calm him down with it. The music is soothing, there's volume control, a remote , and a nightlight. I'm so sad that I will have to take it down when he begins to pull himself up. Right now he's reaching for the buttons on it. LOVE IT!!!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent monitor,"We have been very happy with this product. Great picture quality, sound quality, and the features like temp/humidity control are fantastic.  I honestly haven't used all the other bells and whistles yet (music, night light, etc.)- but it's nice to know they are there.  My husband travels a lot, so it's nice for him to be able to check in on our daughter remotely via his iPhone when he's out of town.<br />Thought it was very easy to set up, and it looks nice (very compact)."
Baby,5.0,If you have a baby get this product!,"I ordered this when my son was 2 1/2 months old. He loved it so much,  I ordered him two more. He is now almost 8 monts old and I don't know how I could have survived without them! To the people complaining you can't clean the pacifier or baby, just throw it in the washing machine, delicate cycle and tumble dry low. it comes out good as new. New parents,do not hesitate to get this, it is a lifesaver!"
Baby,5.0,Love this helpful compartment!,"Bought this to attach to our Baby Jogger City Mini and love it!  It's simple, but helpful for drinks, keys, phones, or anything else you want close at hand when walking with baby.  Highly recommend!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent Product,"The Withings Baby Monitor is an excellent product, I originally purchased the ibaby, and when i opened the box, i found wires upon wires that needed to be attached to the monitor.  I'm sorry but I'm not connecting a power cord, speaker wires and an ethernet cable all hanging off my crib so i returnd it the following day.  I read a lot of mixed reviews and was skeptical with the Withings monitor that I just purchased.  At first the setup was pretty simple and went along with the instruction manual.  The only problems I found was on the technical side of the house when attaching the monitor to \\""MY\\"" wireless network, but with the excellent customer service contacts and mathieu, you shouldn't have any problems.  Just remember when turning monitor off and on, you have to reconnect the monitor to your wireless network, doesn't take long at all.  My wife's family all live abroad and this monitor plays a big part in our lives because of the time zone difference.  We have it set up, and we can hear her parents and mine talking to our daughter or playing her a lullaby with a nightlight all while she's in her playpen or crib, because did i mention it's portable, Bwahhhh...Again, Thank You Withings for an excellent product.<br /><br />Mahalo Nui Loa from Hawaii"
Baby,5.0,He likes it!,My 2 month old spends tummy time in this and he likes checking out the little mirror. I like that it's small.
Baby,5.0,Made a proud purchase!,"My 8mo-old son loves loves loves it!  We set up his crib with this mobile since he was 4mo, he has been loving it ever since.  The moving up and down leafs and the spinning animals are all very entertaining.  Whenever I turn it on, he would happily flap his arms and kick his legs with a big smile on his face.  He loves to gaze at the light-up graphic while listening to the forest sound or music.  I personally do not like the songs very much, but seems like some how babies love them.  Although my son cannot really fall in sleep with the mobile turned on, it keeps him wide awake instead, but it keeps him happy and occupied.  Also this is the only mobile I could find that have the spining animals facing DOWNWARD, a mobile is meant to be looked at from the bottom where baby is, not side view where parents are."
Baby,5.0,Big tooth dragon!,My husband picked this toy for our daughter because of the large teeth on the dragon! We have an on going joke about my large smile :D We love this toy! The crinkle wings are my daughters favorite part. She also liked the mirror on the tail and the rattle. I worry that like other reviewers said about her maybe hitting herself with the rattle but I will cut it off if I see a problem. Even if I have to do that I still LOVE this toy and so does my daughter! Very cute dragon!!
Baby,5.0,Excellent product,"I recently purchased a City Mini stroller and needed to find a solution for holding beverages and keys, etc.  I can't say enough about this product.  My old stroller had a plastic tray to hold items and because I was accustomed to using the tray I was apprehensive about purchasing the City Mini because it didn't have a tray.  This is SO much better than a tray!  I'm so glad I didn't purchase another stroller because the Mini lacked a tray (I love the City Mini stroller).  This storage solution is better than a stroller tray because your items (keys, wallets, toys, etc.) sit inside the pouch and unlike a tray, they are not in clear view.  The cup holders are fantastic because they expand to fit most beverages.  It also folds perfectly with the stroller.  This product really is an unbelievable storage solution for the price.  Don't waste your money on more expensive products; you won't be sorry if you purchase this."
Baby,2.0,Impossible to setup for viewing outside home nework,"I bought this camera so when I had to travel for work I could peek in on my little man at night. However, the networking set up for viewing outside your home network for this application is a nightmare! It was pretty easy to get it to work on the home network, but that (in my opinion) is only getting half use out of this expensive monitor.  I had to contact iBaby for support and my network provider for help with port forwarding (which they charge you for tech support).  Finally I just gave up.  It shouldn't be this difficult!  On top of all that, the application crashes too often and is not reliable in any way as a singular monitor device for your child.  You can't know when it might just stop working in the middle of the night.<br /><br />So- I have returned this item.  The camera had a good picture, but the networking set up and application crashing is too horrible to make this a usable product.  Until these 2 items are better I will just settle for a standard video monitor that I can count on to work.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- good video picture<br /><br />Con:<br />- terrible application - crashes all the time<br />- difficult (impossible) network set up for viewing off the home network (i.e. when traveling)"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my needs,"This was simple and perfect for my needs. My husband and I are both able to fit our Starbucks in the cup holders during our shopping trips and there's a center compartment to hold my cell phone, pacifier, etc. Couldn't beat it for the price!"
Baby,5.0,Stroller holder,It came in the mail super fast & it was exactly what I expected!! It also ended up matching the stroller perfectly. I love that it has a pocket inside & that's it's thermal. Thanks!
Baby,5.0,Love it!,I just got this in today and my 5 month old already loves it. We hang it from his car seat and he loves it. It keeps his attention and he loves putting the different textures in his mouth. I would recommend this to anyone.
Baby,5.0,Same hospital pacifier material and I haven't lost one yet!,"I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free."
Baby,4.0,Foot Finders,"They are not elastic to fit babies' feet. I guess that's how they stay on. They didn't help my daughter to find her feet. I put them on her when I first bought them, but she didn't notice them at all. She then found her feet herself and really showed interest in them. However, it's kind of too late. They are now almost too small to wear!"
Baby,4.0,Great camera,"I love everything overall, the only issue I have is the night vision isn't quite as clear as I would like.  Everything else though is fantastic."
Baby,4.0,Lovely Mobile,We got this mobile and are overall very pleased with it.<br /><br />When it was about a month old it suddenly stopped working. We called Fischer Price and they sent us a new one. It has been a few months and that one still works great.<br /><br />My son loves it. He has been entranced with it since we got it. He loves the animals as well as the light in the music box. He falls asleep to it almost every night.<br /><br />It is great for keeping LO occupied and happy.
Baby,5.0,Versatile and worthwhile,Having a newborn means that you live in world of disarray.  It also means that you are perpetually and endlessly washing bottles and making formula.  Half the time we can't find a nipple and just need to seal the bottle and get it in the fridge--ENTER these bottle sealing discs.<br /><br />They create a tight seal and pop in and out easily.  They will also prove useful later on if we want to use a bottle to hold cheerios or fruit loops:)
Baby,5.0,Handy,"This came super quick (like the next day). It is very handy and works well with my britax b-agile, i didnt want to pay a lot for something so minor. I am very satisfied with my purchase"
Baby,5.0,The only pacifier my son uses,"My son has about 4 of these wubba nubs now. It is the only pacifier he will take. They are easy to clean, and impossible to loose."
Baby,5.0,New Nana,"I love this Item! I was afraid that it was going to be a hard plastic disc, but it's not it's made of rubber. It's flexible snaps and stays in the bottle ring to make a tight seal (without the nipple inside the bottle."
Baby,1.0,poor quality!!,We purchased 2 separate wubbanubs and were dissatisfied with both of them.  They both began popping seams and stuffing coming out of them within the first 3 weeks.  Out child was 3 weeks old and obviously not harming them in any way... just poor poor quality! Then when contacting the company and dealing with them they sent another... which has ZERO stuffing in it... they asked to send us another but after 3 out of 4 wubbanubs being broken we had had enough!
Baby,5.0,Amazing,Its important device if u have a baby and want to see him/ her all the time. Easy to use. Very good quality.
Baby,4.0,Great stroller organizer,I was looking for a stroller organizer to fit my Maclaren Volo so that I could at least put a sippy cup in there along with my water bottle and this gets the job done. It's actually pretty sturdy and hold drinks upright without a problem. I gave it four stars because I can't fold it down with the stroller.
Baby,1.0,Not worth the hassle!!!,"Really wanted this product to work  and gave it tons of tries, but it simply doesn't work!! I thought we bought a faulty one. Returned it, set up a new one, and gave it another shot only to find the same results. It worked properly for the first two days and then comes the endless buffering!! No way to call the company for customer support and slow e-mail response time!! Cant take the risk with our baby!! Ends up being a $300 paper weight!!!"
Baby,3.0,Not good enough yet..,"As an IT engineer I picked this up for the ability to use our home network and any of the Ipad's or Iphones that we have in the house; as well as the techie part. It was very easy to setup, at least for me. The video does have a good bit of lag/latency and the quality is not as good as I expected. My home network does not use \\""consumer/home\\"" grade products such as 99% of the individuals who would be using a product like this as it is not cost effective to have 10K bucks in networking equipment for home connectivity. This was running over a pure Cisco enterprise level network with Cisco Aironet AP's with QOS setup to give the camera/video traffic priority over any other type of traffic but that only gave me a slight performance increase. The Aironet series also uses \\""clean air technology\\"" so interference from other sources is non existent . I also tried it on the wired side plugged into a Cisco Catalyst 3750 switch and still the same results. The audio had a pretty big lag as well and when playing the lullaby and listening to it over the iPhone/iPad there was a ton of overlap if you were anywhere close to being able to hear both at the same time; This was due to the latency. I think it is a great concept but the codec's need to be adjusted and the frame rate increased. We also purchased the Motorola setup to compare and even though I can't access it from \\""anywhere\\"" the voice/video has zero latency and it just flat out works out of the box which will keep my wife happy. I will set up one of my HD Axis camera's for local and remote viewing that is not limited to Apple products; also this will be free for me and will produce MUCH voice and video quality that the Withings unit can ever think about doing.. The Withings unit will be returned tomorrow to the Apple store.. Get the Voice and Video as good as the Motorola unit and I would buy it again for the techie aspect of it."
Baby,4.0,"Good item, great price!","I bought this because I read on the reviews that it fits the Britax B Agile well...<br /><br />Honestly it doesn't fit the stroller that well, especially when the stroller seat is laying down. It will work though! Good item for the price!"
Baby,4.0,Great parent tray for the price,This is a very good parent tray for the price.  I use this on my Britax B-Agile stroller and it does the job.  What I like is the stretchy pockets for drinks to accomodate different size containers.  What I wish it had was a cover over the main pocket to keep things dry and to prevent things from falling out when you fold the stroller up.  All in all I am happy with this purchase.
Baby,1.0,not worth the price and seems a hazard,"I purchased this the other day before reading reviews.  It looked cute and colorful.  It is very small, has very few toys and afer assembling it I discovered not only was the giraffe velcro piece coming detached but that particular piece doesn't come with a toy.  I am not crazy at the idea that the toys velcro instead of being stationary or having links to hold them in place.  I read another review on the site I purchased it from that a Mother's baby choked on the butterflies after removing them by grabbing ahold of them.  Her father discovered her choking child thankfully.  The tiger only plays 2 tunes and not nearly long enough. The only plus I would even consider giving this is the bright colors and easy assembly but simply not worth it!  I can see it becoming an easy bore for any baby."
Baby,3.0,just okay,"I ordered one of these for my city mini double stroller and it is an average product.  It is a nice heavy canvas.  I like the compartments and it has a mesh zipper area inside the middle compartment.  I do not like that it sits so close to the handle bar that it is awkward to use water bottles and impossible to use any liquid holding device that is not completely sealed- which really is the main reason I bought this.<br /><br />Update a year later- the wire piece that goes around the basket is now poking out of the fabric.  This works okay with kids cups but not with my drinks- like a store-bought coffee with a lid. Basically, I use it to hold little pieces of trash or my keys when we are on a walk. I never use the zipper compartment bc it is too hard to get to."
Baby,5.0,Back for more!,I've used the sunshine kids model for the past 2 years and recently had to purchase the diono one as a replacement. I wore out the velco after what I would consider excessive use. I'm certain that most people wouldn't have issues with wearing this out. It is very well made and extremely useful to me. I have a BJ city select and use it daily during the warmer months. It fits many different sized sippy cups or mommy cups and even keeps drinks cool with insulated fabric(think soda can cozy). I would buy this again and again! I think I definitely got my moneys worth out of it for 2 years and know I'll be using this one for at least another 2.
Baby,5.0,nice mobile,"Very soothing and nice looking mobile. Leaves are adorable. Animals are cute.<br />Our daughter likes it a lot already. She keeps staring at it. Music is fine too, but I personally like the nature sounds more.<br />And it was really easy to put together. It runs almost 3 weeks on 3 d-size batteries.<br />Remote control is nice but I don't really use it."
Baby,5.0,Works fine. Good price.,This works well with my Britax B-Agile. It doesn't interfere with the folding of the stroller. It holds cups of various sizes securely. Another great product from Diono!
Baby,5.0,So convenient,"Very convenient, fits 2 water bottles, baby snacks, keys, phone ... I like the way it attaches on the stroller handle, so it hangs vertically with gravity. I used the Joovy organizer for a while but it covers the handle and, because of the handle angle, it attaches in a horizontal position, which is not convenient, to me anyway.<br />I love the price too. I just bought the Diono so I am hoping it will last long enough."
Baby,5.0,Great for little ones!,"My son loved this toy from birth.  I hung it on his bouncy seat and he would stare at it for long periods of time.  Now that he is 4 months old, he loves grabbing the legs and chewing on the different toys attached to them.  I liked it so much that I bought another as a gift for a friend's baby shower."
Baby,1.0,Seems dangerous??,"I have seen these in stores and online and I am curious as to why someone would put a plush animal so close to the nose and mouth of an infant? Hasnt anyone heard of SIDS?? Maybe I am a bit paranoid, but why risk it? The first thing we tell new parents is to keep plush animals and blankets away from babies faces. So again, why do this? Sure its \\""cute\\"" but it just seems risky."
Baby,5.0,great gift for a great family!!!,"The device works great! Perfomes just as it has too, as looked up online, book, or magazine!!! I would recommend it for all new parents and they're friends if they are buying gifts!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect Purchase,"I got this for my Peg Perego Si stroller.  The bottle holder it included was pretty useless and I like having a place to stick a drink, my phone and keys!  This easily attached and I don't even have to remove it to collapse the stroller.  It has plenty of space for water or coffee and it stands upright so I don't worry about my beverages spilling.  This works great for me and is a wonderful price!"
Baby,5.0,Solid device and capabilities but did not work for me,"Compared numerous devices and decided on the Withings due to iPad and iPhone interface and excellent baby monitor features. Use and testing were positive when used on simple network configurations (99.9% of consumers) and keeping the device on the same network. We did have communication issues with Cisco business class router with multiple wireless access points. Returned the device because resetting the device to resolve issues and using on various networks (though same SSID and credentials) was not ideal. That being said, I have not found another that will (still looking and testing). The tech support was well educated and return process was simple. Overall, I recommend this product and company."
Baby,4.0,Great product,Great product  with  alot of functions but i faced a problem connecting it to the internet which was solved after i contacted it via ethernet cable
Baby,4.0,I bought 4!,"Great product that would have got 5 stars had it been easier to set up. I used to have dlink DCS-2120's around the property but they did not work nice with my new Time Capsule router. I purchased my first iBaby and had it up and running on LAN and Internet within 5 minutes. Documentation was horrible but logic came into play and it wasnt too hard in the end. The camera is good and the permanently on infra red LED's are hardly noticeable and really do great in dark environments. They are not glaring lights as one reviewer commented (a reviewer who apparently works for a competing camera company I might add!). I now have 4 set up and the wireless range has been no issue at all (OK, I do have 3 Airport Extremes around the house as well as the Time Capsule!). Motion detection and sound detection alarms are all set up and working fine. A gripe is the seeming impossibility of turning off the alarms on my iphone (without lowering volume) but hey ho. I am a very satisfied customer with a working security set up in my home. I am currently sitting in my office using my iphone to watch my cat fool around in my pitch black basement at home on IR."
Baby,5.0,Excellent,"the service is very good and the quality of the monitor is excellent, the resolution you have at night is incredible and I can stay connected from anywhere to monitor"
Baby,4.0,Awesome wipes case,"This is the second one of these I've bought. I lost the first one. I love this case because it is actually big enough to hold wipes for two kids in diapers. The design allows you to get out just one at a time instead of accordion pulling 10 at once. I gave it four stars because the red sliding button is a tad difficult to open one handed, but that's not too bad once you get the hang of it. Love the style, love the concept, and it would make an awesome baby shower gift too."
Baby,5.0,"Fits great, saves money",Fits the BOB perfectly and has more storage than the BOB cup holder. Very happy with my purchase. Also pleased with the price and durability.
Baby,3.0,These are OK.,"They are a little hard to get on, I think using wrist rattles would have been more effective. The material isn't shaped like a sock and it isn't very strechy so they are hard to get on and they just come right off. My girls love the actual bug on them and the colors are good. So I am only giving 3 stars. Not great but not awful, it gets a shoulder shrug."
Baby,5.0,love it,Very cute. Bright colors. Easy to put on baby hand. My little girl loves this toy. I would recommend this item to anybody. Good quality.
Baby,5.0,Very easy to open and close,"It is a very useful case, you can open it really easy, it's the best i've ever seen. I've had others before and it was a problem to open and close them, but with this you don't make any effort!"
Baby,3.0,lots of fun: Edit: motor died :(,"So there are a LOT of reviews on this thing, good and bad. I thought I would throw mine into the loop as well.<br />Firstly, my daughter loves this, she plays with it and watches it and overall really enjoys it.<br />Many people complain that this is too quiet, here is my thoughts on it. The low volume is pretty quiet, especially the nature sounds, however it is definitely loud enough for baby. The high volume is loud, but not too loud. I can hear it in the hall, but with the door closed, I really have to listen for it. My daughter is use to a lot of noise, so the loud setting works well when she is just playing with it, the low volume for when she is trying to sleep.<br />Many people also claimed it does not fit on a convertible crib, I have a convertible crib and it fits fine. If you want it on the head/ foot board of the crib, it will not fit most cribs as they have a solid top these days. It is meant to go on the side of the crib- it fits well there if you have a straight edged crib. Essentially it has a big plastic bolt and washer- you put the bolt through the slats and spin on the washer until it's tight.<br />I have had this for about three weeks and I have not had any problems with any of the leaves as others have complained about, nor has the motor caused any problems. I am thinking those people just got a bad one, it happens but I don't think it should stop anyone from buying this. It is a great product!<br />My almost 3 month old use to hate being in her crib, awake or asleep, it was too big and open for her. Now that she has this mobile, she loves to watch it and play with it in her crib. She has started taking naps in her crib because of this mobile, it is now a friendly place for her (I am sure that would have happened over time, but it is great to have that happen now as she is outgrowing where she sleeps in now). My only complaint is I wish it had a continuous play mode as sometimes she wakes up when it turns off.<br /><br />***EDIT*** The motor justdied. We didn't even have it for a full month. Very disappointing, my daughter really liked this. At least it helped her learn to enjoy her crib. I was sad to return it, but at least Amazon makes it easy to return. Upon reading other mobile reviews it seems that Fisher Price motors die frequently."
Baby,1.0,not satisfied,"We thought this paci would stay in better because the stuffed animal would lay next to baby in the crib and sort of hold it in place. Thats what we concluded after reading the back story of the wubbanub. It would work if it was big enough, but its not. Very light weight and wont reach the crib bed when baby is on his back. Just kinda hangs there a bit til it falls out. Also has that made in china/ carnival prize type of quality feel to it. We found that the standard paci works better because with the wubbanub baby actually catches the stuffed animal with his arms when he flails them and it rips the paci out of his mouth. Definitely NOT worth the $13 they are asking for these things, even if you get free super saver shipping."
Baby,5.0,My baby's favourite toy,"I bought this toy just to keep my baby busy when she is in her car seat but she loved this toy so much that I attached it to her rocker and she plays with it several times a day.<br /><br />Each leg has a different sensory stimulating activity. There is a black and white rattle, a mirror, a red flat teether and a bead chaser with multiple textures. The giraffe in itself is quite attractive. It is said that a  baby less than 5 month old likes black, white, yellow and red. This toy has all these colors.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this is one of the very few toys that lasts long . I bought it when my baby was 2 months old. At that time she  used to stare at the rattle and mirror. At 3 and 4 months, she would bat at the toys. Now at 5 months, she would put everything in her mouth. Except for the rattle, everything is easy to chew on and that helps her when she has teething discomfort.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy."
Baby,4.0,pretty nice organizer!,"This Diono organizer is easy to set up and use it! I took it up when I fold my Maclaren tech stroller just in case for not letting the organizer get twice, but I just found out that I don't even need to take it out because it don't bother to fold with it."
Baby,5.0,A great toy,I love how this toy is unlike many of the others you see more frequently of this type.  It really caught my 4month old's attention.  What's great about it is there are bright bold colours and patterns to appeal to all ages but also that black and white print which seems to appeal to younger babies.  It also has a small mirror dangling from one foot which she loves to stare at and grab. The texture of the plastic is also great for her to touch.  It feels very much like a quality product.
Baby,5.0,"simple, affordable and extremely useful!","This organizer is simple, affordable and extremely useful!  It doesn't get in the way of the folding of my Baby Jogger City Mini GT.  The fact that it is flexible and kind of swings from the handle ensures that nothing spills out on bumps.  It's easily removed if necessary (I've never found it to be necessary).  I'd certainly buy it again."
Baby,5.0,A must have!,"We bought this for our Inglesina Swift. It fits perfectly. This is such a handy addition! We use one cup holder for our daughters sippy cup and another for our bottled water. The main pocket fits our phones and snacks for her. Also, it does not interfere with opening and closing the stroller. We love it!"
Baby,5.0,Great Monitor,"I have been using this monitor for a few weeks now with my new baby and am really satisfied.  I know there are other ways to get this done with setting up IP cameras and making security cameras work for this purpose, but for overall design I don't think there is any comparison.  The recent app update has been working very well for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1-Hardware is nicely designed and the build quality seems very good.<br />2-If you have multiple iOS devices this is a great product.  Love how we can have multiple monitors going at once.<br />3-Nice \\""hidden\\"" features like it works as a traditional audio only monitor if you close the unit and the app can be configured to play the audio in the background when the app is exited.<br />4-Can configure to use 2 wifi networks and will default back to bluetooth if off your network (bluetooth range is very limited).<br />5-Had issues at first with push notifications not working after recent app update.  Emailed support and received a response in less than one day and they acknowledged there was an issue on their side that would be corrected in about a day (and it was).<br />6-Really like the fifteen minute visual graph of motion and noise.  Temp and humidity are helpful.<br />7-Great nightlight.<br />8-Nightvision has been working pretty well with one exception.<br />9-Off network connection is seamless.<br />10- Configurable notifications.<br />11- My wife knows how to use it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1-The battery is really not that useful as it is reported it will only work for 1 hour with video and 2 with audio.  Really just useful to move the unit from one area to the next.<br />2- It is expensive, but not the most expensive option.  There are many video monitors that do less but cost more.<br />3- The music options are pretty limited, but the last app update listed that support was being built in for more options.<br />4- No website connectivity, only can be viewed over iOS devices.<br />5- Off network viewing limited to 15 minutes per day (reported you can buy more time but not yet available).<br />6- Their account services web site is not really ready for use and it is confusing what it will even be for.<br />7- Little odd details with the app like it is not very clear with the custom notifications for motion and noise as to which way the slider makes the sensor more or less sensitive.<br />8- I have noticed that in some light levels the camera seems to get confused and flips back and forth from night to day vision.<br /><br />Overall very happy and would not hesitate to fully recommend this device.  Most importantly the app and push notifications have been very reliable (after recent bug update).  I was initially concerned that I would miss my baby crying or moving.<br /><br />7- There is a slight delay with video and audio (0.5 to 1 second maybe).to 15 minutes per day (reported you can buy more time but not yet available).<br />6- Their account services web site is not really ready for use and it is confusing what it will even be for.<br />7- Little odd details with the app like it is not very clear with the custom notifications for motion and noise as to which way the slider makes the sensor more or less sensitive.<br />8- I have noticed that in some light levels the camera seems to get confused and flips back and forth from night to day vision.<br /><br />Overall very happy and would not hesitate to fully recommend this device.

Baby,5.0,great product,we bought this to go on our new britax b-nimble stroller- its great!  I can only say great things about this product.  We keep it on the stroller and have no problems even folding the stroller up with it still attached.  very helpful and can hold quite a bit!
Baby,5.0,"Amazing monitor, perfect now that it has 3G","This monitor works great. The video is great quality, the nightlight is perfect for seeing when you come in the room. It works great on my iPad and iPhone. And now that 3 G is free, I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
Baby,5.0,Fits Aprica Stroller,"I never write reviews, but this is the best cup holder and organizer for the money. It also fits my Aprica Presto Flat stroller. I can even fold the stroller with the organizer left on it. I would highly recommend this product."
Baby,4.0,My son loved this until the motor died,I bought this because it was colorful and the reviews were good. I was pleased when I put it together. It matched with our decor and the music is pleasant. There is a low setting for sound so it won't be too loud. My husband even enjoys going to sleep with its tunes. When my son was a newborn it didnt too much for him. But when he was about 2 months he enjoyed looking at the animals. He squeals and is so excited and it can keep him entertained for a good half hour. Now most of the time the mobile can put him to sleep at 4 months. BUT this week the motor died! The music still plays but the animals won't turn. He's really disappointed. I'm gonna call Fisher Price and make them fix it.
Baby,5.0,My son LOVES his monkey Wubbanub!,"My 3 1/2 month old has been attached to his monkey since he was about 3 weeks old. He doesnt need/use the pacifier for longer than a few minutes, but his face lights up when he sees his monkey. When he started day care I made sure it went with him so that he would having something familiar and comforting with him during the day. It has defintely helped him develop his dexterity and can easily reach for/handle the monkey."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for City Select,"I bought this for my Baby Jogger City Select and it works perfectly.  I keep it snugged up against the top of the handle and I still have room for my toddlers to ride on the glider board. The only downside I can think of is the lack of cover.  If it rains, your phone is getting wet!"
Baby,5.0,Great accessory to have!,"Bought this stroller organized for my Britax B-Agile stroller and couldn't be happier with it! It's inexpensive, fits well, and has plenty of storage.  Perfect accessory for the Britax without the price tag."
Baby,5.0,liked it a lot,"owned it for a few month , like it. fast shiping.didnt have any problems with the item or the service."
Baby,5.0,My Baby loves it!,A great mobile. Colorful and with four nice melodies that don't grate on your nerves like some other products do! My baby loves this mobile and loved watching it go round from birth on. She's 8 months old now and still loves it! A great product at a great price. Also consumes less battery than i had thought it would.
Baby,4.0,Good one,Nice one. Took this for diaper cacke decoration. Very soft toy. Good for infants. Does not get hurt. Can be used as teether.
Baby,5.0,How Cute is this!!!,"I ordered the Wubbanub Monkey for my expecting daughter-in-law.  She has decided my grandson's nickname is going to be \\""lil monkey\\"".  I thought this would be a perfect little gift to add to my growing collection of gifts for my first grandbaby.  My daughter in law loves, loves, loves this monkey.  She said it was her favorite gift at her recent baby shower. Even though my grandson is not born yet, I am sure this pacifier will always be his favorite."
Baby,4.0,"Great, but needs improvement","I've been waiting nearly a year for this thing... It came out in January 2012 but my husband and I decided that it was a bit late in the game to be buying a new monitor, especially a $300 one, since our son was nearly a year old at the time.  However, 15 months to the day after we set it up, our old monitor gave out, so we decided to buy this one.<br /><br />+We love that my husband can check in on our son when he's at work or away on a trip.  I believe initially, you had to pay to view more than 15 minutes per day, but as of late May 2012, that doesn't seem to be the case.  My husband has been spying on the nursery all day long.<br />+I love not having to drag another thing around the house with me.  If the house is quiet, you can hear the baby anywhere, but you can't hear him over the TV.  It's really nice to just start the app on my iPhone when we turn a movie on, and not have to worry about going and dragging out the monitor handset, finding a place to plug it in AND set it up so we can see.  I just peek at my phone if we hear a noise, and check whether he's just stirring in his sleep or if there's a problem.<br />+Multiple devices at once!!  We have two iPhones and an iPad viewing him at the same time, very frequently.  I leave the iPad connected upstairs and never touch it, and use the iPhone app when I'm downstairs.  I haven't tried any more than that, but I haven't noticed any change in performance with more or less devices connected.<br />+Runs on a battery!  Sure, it won't last all night, but the sucker doesn't stop running when the power goes out or when you accidentally unplug it!  Apparently it's rated for one hour of video or two hours of audio monitoring, but I haven't tested that, and I'm not sure I will any time soon.<br />+ Easy to set up, right out of the box.  I plugged it in, turned it on, and was monitoring within 5 minutes.<br />+The alerts are awesome.  I love knowing what the temperature and humidity are in the room, and I can set up a motion alert that will wake me before my son gets upset in the mornings.<br />+Creepy disembodied voice feature lets you use the monitor like an intercom, and talk to your child.<br />+Lullaby feature is cute.  There aren't a ton of songs, but it's not a crib soother, it's a monitor.  It's a neat feature.<br />+The night light is 100% adjustable, and each color varies in brightness, so you can set what's right for you.  The night light does not appear to interfere with the camera's night vision.<br /><br />-Lag.  Unless the kid has a gun in the crib, a 1-second lag isn't going to be a problem, but it is annoying.  I've noticed that if you leave a device connected for an extended period of time, the lag time increases marginally, but if you turn monitoring off then back on, it goes away.  It's generally about .5-1 second in my house, over wifi connection.<br />-Design flaw in the night vision.  I noticed that the picture was very clear most of the time, but had a strange brightness to it when night vision was activated, but that sometimes it wasn't present.  As it turns out, the \\""night vision\\"" lights are reflected off of the shiny plastic base, and interfere with the camera.  I covered the base with a small piece of fleece I had lying around, and the night vision is incredibly clear.  It doesn't bother me, but for $300, I shouldn't have to do that.<br />-This is more of a note... the plug is kinda wiggly.  It's not normally an issue, but if you touch the monitor a lot, the plug can come loose from the base, and the camera will die.  Fortunately, the monitor tells you that!  And hopefully your little one is blissfully unconscious so you can sneak in and fix it.<br />-No discount for multi-room viewing.  A lot of monitors are set up in such a way that you can just buy an extra camera and view it on the same connection.  However, since this is an all-in-one bit, you have to buy the whole thing twice if you have two rooms to monitor.  I will probably never NEED two rooms monitored by video, but I probably would have bought the extra camera if it was offered (and cheaper), rather than using just a cheap audio monitor for the toddler when baby #2 comes along.<br /><br />=No REAL pan/zoom.  Our previous monitor had a joystick-controlled mechanical pan/zoom function.  This camera just uses a very wide angle lens to get the most complete picture possible, and you can digitally pan and zoom around that picture, but the camera never moves.  It hasn't been a problem for us, but there it is.<br />=Camera/base design flaw.  You do have to point the camera on the base at a certain angle, otherwise the base interferes in the camera, and you get even more of that awful glare.  When it comes to video baby monitors, this whole situation is tricky anyways, since there's the whole problem of trying to see over the rails of the crib.  No matter what, you're probably going to want the thing mounted high up, and pointing straight down.  This goes for any baby monitor.  Temporarily, we have ours propped up so that it's pointing kind of downward, but I'll be mounting it on the wall later.  It comes with an attachment to secure it to the crib, but that will only work for smaller babies who can't yet sit up and grab things.  :)<br />=iOS ONLY!  I'm not listing this as a negative item, because it is also positive, while it can possibly be inconvenient.  No, I can't watch from the computer (YET- rumor has it that Withings is working on this, and there may be an OSX app in the future).  However, this means that for anyone to be able to access my monitor, they have to be within range of it to make the initial connection, which then alerts all my devices that a connection has been made.  I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like I can disable accounts from viewing my monitor.<br /><br />Some people have reported problems getting connected and staying connected, but I haven't experienced it personally.  I also haven't needed to contact customer service, so I can't elaborate on that either.<br /><br />Overall, I like the monitor, and I'd still choose this one over others on the market.  It has a few minor issues, but they're more like annoyances, and there are no security issues or major flaws.  It would be a different story if the world of baby monitors was as advanced and high-demand as smartphones, but it's not.  And so far, this monitor is one of the best available."
Baby,4.0,Good stuff,Good product and much better value than BOB. Has a nice larger middle compartment that is deep enough to hold what you might need on an outing.
Baby,5.0,Fastastic and adorable,"Our baby loved this, and it is easy for an infant to hold and not lose.  Even after stopping all other pacifiers he loves to have this with him in the car.<br /><br />We have also bought these for two baby showers and the parents loved them.  They get more oohs and ahhs that much more expensive gifts."
Baby,5.0,Fabulous,Picked one up yesterday and our one month old has been happy and content all day! First time we put him to bed without crying. Definitely a gift for every new parent.
Baby,2.0,stops working properly after moderate use,"The leaves appear to be too heavy for the mobile motor.  Have all ready returned the product once, for a replacement in kind, as our baby really seemed to enjoy it and we hoped it was just a fluke.  But it happened again.  Mobile will work properly and rotate for period of time (first one worked for about 2 weeks, second lasted 2 months - moderate use at bedtime) but then the motor bogs down.  Once the leaves are in the down position and the motor starts to fail, the leaves will not return to upward position and the figures do not spin.  If you take the leaves off of the mobile the figures begin to spin again but we purchased this item for its entirety, not just portions of it.  Love the idea behind this item, just wish it could hold up to moderate/average use.  Read other reviews about the same problem before purchasing the mobile, now I wish I listened to them in the first place...I don't hate the mobile but I sure don't like it b/c of the two negative experiences."
Baby,5.0,This is his favorite toy,My baby loves this!  He likes all the different textures and colors and will play for ten minutes at a time (that's forever for a six-month-old) with his dragon.  I often worry about fabric toys' stitching but despite being gnawed on for months it is still sound.
Baby,1.0,What a disapointment,"I purchased this product after comparing it to the mobiles that project onto the wall. I was super excited to get it in the mail but after I put it together and purchased the batteries for this thing, it didn't work right. Only the leaves would move and they did that very poorly. The lights and sound didn't work at all. Also, this mobile is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Once your baby can reach up, that things is coming down!! What a piece of crap. I'm just sending it back for a refund because I don't have the time to wait and mess with the replacement mobile that Amazon will send.<br /><br />Word of advice. Don't buy this mobile, just keep looking!"
Baby,5.0,Great utility,"I pump into Avent bottles at work, so I purchased these for transport. These are very durable and clean easily. When you buy the Avent bottles, these are NOT included. I honestly don't even pop these out before cleaning the screw-on caps that these insert into, because they clean really well as one unit. Once baby no longer feeds from bottles, these discs will be great to transport food when we're on the go or otherwise traveling."
Baby,2.0,Very cute and seemingly practical product but it did not work for us.,"I'm a little jealous that many reviewers say that their kids took to this immediately! not my son. He looked at it with a little bit of interest, put it in his mouth and tossed it on the floor! I tried to leave it his play pen, crib, take it on car rides but he did not show any interest at all and so it went to the 'oh well I tried pile' and that's for that. In all fairness, I would like to add that perhaps it would work if we started our son on this right from the get go instead of introducing it after his regular pacifier because he seems to like one particular brand of pacifiers and the one day I bought a different type that was shaped 'to fit his mouth better' it promptly flew to the floor."
Baby,2.0,Careful!  Mount does not fit some cribs,"Bought one of these a few monthes ago in preparation for baby due this August. . .  The mount did not fit on our crib railing. It seems they did not consider the variety of crib sizes and designs being sold in the US. We bought our crib at Target so it a fairly common crib design.<br /><br />After several e-mail exchanges with the company, they basically said \\""sorry\\"" and suggested I mount it on something else.  Now I find myself in the position of having to find or create something custom to work around this basic design flaw.  Really want to like this product, but it's a bit of a damper when it doesn't 'just work' out of the box. Wish they would have made the mount universal and not just for small-rail-sized-style cribs."
Baby,5.0,Spy Tech.,Nothing to say except that this monitor does it all!!! and even more after you read the instructions :) small and compact but does it all!
Baby,4.0,Great Monitor,"The Smart Baby Monitor by Withings works great. It sets up easily out of the box and the app installs in a flash. I use the monitor to watch over an elderly parent and the video is clear and the night vision works well too. I use the monitor via Wi-Fi and I  have had no problems.  When using the monitor over a cellular network, it needs to allow longer than thirty minutes of use. Overall I am very pleased with this product."
Baby,5.0,Great!,"This organizer works great with my Macleren Volo. It is the perfect size and works well fitting all of my drink needs. A large Nalgene-type water bottle won't fit in the cup holders, but pretty much all my other smaller cups/bottles fit. My only small con is that to close up the stroller, you have to unstrap one side. There is wire inside that helps keep the shape of the organizer, so you have to let it hang from one side when it is collapsed. Not a big deal though."
Baby,5.0,great monitor,"We debated long and hard between the withings smart baby monitor and other highly rated home security baby monitor substitues on Amazon.  We are very happy with our choice.  It was a breeze to set up and works well in our house (~3,000 sq ft).  We are able to access the images from our iphones and ipad simultaneously which makes it very conveniant.  The night vision is clear.  The ability to speak through the iphone, turn on music and lights are an added bonus.  There is a slight lag which is about 2 secs. Not bad.  Priced competitively.  Just slightly more expensive than the top rated radio frequency monitos at BabysRus but totally worth it."
Baby,5.0,my newborn loves this!,"many toys state that they are good for 0-xx months however i have found that very few of them are good for 0-2 months - that is not the case with this one!  in the beginning, my daughter loved the music - very soothing and put her right to sleep.  now she is seven weeks old and out of all of the toys we have, this is the only one that she 'plays' with.  she is captivated by the animals going around.  she swats at them, kicks her legs, shakes her arms, squeals, and smiles.  it's really fun to watch!  and, fortunately, the music still puts her to sleep.  it's perfect for over a changing table or a crib."
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,"I'm not sure why a lot of the other reviewers are having issues, and, contrary to one other review, this device DOES work via 3G cellular network. We've been using the iBaby for about six months now it has never dropped its connection to our home network, and works every time we access it via our iPhones. I'm also not sure why so many people are having issues getting the iBaby set up. It's about as plug and play as you can get and is WAY easier than other devices in this category. The only thing I wish it had was a built-in speaker for 2-way communication. Out the box you can listen to whatever's going on in the room, but you have to purchase an external speaker to communicate back........definitely not a big deal though. Yes, it's expensive but so are other cameras that have as many functions as this does, and this one is optimized for iOS so if you plan on viewing from an iOS device, this is the one to get."
Baby,1.0,Worthless,"Set up is at best difficult even for the technically capable. Once setup, the device looses its connection too frequently to be considered reliable. The alarm that is supposed to activate when the connection is lost is significantly delayed, leaving those of us who rely on sounds from Baby to alert us of an issue unaware for several minutes that Baby is unmonitored.<br /><br />Motion & sound sensitivity settings are too limited, (too much or too little sensitivity) making this feature less than practical. After updating our iPhones & reinstalling the camera & software, the issues we thought we'd overcame continued. Then the App just stopped working all together, with an error message that our phones were no longer connected to the same WiFi they've been connected to for a year without issue. Hmm...<br /><br />I haven't got it in the mail yet, but found another option from (Light In The Box) called Wanscam - Wireless IP Surveillance Camera. With 451 positive reviews it claims to do everything the I Baby Monitor claims plus it allows you to view Baby from any smart phone or computer anywhere in the world. All you need is an internet connection, which removes WiFi limitations. At $46.99 each, it's not a difficult choice. Wish I had found it sooner."
Baby,1.0,"Good idea, poor execution","This baby looks slick but sucks the life out of your battery, has poor picture quality and a pretty significant delay.  Do not waste your $.  Wait for the next version."
Baby,5.0,Superb!,"I've been waiting for this!  I had setup a generic Internet security camera, but it just wasn't the same.  This is SO simple to use and the picture quality is excellent.  Low light could be better, but for our needs it has been perfect.  It will also run in the background so you don't have to constantly have the app in the foreground to monitor your baby.  Just set your iPad / iPhone to the side and you can audibly hear any noises.  You can also set alerts if you're using your phone for other things.  I can not recommend this product enough!"
Baby,2.0,Bad Signal,"I just bought the product because is beautiful and i read its functions and what it did and that convinced me over my other options.<br /><br />But once i installed it, i realized i made a very bad decission. The monitor loses ita signal every time you want to move the camera or put a tune or talk to the baby. And it takes time to reconnect.<br /><br />I have a very fast internet access and i am sure that is not the thing why the monitor disconnects every time."
Baby,5.0,4 years later and we STILL LOVE this mobile!!,"I am so glad I purchased this mobile when I was pregnant. Here we are 4 years later, and we still love it. Once she got old enough to start pulling on the mobile I took that part off and we only use the musical part. The music has become a ritual every night since she was born. If she doesn't fall asleep by the time it shuts off automatically, she asks me to turn it on one more time. She loves it and I say whatever works! There are 3 classical music selections and one selection that sounds like quiet jungle noises (monkey, frogs, crickets chirping). After 4 years of playing this every night at bedtime, changing times when she was a baby, and naptimes, I have only had to change the batteries twice. The batteries have lasted a lot longer now that I took off the mobile attachment which is as expected. This is at the top of my list of worthwhile things I purchased to prepare for my baby."
Baby,5.0,Everything and more,"It's a great product.  So many other baby monitors are just really crappy quality and terrible features for crazy prices.  It's like the wedding effect on venues; as soon as you say \\""baby\\"" webcam prices go through the roof.  Basically, if Apple were to make a baby monitor, this would be it.  From the awesome stylish packaging, to the great user interface and features, superb quality, and convenience all in 1 cute box.  It's perfect for what we need, especially being able to check the monitor from work on my iphone.  It's like I'm working from home and can run up to check on her whenever I want."
Baby,3.0,Wrist rattles,"The wrist rattles are cute and seem to be amusing to the baby, but the rattle is very small so not quite as much fun as I had hoped.  Cute none the less."
Baby,5.0,Easy to keep track of,"Pacifiers tend to disappear. They fall and roll under a couch, get lost, or snatched by aliens (who knows). This one is attached to a toy monkey. It's fun for our daughter to play with and soothing to suck on. It stays put and doesn't get lost. She likes chewing on the tail, the paws, and tag as well. It's great. We have the frog version too. When it gets all slobbery, we just toss it in the laundry."
Baby,5.0,BEST PACIFIER EVER!,"with my first baby, i must have bought 50 pacifiers because we always lost them...these are pretty hard to loose and my second daughter can put them in her mouth easily. the one night i put her to bed with out it, just a normal pacifier, she woke up screaming in the middle of the night because she couldn't find it...never made that mistake again and she hasn't woken up in the middle of the night since.  and i put mine in the dishwasher...sanitizes and cleans perfectly. squeeze out the water, and put in a towel for a little bit and it is dry."
Baby,5.0,Very Cute!,"This toy is really cute! It hangs down about 12 inches from the hook to the bottom of the tail. My daughter is only 6 weeks old but she already loves it. She'll stare at it and even wave her arms around like she wants to touch it, so I'm sure she will appreciate it even more as she grows. The feet and wings are crinkly, the ball has little beads in it, and the tail has a little mirror attached. Love it, wouldn't change a thing about it."
Baby,5.0,ESPECTACULAR,"MI NENA LO ADORA, CASI TODAS LAS NOCHES SE DUERME CON LA MUSICA.<br />SUPER RECOMENDABLE, HERMOSO LOS COLORES QUE TIENE, CALIDAD IMPECABLE."
Baby,5.0,Monitor for yuppies,"Easy to use, easy to set up. I can watch and listen and talk to my baby from anywhere, including work. We have a multitude of Apple devices, so the monitor works with every single one of them via an app. One drawback is that they limit the data transmitted over 3G, so that you'll only be able to see your baby for 5-10 minutes at a time before it stops you. However, if you have Wifi, then you're unlimited. The picture is clear and the sound is as well. Expensive, but alas, worth the cost due to easy setup and easy use.  Recommended."
Baby,5.0,my baby loves it.,"You movement is smooth and quiet. The night light is a bit dim, but it is very good on batteries we have had it for a month now and haven't had to change the batteries we use it a couple of time a day. Our baby is 4 months old and she loves it. She won't sleep in the vein without it. In short the best mobile we have tried we have had three."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic Mobile!,We had purchased a simple (but more expensive) wind-up mobile from the local baby store and the internal winding mechanism broke after about one month. We found this at such a good price and ordered immediately. Our daughter absolutely LOVES watching it! The remote is a nice option to have as well.
Baby,4.0,Nice way to stay connected to my son in the hospital,My eight week old baby has been in the hospital since birth and I miss him terribly when I can't be there. We've set up this monitor in his crib so I can always see him and he can hear my voice anytime. It's wonderful. I have been pleasantly surprised by how receptive his nurses and doctors are to having the video monitor in his crib...they love the idea. I love that I can talk to my baby even when I'm away from him. Great way to stay connected.<br /><br />The only downside is that sometimes the picture freezes or disconnects me...but usually it operates smoothly.
Baby,4.0,I love Apple,Great product but does freeze up sometimes. Love seeing my baby in his crib playing or sleeping and alerts if too loud or too much movement!
Baby,5.0,Wonderful product,My son is 2 years old and he still use this to sleep every night. I would buy this again and again and this is perfect for a rain forest nursery
Baby,5.0,Great purchase!  Love it!,"I received this as a baby shower gift from my aunt and I absolutely love it, as does my husband.  The music isn't loud but it's not supposed to be, it is after all a device to get your baby to go to sleep.  I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews about the sound because that turned out to not be a concern of mine at all.  It is so easy to assemble, took me 5 minutes and it was done.  I love the Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Rainforest sound options - my favorite is definitely the rainforest though, very soothing.  The 'fuzzy' leaves open and close and the leaves with the animals attached spin around slowly.  This will definitely put any baby to sleep, it is so comforting and soothing.  I would give this product 10 stars if possible, I love it.  It also goes perfectly with our jungle theme baby room, it added the final touch to the room and it looks perfect.  I highly recommend this product to any and everyone."
Baby,5.0,Adorable!  Can't wait to give as gift.,I bought this (and a couple of other designs) for my niece that I will be visiting soon.  It is adorable!  I hope she loves the functionality of it as much as I'll love looking at her using it.  I really like the fact that it is machine washable.  I'm going to suggest to the Momma to either keep it in the memory box when the baby outgrows using it.
Baby,5.0,Awesome product,"So completely functional that I moved from baby monitoring to in house monitoring while I'm away. The functionality of the product allows viewing from anywhere in the with quick connections via WiFi. I am able to receive motion detection, temperature drops or rises, humidity detection and sound detection alerts on my iPhone and iPad making this an invaluable tool for monitoring my home while I'm away. I'm sure it would be a fabulous baby monitor as well, but I have found other uses... Want to get one other for the upstairs portion of my home."
Baby,5.0,Good Camera,Good Camera<br />The camera is very excellent for me I've liked .. Thank you<br />I have used in my shop as well as control
Baby,1.0,Motor stopped working after 3 months,"We read the reviews for this product and noticed that some people had listed mechanical problems as one of the primary risks for this product.  We ordered it anyway thinking that many of the reviews did not encounter the problem and that we may therefore be okay.  I can assure you that this problem occurred rather quickly with casual use on our part.  We play it for our 4mo old son before he goes to bed on most nights, but certainly not all.<br /><br />This problem having shown up so quickly with casual use on our part make me suspect that the quality is inferior for the drive mechanism.  The music and speaker portion still work.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of this product is obviously lacking and you should be aware that you are taking a reasonable sized risk when purchasing this product that the drive mechanism will stop working.  You have been warned."
Baby,1.0,Piece of Junk for the Money!,"When you read all of the features this thing has one can only get excited about it.  Buyer beware, this thing is constantly failing.  The video always freezes and half the time the whole connection fails so I can't even hear my daughter.  I even spent the time and money moving my router around in the house so I could hardwire the monitor directly to the Internet.  The connection has gotten a little better but still fails.  I understand that sometimes connections get interrupted the worst part for me is the app has never successfully reconnected on its own.  I can't tell you how many times I have woken up only to find the monitor not actually working.  If the connection is lost the app shouldn't stop until it reconnects and if it goes 5 minutes without being able to reconnect it should alert me saying \\""I am a piece of junk, i lost the connection and can't get it back.  Please quit the app and reconnect.\\"""
Baby,5.0,Great for Stroller,Love this stroller organizer!  Easy to use and fold down flat so you can take it with you when not using.
Baby,5.0,Great gym for babies,I bought this for my daughter when she was a newborn and she loved it when she was able to make the ball play the music.  Now she is 11 months and still plays with it.  Would def recommend.  We also bought the Rainforest Jumperoo to match and it's so cute!
Baby,5.0,Worth it for the price.,"I bought this just from reading the reviews from the BJ Parent console and comparing to this Diono Buggy. I have the BJ City Mini GT. Transitioning from a snap & go with cup holder to nothing blows! So I bought the Diono Buggy and do not regret it. Can hold more than enough for me right now (have a 3 month old) bottle, wristlet, bottle water and the blackberry with room to spare...good to go! Best $10 spent."
Baby,5.0,"My ""Go to"" gift!","With so many people going with the jungle theme for their nurseries, this has become a gift that I give to a lot of new babies!"
Baby,1.0,It's going right in the trash,"This wipe case doesn't stay closed and when it is closed it has a large gap so the wipes dry out very quickly.  The red slider is very difficult to open so you have to brace the case with one hand while using your other hand to slide it.  This is very difficult to do when you're trying to change a wiggly baby. Also, the hinge broke within days after I bought it. This case sucks.  Don't buy it."
Baby,2.0,Great Concept - Horrible delivery,"My husband and I decided to go with this monitor since 1) all of our electronics are apple products.  2) We LOVED the idea of multiple monitors (2 iPhones and an iPad) without ANOTHER gadget to keep up with, especially since we always have our phones with us.  This was probably the deciding factor.  We set up the monitor when it arrived (prior to baby's arrival) and were so excited to use it.  A few other pluses we liked about the monitor:<br />-Ability to start music from iPhone/iPad<br />-Ability to talk to baby<br />-Temperature and Humidity information<br /><br />Unfortunately, when we started using the monitor in real life situations once our baby arrived home we found it less than acceptable.  We are returning the monitor for the following reasons:<br /> - main reason - it looses connection with the internet all the time and often says it can not reconnect<br /> - Range for bluetooth connection is not strong enough for our home, or to take monitors outside on back porch<br /> - Horrible feedback (very shrill) from the listening/audio monitoring<br /><br />For the price, this monitor should work like a DREAM! Extremely disappointed it didn't work, we were so hoping that it would."
Baby,5.0,Great buy,"I purchased this for my City Mini and it works great.  It has two elastic cup holders and a long pocket that fits my keys, wallet, and iPhone.  Don't waste your money on another product, this is sturdy, functional, and economical."
Baby,4.0,Great crib mobile,"My 4 month old boy loves this. It really helps to settle him and will watch it for an hour!<br /><br />I wish it played for longer than 15 minutes but there is a remote to restart it from the doorway.<br /><br />One downside is that I had to oil it! It squeaked SO loudly when turning I had to turn it off. Still, it's fine since I oiled it :)."
Baby,5.0,Great,I have a bumbleride Indie and this organizer works great! I got it a couple months ago and it still looks like new!
Baby,2.0,Withings Smart Baby Monitor,"6/25/2012:<br />My wife and I were very excited to get our Withings Smart baby Monitor for our first child. It has a ton of great features like the temp, humidity, noise/movement graphs and more. Being able to have the monitor viewed on either of our iphones or ipad, was one of the top selling features.  Withings showed a lot of innovative in their design and execution of the Smart Baby Monitor, the price point seemed appropriate<br /><br />I've been using the monitor on my wife and baby while they sleep in the other bed room with a co-sleeper. I am doing this to be sure that the wi-fi and blue-tooth connection wouldn't be interrupted or drop off when we have the baby sleeping alone with just the monitor on him.<br /><br />Several times in the last week the monitor froze when monitoring mom/baby on the iPad (first generation wifi only, with wifi and bluetooth on). It looked like my wife was peacefully sleeping with the baby.  Really it seems that the connection was frozen.  A lot like in Ocean's 11 where they freeze the frame on a security camera while they break into the safe.<br /><br />Having the video and sound available on our iphone and ipad a great feature, but I would rather have a rock solid, uninterruptable connection between the video monitoring station and handheld viewer.<br /><br />This device needs to be 100% reliable in order for it to be useful for monitoring our child's safety.  If the reliability isn't addressed by the time we have the baby sleeping in the crib alone, then we will probably get another monitor.<br /><br />We've been using the monitor for 3 weeks, I will update this review in another 3-4 weeks.<br /><br />10/1/2012<br />We returned the monitor a few weeks after this review and got a Summer Infant Safe and Secure.  We've been very happy with the new monitor, especially since it was half the price of the Withings model.  We sleep so much better knowing that the connection isn't going to drop ever."
Baby,4.0,Price hike!!! Double what I paid only a month ago!,Wow. I like this product (Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Organizer) but I<br />only paid $9.99 a month ago and it has now almost doubled in price! Really<br />sucks because I was going to order another one for the stroller I keep in the garage<br />for walks in our neighborhood but forget it!
Baby,4.0,Bugaboo Donkey Mono,"I love this product. It is very well made and easily fits any size drink in the cup holder. Plus, I think it is great that I can get two cup holders and a compartment for all my \\""junk\\"" at a fraction of the price of Bugaboo's single cup holder. I rated it four stars because it did not fit on my Bugaboo Donkey. The handle is too wide for the straps to reach across and fit properly no matter how much I played with it or adjusted the velcro straps. But then I got the [[ASIN:B00158DS0U Hook 'n' Stroll Stroller Accessory, Black]] to hang my diaper bag on because it was taking up much needed space in my basket. I attached one of the velcro hooks to the strap of the organizer and made it longer! Now it fits perfectly and I am very happy with the way it fits on my handle. I think the only way for this to fit on a Bugaboo Donkey is if you buy the stroller hooks or attach a nice size strip of velcro to make the straps long enough to reach across."
Baby,5.0,Best product of its kind!,One of the best features is the ability to monitor from the iPhone being out of the network. Being at the office for example.
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves This,My 2 month old loves this. She hugs and pats the stuffed animal on it. She also seem to find it easier to keep the pacifier in her mouth as well.
Baby,5.0,Great toy,My daughter is six months old and she absolutely loves this toy. I think it's clever too. It's colorful and makes a different noise then any other toy she has (not a rattle or a bell).
Baby,5.0,Awesome must have,My daughter absolutely hated tummy time until we got this spinner. We bought it used from a woman in a mommy group. My daughter is such an explorer that she really enjoyed playing with all the gadgets on the mat. I highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,It's a love story,"My 3mo son has been in love with Sir Prance A Lot since he first laid eyes on it, a few weeks old.<br /><br />Now that he's strong and agile enough to do so, he'll spend 10-15 minutes sitting peacefully, shaking the toy, licking it, eating the crinkly feet, sucking on the helmet feather. We love this toy!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable,"Wubbanubs are highly necessary for NICU babies. It gives them a distraction, something to play with and snuggle while developing the sucking reflex. Bought this as a gift, but would get this for my next baby if she/he were also in the NICU. Also great for babies once home as a toy, even if they abandon use of the pacifier part."
Baby,5.0,"GREAT, GREAT","I'M SUPER HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. ITS WAY BETTER THAN WHAT ITS DESCRIBE AS . ITS SUPER CUTE, GREAT QUALITY , IT CAME WITH THE PACIFIER IT ARRIVED ON TIME. I WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE SUPER SATISFIED. PERFECT SIZE FOR A BABY."
Baby,5.0,Great!,"Reasonable price, not too ugly logo splashed over the side, two compartments for cups plus a small pocket with a zipper inside. The only thing i wish it has was some kind of cover that you could pull over the top and maybe fasten with a velcro strip on the site. It would be for situations like sudden rain or when you are packing your stroller up let's say in the airport and you have to remove the organizer bag. In the airport i usually put the organizer bag into the stroller storage bag alongside with the stroller itself but it gets rather bumped in there and it's contents all over the place. Otherwise, ten points!"
Baby,4.0,Almost Perfect,"This little organizer is very handy! I bought a lightweight stroller that had no type of drink carrier and so I bought this instead and it's great. It has a zipper where I can stick my keys, ID and money and the bigger space is great for keeping snacks. The cup holders fit snugly and I haven't had a drink spill. The only drawback is that I have to un-attach it every time I close the stroller or it gets bent. On the up side of that drawback is that when I forget the metal that shapes it is easily shaped back into the original shape. We love this little organizer, especially for the price!"
Baby,1.0,Disappointed !!!!,"Mobile stopped turning after 10 minutes!  The music stilled played but the mechanism that turns the mobile would not turn.  Not sure who  was more disappointed baby or parents!  Had to run  out and purchase another mobile. Now trying to figure out how to return<br /><br />Ps. This product was discontinued by Fisher-Price, I guess I know why!"
Baby,5.0,Great for babies of all ages,We bought this when our son was around 4 months old and we were STILL trying to find a paci he liked.  He was losing his paci in the middle of the night and would wake up because of this.  We found the wubbanub and it was an easy fix.  Definitely worth the money.  Around 6 months he stopped using it as he didn't use a paci at night any longer but now at 10 months he likes to sleep on his side and uses his wubbanub again to hold on to and use the paci on it.
Baby,5.0,daughter loves it,"My 3 month old daughter was given the puppy wubbanub as a gift and likes it so much that we decided to get her a second one, for when the first has been cleaned and is drying. Every baby I know with one of these loves it."
Baby,2.0,Very good camera...At first.,"I like having this camera very much. The software is iOS or browser based. The iOS app has improved dramatically over the past few months and is now very solid and responsive. The browser view is functional, but not great.<br /><br />The major downside of this camera for me is that it doesn't support IPv6, although that could probably be corrected with a firmware update.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />When I first purchased this camera I was very pleased with it. We've now had it for almost two years now. Here's what I've learned while using it.<br /><br />* The app is very flakey. Through OS upgrades it had compatibility issues several times and sometimes took a month or more before an update was available that corrected the problem.<br />* The app is prone to crashing<br />* The app controls are difficult to use. Sometimes screen widgets don't respond, sometimes it takes several taps. Sometimes the control's state and visible state get reversed (it will be on when shown as off, and off when shown as on).<br />* The camera is no longer discoverable from the app. I don't know if this is a problem with the app or the camera. I can still use the web view but the app is now useless.<br />* The manufacturer has never provided a firmware update for the camera, so still no IPv6 support.<br /><br />If you have the ability, I highly recommend getting a Raspberry Pi with a camera connector board. It's cheaper, works better and lasts longer. If that's not your thing, I still discourage buying this camera. Look for a better brand, hopefully one that will last longer."
Baby,5.0,This is the best!,My grandson his this toy and it goes everywhere he does!!  He has loved it since he was 3 months old and is 9 months now and never tires of it!  It is durable and will last forever.
Baby,5.0,baby toy,looking for a cute baby shower to infant gift - this is perfect - highly recommend - toy is made well
Baby,5.0,bright star giraffe,My baby has had this giraffe since she was 4 months old. It is still one of her favorite toys now at 8 months. Each leg has something interesting for her. She likes to look at the giraffe and put each leg in her mouth. The head and body are soft and pleasant against her soft tiny hands. It is one of our preferred toys for riding in the car as it will keep her occupied.
Baby,4.0,"Cute rattle, but didn't work as it intended","The design is very cute and colorful, but the wrist bend is a little too small and barely fit my baby's hands. Also the rattle would not stay on wrist when my baby wave her hands. It would work better if it had some elastic material in it. I end up hanging those on the swing for her to look at. She stares at them sometimes, but not too crazy about them."
Baby,5.0,Fits Britax B-Ready Great!,"I just got this on Amazon for 6.99 plus free shipping since I have Amazon Prime and I love it! I have never written a review before, but I thought people would want to know that you don't need to pay $30 for the Britax stroller organizer! As far as I can tell it fits any size cup or bottle (I tried a regular water bottle, a travel coffee cup, and a big slushy cup from the convenience store). There are two cup holders with a space in between perfect to put your cell phone, as well as a little zippered compartment for keys and a credit card/cash. So glad I found this!"
Baby,5.0,"Works great, zero setup issues",The iBaby has been great for me. It was very easy to install and has worked pretty well (see sound problem in next sentence) since I hooked it up. My only initial complaint with the monitor was the poor sound quality; however in the latest update of the iBaby app they changed the way in which sound was transmitted and it has fixed any sound problem I used to have.... It works great around the house or states away. My child's grandparents live states away from me and they can view the monitor on their Iphones perfectly.
Baby,5.0,fun toy for a baby,"My son loves this. Of all the things I have for his bassinet, this is his favorite. He loves to kick the things hanging down and grabs at the red ring all the time. He enjoys seeing himself in the mirror when I point it at him."
Baby,4.0,Works Great but hard to set up!,"I really do love this camera.  For these reasons, I can see my son when in his room at any time I choose just by turning on my iphone, I can talk to him through my iphone to comfort him if I am cooking or just can't get to him at that very moment, and that I can mount this on my wall and through my iphone I can move the camera to view almost any spot in the room.  Now setting this camera up to use while at home I would say was fairly simple.  As far as setting this camera up to use when you are gone so that if you have a babysitter and you want to check on baby while out I have not yet fully figured out.  Through your home wireless this camera works without a glitch I love it.  Luckily for me my son is 4 months and I am not ready to have a babysitter anytime soon.  =)"
Baby,5.0,It helps my little one busy...,This keeps my little one busy during my thirty minute commute.I love that it clips on the car seat handle and the stroller.
Baby,5.0,Can't go out without this!,"This is so useful when I take kids to park, beach or other places with the stroller!! A decent diaper bag and this buggy buddy organizer really make our trip so much easier!! It's very well made with insulated inner design and hard frame. It was very sturdy while pushing the stroller that I didn't spill any drinks in it ever. Get one and you will be glad with it:)"
Baby,1.0,Didn't work,"I was very excited to get this mobile and we were so disappointed when it didn't turn. The music played as advertised but I think the leaves were too heavy for the little battery powered motor. It rotated only until the part where the leaves were supposed to lift up and then it stopped. I would give this 5 stars for color and cuteness, but only 2 for music quality and 0 for the fact that it doesn't work at all.<br /><br />Too bad."
Baby,5.0,awesome and cute,Omg this little monkey is soo cute and my baby loves it not only i dnt lose it but everybody comments on its a toy he can play with but his pacifier as well to fall asleep :) love it
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,I adore this product. I recently picked it up on sale at Babies R Us for the same price as here. It feels very well made. The drink compartments are slightly stretchy and hold just about any size drink. It fits my City Mini perfectly even with my Travel Boppy attached. The zipper compartment is big enough for keys or ID or anything else small like that that you don't want to lose. Really there's nothing else to say about it. It does what you need for a fraction of the price of similar products.
Baby,2.0,Not worth more than $25...,"Pros: The songs are soothing, you can choose a combo of lights/music/both, there is an option for white noise (forest noises), remote control, 2 volume settings<br /><br />Cons: To attach the mobile to the crib, there is a long peg that comes out the back of the music box part and then a plastic washer that is supposed to be screwed onto it. The tension is not enough to hold up the mobile portion-it immediately tipped forward. Rather than return it, we just secured the mobile by tying a strap from the bottom of the mobile pole to the peg. This is a pretty major design flaw, which is why I don't think the full retail price is fair.<br /><br />I was able to buy this on sale for less than $30 and that seemed a fairer price."
Baby,1.0,don't believe all glowing reviews,"the places where you are supposed to put the cups is elastic, and it is annoying<br />to have to stretch the elastic every time you move a cup in and out.<br />also, we bought one of these, and one of the top straps ripped within a month,<br />rendering it useless.  we had to throw it in the garbage."
Baby,1.0,My son crushed his fingers with this thing.,"The first thing you'd think of when making something like this for infants/toddlers would be safety, right? Guess not.<br /><br />We laid this thing on a flat hardwood floor and our son couldn't get traction since the cloth slipped all over the floor. So we moved the thing onto a carpet. One of the first red flags that popped into my head when seeing this thing was that you just lay the spinner on top of the cloth; there's no anchor system for the apparatus like in other explore mat-systems where the hard plastic is anchored under the cloth.<br /><br />Well, the red flag was unfortunately justified. On a flat surface, our 4 month-old son still had the misfortune to tilt his body in a way that lifted the spinner up and it then came down on his fingers. Now, I want you to imagine the entirety of your body weight coming down with hard plastic edges on your fingers. Doesn't sound very forgiving pain-wise, does it? We didn't even know what was going on as we'd never heard him cry or scream like that before.<br /><br />Now we're sitting here with a screaming kid and wondering if we should take him to the doc since he goes back to screaming a minute after waking up.<br /><br />Sad thing is that I think he'd really be into this thing but if you can't bother to engineer a product that's marketed towards developing infants but doesn't prevent something like this happening to an infant, then you get 1 star from me. Yeah, it was also bad luck, but that's what preventative engineering is for."
Baby,1.0,HORRIBLE!!!,If I could I would give this item NO stars. It does absolutely nothing and I wish I would have never purchased it. My son was not impressed with this toy. HORRIBLE!!
Baby,5.0,Great!!!,I bought a small stroller for my three year old to get around the airport easier and found this to go with it. I am happy I purchased this before we went on vacation.  Love the mesh zipper pouch on the inside!
Baby,5.0,Great Toy!,"This is a great toy. My 7 month old baby loves to chew on the dragon's tail. Great colors and perfect to hold babies attention for at least a little bit. I am also a big fan of a dragon, something besides a monkey!"
Baby,3.0,OK Product,"I like the concept of the product. However, the rattle noise it makes is to  low for baby to hear unless its really quiet. Unfortunately, these socks do not have much stretch to them."
Baby,5.0,My son loves this!,So far great purchase. I cannot attest to the durability but everything works just as described. I purchased for 5 week old and he seems to like motion and sounds. Delivered timely and in great shape!
Baby,1.0,Great while it worked,"I love Amazon and Amazon service.  I have only great things to say about Amazon!  Not so great about this product though.<br /><br />Our first mobile worked and our baby loved it.  It really helped to transition her to her crib.  About four weeks after we got it, it stopped working.  The mobile would not rotate.  The music still played and the light worked but not the mobile.  The mobile is the most interesting part for little ones.  We exchanged it through Amazon (I got a replacement the next day) and it worked for a while... about 7 weeks and then it stopped rotating the same way the first one did.  It's out of stock on Amazon so we are receiving a refund instead of an exchange.  I am starting to think most of what Fisher Price makes is cheap junk.  They won't confirm what their products are made out of and everything seems to come from China.  I'll be looking for a better quality crib toy for my little sweetie.  I am just happy I got it on Amazon because if I had gotten it at a local toy store or other big box store, I probably would've lost the receipt by now and wouldn't be able to return it."
Baby,5.0,Great!,"I purchased the Wubbanub pacifier over a month ago and wished I bought it sooner.  I absolutely love this pacifier for three reasons.  First, it stays in his mouth unlike his other pacifier that is not attached to any plush toy so it constantly falls out. The monkey makes it perfect for night time comfort where my husband and I don't have to get up every minute to put back in his mouth and hear him cry.  Second, its the same brand pacifier he is use too.  He was given the \\""soothie\\"" type of pacifier when he was in the NICU and has been using only this brand since then.  Third, its easy to find if it drops or if you have twins like we do and need to easily distinguish whose is whose: my son has the monkey and my daughter the giraffe.  Although their other pacifiers are colored coded I can't tell you how many times my husband and their grandparents mix those up but they haven't with these.  I still haven't put it in the washer, so I can't comment on its true durablity.  But just for these months this pacifier monkey is worth every penny!"
Baby,1.0,Poor quality,"I ordered this toy as a gift for my baby boy... I open it (so I cannot return it) and then I realize the horse \\""Sir Prance A Lot\\""  has a lot of manufacture fails (damage unit). I just could not believe it... It is plenty of loose strings and - the worst part for me and my child safety - the seams of one horse leg was release. I am very disappointed of Lamaze toys. I cancelled an order with other similar items."
Baby,3.0,TOO HARD,PACIFIER ITSELF IS TOO HARD. THE STUFFED ANIMAL THOUGH IS CUTE. MY NEWBORN NEVER LIKED IT. MAYBE HER MOUTH WAS TOO SMALL IDK....but its ª great teether tho.. Soothed her gums while she was cutting teeth
Baby,1.0,"A cute toy, a terrible guitar","I bought this for my three year old niece as an introductory guitar to start getting her familiar with it and see if it even interested her. This is about the cutest guitar I've ever seen. It is sturdy enough for a young child to use and the extra small size makes it really nice for small hands. The frets are much too small for my average sized adult hands, but that is fine because I wanted it to fit hers.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has no value as an actual instrument. If your child just wants to strum some strings to make random noise then they will probably be happy. But as a guitar player myself, the first thing I tried to do was tune this and have it at least sound somewhat decent. Sadly, it simply cannot be tuned. The tuning pegs function in turning but as soon as you find the note you want and let go of the peg it unwinds itself enough that it is way out of key. I could not even get close to a tolerable tuning to play a single simple song that anyone would recognize. The strings are also strange, they have the appearance of bronze but when I tried to tune one up to a higher note it snapped easier than a nylon string. I was able to sort of repair it since the rest of the instrument doesn't actually function so no one will notice but all in all, for such a cute looking instrument it was a big disappointment.<br /><br />If you want a sturdy and cute toy just for fun then this is inexpensive and cute enough and to please any little girl but if you want a guitar with any real musical value, this is not it.<br /><br />**update**<br />Just broke a second string and they are unique to this guitar so I cannot simply replace the string like a normal one. It's headed for the trash, I am afraid."
Baby,5.0,Still carries these around with her at 12 months,"We ordered these at 5 months, and really regretted not getting them earlier. She loved playing with the legs of the ladybug and the antennae of the bee. Our daughter is 12 months old and still loves these. She carries them around with her all over the place. I like that they're small, but too big to choke on. I highly recommend them."
Baby,4.0,Infant loves it but be careful with tags!,I bought this about a month ago. My three month old LOVES the monkey. She grins every time she sees it. It's easy to clean in the clothes washer. It takes a while to dry so I put it in the dryer on no heat or low heat and it was dry in about 30 minutes. We even bought another so we'd always have one clean.<br /><br />The only problem happened last night. Somehow during her nap my daughter managed to pull the two tags off the monkey. My husband found them in her crib next to her. I'm so glad she didn't put them in her mouth and choke! The monkey had a hole in him where the tags were and you could see the stuffing. Luckily we found it quickly and I sewed the hole up so she can still have her monkey. I cut the tags off her other wubbanub to prevent this from happening again. I wish they didn't have tags or they were sewn on better. I didn't see another review saying this had happened to anyone else but I would encourage you to check the stability of the tags often or just cut them off.
Baby,5.0,Fantastic Baby Toy!,"My 5 month-old daughter LOVES this toy.  If you hold it from the ring at the top, it can function like a marionette puppet. We also have the firefly and the peacock, but this one is her favorite.  It's a gorgeous, well-constructed, and stimulating toy."
Baby,1.0,Wipes dry out! Horrible!,I guess probably all wipes cases have this problem so I just use the wipes as they come sealed in their bag.  When I tried to use this case in the car and diaper bag the wipes dried out in 1 day so it is only good if you use the wipes that day and replace with new ones the next.  Especially in the summer when it is hot if you leave them in the car they are wasted in a day!  Maybe this would work in the winter but not where I live!  I don't see the point just bring the whole wipes bag (I use 7th generation or Honest wipes which are less toxic).  So I think this is a waste of money.
Baby,5.0,Great product for it's price,"I bought this for spare console for my city select which also a double stroller. As when 2nd seat was installed, I just able to use 1 child tray for front seat . Thus,  I just put this stroller organizer at side of my stroller. It's fit well and I able to put in my gal milk/water bottle and small toy! And I still can put my boy drink on the child tray and my drink in my bb jogger parent console. Great product and reasonable price!"
Baby,5.0,Great device!!,"I don't know why people put bad feedbacks on this product. I was researching for baby monitors, and I liked this the most. If you are an IOS device owner, you can eliminate few baby gadgets. Some people complain that it doesn't work over 3g or outside of your wifi zone, they didn't set up properly. I can check my baby from my work over my 3g network. AT home, I don't have to carry my cell phone and baby monitor everywhere I go. All I need is my iphone or my ipad. You can even install the pc version of ibaby, and monitor your baby with your PC. This is a great product, I can't live without it. Some people complain that ibaby's tech support is horrible. When I had a problem setting up my ibaby over 3g network, they returned my phone call within few hours after I left message. They were very polite and knew what they are doing. So I want to tell these people leaving bad feedback that they need to follow instruction."
Baby,5.0,Grandparents' dream!!,"How awesome to live 750 miles away, but get to watch my great granddaughter sleep or play in her crib.  With my amazon points, this was competitively priced, but I have seen some models that look the same and are a lot cheaper.  This one works as advertized and I love, love, love it."
Baby,5.0,So cute and easy to find.,"If I had seen this in a store I would have never bought it because at first I thought it was impratical. But after seeing such good reviews and seeing that the price wasnt steep I caved, and I'm so happy I did. Trust me when I say if your child likes the soothies they will ADORE this. My daughter doesnt even use the pacifier half the time and she loves the monkey. She has three of these (we had four but the dog ate one) and we keep one in the main areas of the house and one in the carseat. It is her little travel buddy, SO CUTE"
Baby,5.0,Great little stroller orangizer,"I just used it with my bumbleride indie and it works great.  I did have water bottles so not sure what would happen with cups without lids.  But just made my life so much easier so that I can fit my husband and mine water bottle and my daughters snacks and her hat all into this little orangizer.  I tried it on my MacLaren triumph, it also works.  For the price it is definitely a great buy."
Baby,5.0,Easy Assembly,"This mobile is SUPER easy to assemble.  Have not put batteries in it yet to be able to comment further, but was happy that it was easy to put together."
Baby,3.0,"Needed, but too many","I needed 2 of these for our bottles when going out and taking drinks with us, but unfortunately they only come in packages of 6.<br />We now have 4 too many, that is too bad.<br />Not very nice that the bottles do not come with these sealing discs already inside."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it.,"My son loves this mobile. Loves it. As a newborn, it was the first toy he noticed and enjoyed. Eleven months later he still likes watching it go around; we just keep moving it higher to keep it out of reach. The charming, brightly colored animals actually face the baby below, which is surprisingly rare for a mobile. The music is fine, but can be too loud. Ideally there would be one quieter setting. However, the insect chirping sounds are pleasant and soothing. We use the mobile everyday before naps and bedtime and need to change the batteries about every three months. Also, while the crib attachment is easy to use, it is not adjustable to different sized crib rails."
Baby,5.0,Love it,I never loose this pacifier cause it's attached to an animal. The baby never loses it cause it's tucked into his shirt which also keeps it in his mouth. Great product. Already recommended to everyone!
Baby,5.0,Keeps the baby very entertained,"My son LOVES this mobile.  He'll lay in his crib and coo at this mobile for 10-15 minutes no problem.  It's been very useful for when I have to quickly make and eat lunch while I'm home alone.<br /><br />The leaves that open and close mesmerize my son and he seems to love the brightly-colored rainforest creatures.  The base unit also plays pleasant classical music and has a nice, warm nightlight (both of which don't seem to do anything for my guy, though).  Putting together the mobile wasn't too difficult either, considering that I managed to do it all by myself WHILE carrying my son in a front-load baby carrier.  The base wouldn't screw onto the front or back of my baby's crib (Europa baby Geneva crib), but it's been fine on the side rail, closer to the backside of the crib."
Baby,5.0,Up to... wayy past 5 months :D,"Without a doubt, all the previous reviews are correct.<br />This product lasts forever.<br />I never did have the dragonfly/wasp/whatever that is in the center go up and down.<br /><br />But I have some questions:<br /><br />1. For the life of me, I can't figure out the name of the first mozart song that is played when the blue button is pressed. Any clue? It is my son's favorite also.<br /><br />2. What is the name of the red bird? We keep calling it a toucan.<br /><br />3. Is the center dragonfly/wasp/whatever that is in the center supposed to go up and down? Perhaps I own an older version?"
Baby,4.0,Lego toy,It was a gift for our Grandson per his request. He loves to build with lego's and tells us what he needs.
Baby,5.0,Great for the City Mini,"I have the City Mini and I looked around for a while before getting this holder. I love it!!! It's nice because the drink holders will expand for larger drinks. It holds 2 drinks and I usually put my keys, wallet and cell phone in the center part and there's still room!! When you fold up the City Mini you don't need to take it off the stroller either."
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,Love this mobile! Bought to replace store ones that only wind up and seemed to break constantly. Baby loves and love that it can be a nightlight also.
Baby,5.0,My 8month old baby loves this,My 8 month baby loves his little monkey sometimes he won't fall asleep with out it. He plays with his little tail rubbes it on his face while chewing on it. Works great wish I would of had it sooner.
Baby,5.0,"Great Product, but what's up with the crazy rise in price?!","I love this product and wanted to order another for my City Mini Double, (when I purchased mine about a month ago it was $7.99), all the sudden it's $20.95? NOT cool at all! I won't be buying another at this price. It's a great product, but definitely not worth $20.95! I gave 5 stars only because I love the product."
Baby,2.0,Not for umbrella strollers,"I needed something like this for a chicco umbrella stroller, but after a couple of uses the metal bent from the times the stroller was closed. This is a great item for stroller that are not closed constantly or that are not the umbrella type. This was a waste of money for me and it is now in the trash."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,We all love this! Daughter likes to hold monkey's paw even when not using the soothie.  Friends and family think its such a cute idea.  I was little worried about price but she enjoys it so much! The monkey is well constructed and so soft.
Baby,5.0,Baby adores this,"This is one of the best 12 bucks I have ever spent in my life. My baby simply adores this toy. I never thought he will hang on to any toy for so long. It has been 4 months since I got this my baby is 7 months now and this is still his favorite. The designer of the toy has been so thoughtful of the colors, patterns, fabric material etc so well. My baby has got amused with every little thing dangling from the toy even today. He looks at it as if he is looking at it for the very first time. Love it when I see my baby get amused."
Baby,5.0,Durable and Cute,Lamaze makes quality toys!  This is my third Lamaze toy and I only wish I got them earlier.  I hang it on my boy's car seat and he just loves to play with it.  Those two little plastic rings on the tail are great for him to chew.  When it gets dirty I just threw it in the washing machine with dirty baby clothes.  Easy!
Baby,5.0,Nifty Wipes Dispenser,Adorable baby wipes dispener suitable for any setting & easily accessible to handle your baby's needs. I love it and I would recommend it to any new or seasoned mom! It arrived on schedule and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this vendor!!
Baby,5.0,Works just as described,"I'm not sure what to say to make these exciting but they work just as described. I like to pump into the bottle on the go and making sure my milk doesn't spill out is key. After several attempts to use the nipples and caps, I decided I needed sealing discs. They work great. Make sure you also use all the parts to the cap though or else you will have spilt milk."
Baby,2.0,"Was fine for awhile, but....",After a month it quickly lost its shape and the metal came out of the fabric....at least for me this was not a well made accessory
Baby,5.0,Great for baby!,These are absolutely adorable and useful. They are bigger so they keep the pacifier in babies mouth and also are good for baby to hold. I love these.
Baby,2.0,my baby was frightened of the animals!,"My daughter was 4 months and she found the bug eyed creatures frightening so I put it away hoping she'd grow into it but again at 7 months, she still gets worked up over it.  Why cant they make the animals smile vs. have bugged out eyes!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for an umbrella stroller!,"I bought this to use with my Chicco umbrella stroller for our commute on the metro.  It is just perfect.  Sturdy enough to stand open without collapsing, yet light enough that it doesn't add weight (so no tipping factor).  Holds 2 drinks (my coffee mug, his sippy cup), and has room in the middle for other items and a zippered interior pocket.  Why pay more?  Some are upwards of $20 or $30...no need as far as I can see.  This is plenty big for our snacking/drinking needs!  Excellent quality so far..."
Baby,1.0,Not worth the money,"I thought that the Wubbanub would be more weighted to help in stay in my baby's mouth, kind of like a Beanie Baby. But, it is not weighted at all and didn't do much at all to help the paci stay in my sons mouth. I returned the product."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,"This a great product for baby. It was shipped fast and reasonably priced well. Baby just loved this item. Thanks, Amy"
Baby,1.0,Crap,"This product is straight up awful. It only has about a 50 foot range from the modem which is cool I guess if you live in a one room apartment. If you buy this, I feel sorry for you. #truth"
Baby,4.0,Works great after you know how to use it!,"The one thing that I think that they dont tell you in the instructions is that you have to use the sealing ring that you generally use with the bottle when you use the sealing discs.  I didnt know that at first and spilt some breast milk, thought I was going to die!  But after using the rings how you are supposed to, they work great!"
Baby,1.0,Doesn't Spin!,"This was on our baby registry and we were excited to put it on our baby's crib.  We used it one time after putting the batteries in it (to see how it worked) and when we went to use it a month later with our new baby, it would not spin!  The music works, but the mobile doesn't spin at all.  So upset b/c it's basically junk. :("
Baby,5.0,Perfect Mommy Tote,"I use this on my Quinny stroller because of the fact that it folds up so small as well as having a hinge between the stroller handles.  I simply un-velcro one side and fold up the stroller.  This organizer is durable, roomy and has 2 cup holders as well as a zipper pouch inside for valuables.  My issue with the stroller (no storage or cup holder) was easily resolved with this purchase.  The Velcro straps are secure while holding a wallet, phone, keys and two drinks ~ I never thought twice about it undoing and spilling my items.  Plus, it's machine washable.  You won't be disappointed in this product!!!!!!"
Baby,4.0,Cute toy,"After reading such great reviews, I ordered this toy for my 6 month old son.  He initially played with it quite a bit, although mostly chewing on the rings.  After a week, he still plays with it, but not any more than his other toys.  I have to admit, I was hoping he would play with this a lot more.  It's still a nice toy though, very bright colors, and the perfect size for little hands."
Baby,4.0,"Great product, a few things could be improved","The best aspect of this product is the natural sounds that lull baby to sleep. The music option is bad, like many baby toys, phony tone and annoying. The leaves that open an close while the animals rotate are very cool. The light on the base is alright, nothing special."
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it.,"My baby loves his monkey soothie! Even when he is not sucking on the soothie he likes to hold on to the monkey. He is only 2 months old, so he doesn't have very good hand coordination yet. When a regular soothie is in his mouth it is harder for him to keep it in. But with this soothie he can hold on to the monkey and the soothie stays in his mouth longer which makes him happy.<br /><br />If the monkey needs to be washed I just pop the whole thing into the washer and then air dry it. Then I clean the soothie part with hot water or a pacifier wipe and it is ready to go for him. It is our go to soothie when he is cranky."
Baby,5.0,"Can't think of anything my kid loves more... nope, nothing","We got this for our boy at birth, and within a few weeks, he could hug it to himself.  So, it was about 50 times less often that we'd have to reach over and adjust his pacifier.  The beads inside help to keep Wubba on our son's chest, even when he was very little, further reducing the amount of retrieval we had to do.  That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.  I LOVE this product so much I got the Giraffe to leave at the in-laws."
Baby,5.0,Great item with Peg Perego Pilko,For those you looking for a cup holder this works great. We have the Peg Perego Pilko Switch and it fit really well. We have it for going to Disneyland and have no trouble fitting the cups in here and you don't have to worry about taking it off to fold the stroller. We did just get it but it seems sturdy and like it will last.
Baby,1.0,"Not yet ready for prime time! Not user-friendly, a lot of quirks. Do not buy.","We really wanted to love this monitor. It actually came recommended by some close friends and was high on our wish list of \\""nice-to-have\\"" baby gadgets. So we decided to \\""splurge\\"" on this monitor. The concept--using your smart phone/tablet to view your baby from anywhere you can get wifi--is spot-on and likely to be a big money maker for someone but this is not the product that will corner this market. The camera itself seems to be high quality and well built but it's all the software quirks that make this product pretty much useless. For starters, the App for iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod) that is required to use, view, control and setup the camera is clunky and far from user-friendly. I am in the marketing field and have seen my fair share of ugly/unusable apps but this one takes the cake. It almost feels unfinished--but in a state that should never have been released to the public, certainly no \\""working beta\\"" version since it barely works.<br /><br />Here are the issues with the app:<br />1. User interface is unappealing and clunky (like it was created in a very foreign language and *poorly* translated)<br />2. Difficult to locate settings and features--what should be straightforward is hidden in sub-menus, etc.<br />3. The software lags a LOT. And by lag I mean the time it takes for you to see/hear on your device what is caught on camera as well as the time it takes for your movement command to control the camera. On average we experienced a lag of 30+ secs but at times as much as 1 minute. Example: I set the alert feature to alert us when there was movement or sound in the room but even after jumping up and down, clapping and screaming in the room, the alert didn't hit my phone for at least a minute. In fact I had given up on it working and was in another room when it finally went off. This is a huge deal to me, I mean what is the good of a monitor if it doesn't monitor in real-time? For the rest of the functions (moving the camera, watching video) the lag was super annoying.<br />4. Hard (if not impossible--I didn't get it to work) to set up camera/wifi/router to allow camera to be viewed and controlled outside the home. Half the reason we got this was to be able to look in on our baby when my wife or I traveled. Setting up your network to allow this is not easy.<br /><br />Issues with the camera:<br />1. The camera has limited tilt. It was impossible to look down enough to get a good view into the crib<br />2. No speaker on camera unit. This means you have to attach your own external speaker to enable two-way audio. This is a very inelegant solution if you ask me.<br /><br />Due to our disappointment with this product we ended up returning to Amazon within a week or two and thankfully we received a full refund. We ended up buying a simple audio monitor made by VTech for $100+ less and love it. Here it is: [[ASIN:B007NG5UF4 VTech Communications Safe & Sound Digital Audio Monitor]]<br /><br />It just works--which cannot be said for the iBaby Monitor."
Baby,5.0,great product!,"Works really well with our city mini gt. Folds up right along with it. Lifesaver bc the city mini doesn't have any place to set things. Holds drinks, keys and my wallet with room to spare!"
Baby,4.0,Does the job,"I bought this organizer to be used on my Britax B Ready stroller. It installs on the handle just fine, but takes a little finagling to get it in the right spot, where you can put a cup in it and not have it bump into the handle. I like that it has two \\""pockets\\"" on the sides to hold drinks securely. It also has a small zippered pocket that can be used for a small wallet, money, or an ID. The main pocket is deep and can hold everything I need to have at hand, and then some. I can still fold my stroller without any problems."
Baby,5.0,Great gift,"I bought one of these after several pacifier clips and this was hands-down the best option. My son loves to cuddle with his wubbanub while he takes his bottle, often placing it over his eyes as he falls asleep (he is now 10 months.) I think it'll be nice when we take away the paci too as he will still have the stuffed animal to cuddle with (after clipping off the paci.) We now have 4 different wubbanubs and love them all."
Baby,5.0,Great organizer,"I purchased this for my Baby Jogger City Mini GT. It fits well and could clearly fit any number of strollers. The backside is black which is what I have facing out so I don't see the red logo. Great purchase, has a nice frame to keep it structured. Much cheaper than the brand one and I like that it isn't too bulky to obstruct my stroller's fold."
Baby,1.0,I baby m3 baby monitor,"I bought thi iBaby M3 iBabr product about few week an not happy with at all.<br />The picture is not so good and you can not zoom in to see.<br />It does not have wire build in. I would not recommend this product to a friend. After I bought this product, I saw one webcam that have wire-fi build in an zoom. It also compatible wit iPhone and iPad. It is at office Depot."
Baby,3.0,Don't like the leaves,"The only problem I am having is with the leaves when they go down they are slow to come back up, and sometimes stop completely. Other wise my 4 month old loves the light and music on it when going to sleep."
Baby,4.0,"Nice caddy for City Mini GT - wish there was more ""hidden"" privacy storage space","Very solid product for the price and I'm happy with it...<br />- Fits the City Mini GT stroller nicely<br />- Durable material - not flimsy<br />- Great price at <$10<br /><br />Only downside is I wish it had hidden storage space for valuables. There's one small zipper compartment on the inside of the middle open pocket. However, the pocket for this zippered space is mesh, so you can see the contents from the outside that're zipped up if you look closely. I keep my iPhone and car / house keys in this zippered area, but there's little room for anything else (I don't think my wallet would fit in there too, so if I'm going for a long walk and don't want to bring diaper bag, I just bring my ID and small amount of cash). All other pockets are completely open / exposed (2 pockets on the outside fit cups nicely, and the middle pocket is larger which is nice to grab things quickly, like wipes / snack / small toy."
Baby,5.0,"Baby's first ""lovey""",My daughter just loved this and it became the first toy she actually wanted to play with as Infant. It's very soft and durable. Perfect size to throw in the diaper bag.
Baby,5.0,Great Device!,After trying many different models of many different baby monitors this thing actually work! The set up was very easy and had no glitches.  If you have an iDevice and you need a baby monitor this is the way to go!  Don't waste your time or money with anything less.<br /><br />UPDATE 2:21AM<br /><br />Just had a fussy little baby that was zapped by the white noise and rainbow night light on this thing.  LOVE IT.
Baby,5.0,quite happy,We are very happy with our new little monkey paccie! It's just as pictured and we have used these products before. Easily washable and easy to find if dropped.
Baby,1.0,Very unfortunate,"We bought this product as my husband was traveling quite a lot for his job.  Since we are first time parents, we were very hopeful this monitor would allow him to see our son from wherever he was located.  Unfortunately, the connection would lose signal for him, but even worse, the same would happen to me at home in the same location! We read the reviews but wanted to hope for the best. No matter what the price is (although I believe it's high), bottom line is it isn't worth it, which is too bad."
Baby,1.0,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Tried it out on iPhone 4s,  Iphone 4, Ipad, Ipad2 and in every case although it would connect to the baby monitor, the app would not get past creating a profile for my child.  I went to customer support and there is no telephone number. See for yourself.  [...]contact I challenge you to find a number to call.  It was a big waste of time."
Baby,5.0,Baby pleaser,Baby boy loves the Soothie pacifier.  The plush toy makes it easy to prop up on the baby so the pacifier stays in place.  Also helps me keep it from hitting the ground when moving him around.
Baby,4.0,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I'm using this with a Baby Jogger City Mini GT. It fits better when the handle is in the lower position (the higher one makes it sit at a slight angle). I had a water bottle, my phone and keys in it. There was room for another drink/bottle and possibly a snack cup. I like having my drink right at the handle instead of in the mesh pockets at the back of the stroller. It's a little flimsy, but I didn't have to take it off to fold the stroller. I wouldn't put a hot beverage in the cup holder part, but I think that's probably true of any parent tray. For the price, I think it's a good product and it does what I need it to do."
Baby,5.0,very good,Very good. comfortable. Do not be misled allows some things. Although proof should babysitter do as a neglect what misguidance. The package should come some more.
Baby,5.0,Love 'em,Love these little baby rattles. It is so fun to watch as child learns that the noise he heres is from his movement. Love it!
Baby,5.0,Love 'em,Love this little foot finders. It seems cool when child reaches for the high contrast colors he actually can feel his own toes.
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT!!!,"Super cute, not too big, not too small.  Wasn't sure what size to expect when I ordered it, I didn't read the fine print, but this is just the right size for a little one that can start to hold things.  Has the noisy tissue inside the wings, an attached rattle, can be attached to a crib, car seat, etc.  Very nice colors and seems to be me made of high quality material.  I bought this for my not yet born baby girl, it was too cute to pass up....this being the year of the dragon.  She won't get to play with it for some time, but having had other kids, I can safely bet this will be a favorite."
Baby,5.0,Excellent for baby,"Our grandson is not even a month old and he reacts to this mobile already! It is by far the nicest one I found after much research. Much larger components than others so baby can see the figures move. Music is great, too."
Baby,5.0,Stroller Organizer,fits very well on my big stroller love the two drink holders and the viper part. i also use it on my elliptical it works so well on both love it.
Baby,4.0,Does the job at a great price!,"Bought this one mainly for my new Joovy Caboose stoller. Who would have thought that a $125 stroller didn't come with an organizer!  Fits well but only complaint is after 2 days of use, the stitches are coming off. It's not falling apart but found some threads coming loose. Maybe a got a bad one, who knows."
Baby,5.0,Love this stroller organizer,"I needed a stroller organizer (and really, drink holder) for a stroller that came without a parent tray and this totally fits the bill.  It attaches with velcro securely to the handlebar portion.  It is designed to hang from the bar, so consider that when ordering.  We have used it on a Joovy Caboose, a Britax B-agile, and a jogging stroller and it fit all perfectly.  I have many times put two 32-ounce drinks in it with no problem whatsoever.  It also has a nice, but small, zippered pocked inside for keys or other items you can't afford to lose (like that extra binky!)  It has a surprising amount of room inside and since it's black, doesn't stand out from the stroller at all.  I have been able to wash it in the washing machine as well.  For what it is, I really have no complaints whatsoever and would totally buy it again!"
Baby,5.0,Great product,"Our son loves his rainforest mobile. It was very easy to put together from the box and install in the crib. I really like how it spins and then slightly pauses while spinning. This makes the rainforest creatures wiggle more than just spinning and gets our sons attention again if he was partially looking away. I also like the remote so if our son is still awake after it stops you do not have to go into the room to the crib, where he can see you, to turn it back on again. Highly recommend this product!"
Baby,1.0,AWFUL,"Do not waste your money on this product. Just about everything doesn't work. The software has a ton of bugs. The customer service is only open during certain hours. You have to leave a message and then they will call you back days later. When you finally do get them on the phone their answers help for about one day before the problem either repeats itself or something else goes wrong. I still have tons of trouble with the alarm going off because it says the camera is disconnected. But the camera is not disconnected...so I reset everything, re-enter all passwords and other bs that is a complete headache.<br />AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!"
Baby,5.0,Cute and fun!,"Both of my boys have used this playmat and have loved it!  I prefer it to the larger ones simply for that fact that it fulfills its purpose without taking up too much space.  Both of my kids have loved the detachable parrot.  I love that two of the toys can be moved to different locations.  The head support doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose once baby can move around.  It has kept both of my children entertained and held up extremely well.  I have washed the playmat, and removable toys many times, and they still look brand new."
Baby,1.0,Motor broke within weeks,"I tend to think negative reviewers come from negative people, but this product really is shoddy. It looks great and operated beautifully for 3 weeks before the motor stopped working (i.e. the leaves stopped rotating and opening/closing; the music and light still work though). I threw out two sets of batteries assuming that was the problem.<br /><br />Choose a different mobile because chances are you won't have time to deal with the warranty or get a replacement mobile once your baby arrives... I wish I had heeded that advice from other reviewers."
Baby,5.0,Great product for my Uppa VIsta,"Easy to use, accomodates all my \\""mess\\"" and more and it fots perfect in the Uppa Baby Vista stroller. and the price...great!!!!! Love it!!!"
Baby,5.0,Fabulous!,This is fabulous for those of us who do not have a tray on our stroller.  Works great and is a good size.
Baby,5.0,Great for Britax B Agile,"This product was great for my britax be agile stroller.  This is more than a cup holder, which is just perfect.  I can go for a quick walk or errand without bringing the entire diaper bag.  The width is great for my stroller.  The little zipper pocket holds my keys.  I love this, wish I got it months ago!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent toy for babies,"I had this mobile on our crib from the day my son was born. He has loved it since then. the colorful animals moving back and forth thru the leaves, the music, the light that comes on, absolutely favorite. I've since given it to my sister-in-law who just had a baby, so that she and her son can enjoy it as well."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"Love this. It matches everything, super soft, holds up well after many washes (machine wash cold, air dry). Baby loves it especially when going to sleep. Baby is 9 months but when she was a newborn it was great because it was easy to find and stayed in her mouth well. I also have 2 pink princess ones and they both are falling apart:( Definitely recommend the monkey."
Baby,5.0,Good for the City Mini,"I thought the parent console sold by Baby Jogger was overpriced, and so I selected this organizer. The price is reasonable, the cup holders are a good size, and the console fits our City Mini stroller nicely (hard to tell it wasn't made for it). Even better, it doesn't need to be removed when folding the stroller!"
Baby,3.0,"Great Camera, Software is OK . . .","UPDATE #2:  Another software update has improved the two way voice. Not perfect, but getting better.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Latest software update has fixed most of the problems with the app (still some issues with two way voice).  Still not five star, but a good product as long as they keep the software working.  Also, after my initial support email response, I got another email from an executive with the company apologizing for the issues and promising a resolution soon. She also followed up with me numerous times, including making sure the new update solved my problems.<br /><br />While I know this is technically a review of the camera, the camera is useless without the software, and the software is absolutely terrible.  The camera is excellent.  The quality of the picture is excellent.  The software is, quite simply, awful.  With the latest release of the iOS (iPhone/iPad) software, the app either shuts down or freezes within a few seconds.  I am not to the point where I know I cannot trust it at all without completely shutting it down and restarting it.  The two way voice is really a crap shoot.  Works sometimes, others all you can hear is feedback.  I bought this product after reading some of the same reviews about the software.  I was hoping they were wrong; they were not.  I contacted their support group via email and all I got was a standard \\""thanks for your time, our technicians are working on it.\\""  Although the ability to move the camera with your phone is nice, I really wish I had spent the extra $100 for the Withings product.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product until they fix the software."
Baby,5.0,Perfect air tight seal!,"These sealing discs are great for traveling. They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.<br /><br />You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.<br /><br />This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price. It's great for parents who are on the go and are looking to store baby bottles more efficently."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,"Because this is one of those \\""universal\\"" type items that supposedly fits every stroller, I anticipated it working but not being great. I was wrong. We have the Aprica Presto Flat stroller [[ASIN:B004MDLBBS Aprica Presto Flat Stroller, Premiere Red]], and the fit is PERFECT."
Baby,1.0,Big waste of money,"We had high hopes for this product.  We purchased it before baby came and it seemed to work fine at the beginning, but gradually started having issues connecting.  Baby is now 3 months old and just when we switched baby to sleep in his own room, no joke, monitor just stopped working!  The baby's room is not very close to our bedroom so there was no way we were going to have him sleep in his room without a monitor.  I ended up running out to Walmart and purchasing a Summer Infant and am very pleased with it.  It's so much easier to use.  It was a breath of fresh air to have a monitor that didn't involve technology (iphones, ipad, etc.).  I would wait till the next generation of those monitors to come out before trying something like this again."
Baby,2.0,Worked great for 3 months...and then ripped!!,"I ordered this to use with my Britax B-Agile stroller.  I Velcroed it on a few months ago and I've never had to touch it again.  It is discreet and sleek and folds right along with the stroller.  This is great for drinks, keys, my iPhone etc.<br /><br />Update...after a few months of use the strap on this organizer just ripped right off!  It is useless and now I am going to spend the money on the Britax one I should have gotten from the start.  I suppose it is partially my fault for going the cheap route and getting the knockoff basket but the Britax one is a lot nicer.  I really wish Britax supplied it with the stroller but i wish more that I didn't choose to buy the cheap one first...ugh..."
Baby,1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"We are sooo disappointed and upset.  As a child, I grew up with Fisher Price.  In fact, as an artist, I have even incorporated the classical toys in my Motel Series paintings; however, their quality has gone to the toilet.  :(<br /><br />We purchased this mobil for our baby as she has had sever acid reflux and we were hoping it would help soothe her.  It DID!  She LOVED to watch the animals go round and round in the little increments of time that allowed her to be at her 30 degree recline... This all lasted less than a MONTH!  :(  :(<br /><br />Not only are we angry about the consumer \\""rip off\\"" we are also VERY angry about the WASTE that will go to the landfills.  SHAME ON FISHER PRICE for making such a crappy, throw away product."
Baby,5.0,Love it! A must have!,"I was not sure if my baby needed more stimulation especially while sleeping when I purchased this mobile. Thank goodness I did! The soothing nature or classical music is not cheap sounding. The animals are soft and engaging for baby to watch. Nightlight is available if you choose. I found that the combination of the quiet music and gentle animal movement is a great que for bedtime. Sometimes she just watches the animals quietly until she falls asleep. The mobile function did stop working, frustration gallor. However, with one quick request from amazon we had our replacement the NEXT DAY! She is 9 months and still enjoying this mobile as are her parents! =)"
Baby,3.0,you need two,"So I thought this would be my saving grace to not have to endlessly go in and constantly reinsert the pacifier. It helped a little, but only when I propped it up with another wubbanub pacifier."
Baby,5.0,My baby girl LOVES this mobile,"I got this based on really good reviews that I saw on this site.  At the time, they were offering it cheaper elsewhere, so I bought it from the local big name mass marketer. I am so without any disappointment whatsoever!! My fiancee was able to put it up with seemingly little to no difficulty.  The batteries seem to be holding out fine so far but we've only had it for a month or so.  My almost 2 month old is in love with the animals and the motion of this mobile. I'm in love with the music.  She's in there as we speaking \\""talking\\"" and cooing at the animals and it's just the cutest thing ever.  The music is soothing and the motion is smooth and flawless.  The leaves move counter up and down and around each other.  I'm really hoping this holds out for the long haul.  I really like the fact that the night light can still be used even after baby outgrows the mobile function.  The nightlight is very faint, however and cannot be considered a real night light, but she does seem to stare at it as if transfixed and it's quite cute.<br /><br />**** Update **** Four months later, the mobile is still going strong and she seems to still be enjoying it.  She is hilarious conversating with Mr. Monk, Ms. Ladybird, Mr. Gecko, etc.  We recently had to replace the batteries, but we used the thing quite a bit so 4 months of use seems ok for how much we would let it run."
Baby,1.0,Does not work reliably!,"The camera looks good and has tons of good functionality.  HOWEVER, the main functionality - remote connection to the mobile app for remote monitoring - does not work reliably!  The mobile app keeps losing connection to the camera and the camera has to be restarted manually at least once a day.<br /><br />Without remote monitoring, this is a very beautiful lullaby player and thermometer - things I would not pay $300 for :)<br /><br />Costumer service for Withings is non-existent, which is unacceptable for such an expensive product."
Baby,5.0,A big hit!,"Our son loves this little dragon. As he was born in the Year of the Dragon, it is one of his many dragon-themed toys, but this one is a favorite. The textures are myriad and engaging...soft, plush body, corduroy belly, mirrored tail, rattle in one hand and colorful flower in the other and crinkly wings. I was a little worried about the ribbon pieces coming off and presenting a potential choking hazard but this is not the case. Construction is solid. Highly recommended for all little dragons out there."
Baby,3.0,Has issues,"The idea behind this is great. It's nice not to have a seperate monitor to pack around. However, it stopped working when the new iOS 6 came out & it took too long to get an update. Finally got that, but now I can't take pics. It says its taken a pic & saved it to my photos, but they are not there. It also closes out other apps that I'm in when the ibaby is running. Gets annoying! It says it will work as long as you're in a wireless network, but that's not true. I have been on many wifi networks & it wouldn't work. So far I have only found one outside of my home that it will work on. The clarity of the picture is very good & it's easy to move the camera around. The camera is very quiet too so moving it around won't disturb your child."
Baby,1.0,Not impressed and doesnt really work,I have enjoyed other skip hop products but this does not seem to keep the wipes moist they dry out. I got this holder for my car in case of a quick diaper change and was dissapointent more than once. If it did not have the easy red slide tab I would have had moist wipes.
Baby,5.0,loves his Wubba,As a newborn he could only use a Soothie preemie paci because his mouth was small even though he was full term. By 4 & 1/2 months he needed to move to a newborn size so we decided to try a Wubbanub. He adores his monkey Wubba and it fits him way better now that he is a bigger guy. :) And best of all it is easy to find and doesn't bounce and roll when he drops it :)
Baby,5.0,sealing discs,"These made my newborn kit complete. Great for storage, no leaks. You can also write the date on them. Easy to use."
Baby,5.0,love it!,"i ordered this product on tuesday night and recieved it thursday morning! super fast shipping! after spending lots of time browsing the different organizers/cupholders i chose this one. and i love it. it fits perfectly on my Peg Perego Pliko, and putting it on and taking it off is simple. big enough to hold a bottle for me, a sippy cup for her, my keys, wallet, cell phone, whatever else mom decides to cram in there. very nice product for the $15 i paid including shipping. i would recommend this product!"
Baby,1.0,Broken after a day of use,"Day 1: Assembled it. Had it up and running, playing music, spinning. The baby just loved it.<br />Day 2: Turned it on and it would not spin. It just made some clicking sounds and played music. Filled out an Amazon request to return due to defect.<br />Day 3: UPS picked it up for return to Amazon.<br /><br />Based on the number of negative reviews if you buy this product your just gambling if you need to return it or not. I would recommend keeping the box for a few days that way if you run into the same problem the return process isn't that difficult. If it breaks outside the return window you are out of luck however so you may want to consider that when making your purchase."
Baby,5.0,cool,"very useful product. My baby feels good drinking in this bottle. I really like AVENT line, it's easy to clean and to have in good conditions"
Baby,1.0,Worst baby monitor,This is by far the worst monitor to spend so much money on. It never connects and whatever they advertise on their website is total nonsense. The worst of all is their customer service. If something ever goes wrong only god can help you.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
Baby,5.0,Just what was needed,"You'd think for how much I paid for my Uppa Baby Vista something this simple and ingenious would have come with it. Regardless, I love this. Perfect for my cell phone, keys and a coffee."
Baby,5.0,Best pacifier,My daughter told me my grand baby loves this. I never heard of them until my daughter said this is what baby Mia loves. I think this a cool idea and it gives the baby something easy to grasp on to.  This is my first grand child and I like to spoil that's what grand dads are for.
Baby,5.0,Lots of entertainment for baby,"This toy is a must, provides lots of entertainment for a baby. It is hard for a baby to reach, so I would hand it to the baby while in the car seat or having tummy time. My child likes this so much, I purchased two so we could make sure they we always have one with us. Several different textures are present on the toy to entertain the child. This toy has also been washed several times and has held up well."
Baby,5.0,good seal discs,no leak. it is very good  seal discs for stroage milk for baby.easy to clean and safe I love it all. Thank you
Baby,1.0,Dont waste your money,drops the connection on your iphone after only a few moments even though it has a full strength wifi signal.  It completely contradicts the whole point of having a baby monitor.  It was very frustrating to spend so much money on this product which you can not even trust is updating a current image of your baby.<br />complete waste of money....$20 monitor from walmart does a better job.
Baby,5.0,super cute,my baby loves the colors and how it rattles...this is a must have for baby learning about hands and feet.
Baby,5.0,fun for baby,My 3 month old boy loves this toy. It is perfect for little swing or for car seat. Also can use with pram. Very happy with this product.
Baby,1.0,Falls out of mouth AND unhygienic cleaning process,"I bought these ones with a toy hoping they would stay in the baby's mouth as he sucks on it. Unfortunately, it's no good. The toy is surprisingly small and light. It does NOT anchor the pacifier gently near the baby's mouth. This makes them just as good as standalone pacifiers because both will fall pretty quickly (unless your baby is always zen'd out!).<br /><br />The second and bigger \\""no-go\\"" concern is that the pacifier is STITCHED to the toy! For something that's to be washed pretty often (the pacifier), how the heck are you to wash it with the stuffed toy ALWAYS attached to it? Washing stuffed toys increases the chance that insufficient drying will cause mold. Do you really want mold 1/4 inch away from your baby's mouth? To avoid that you can sun dry the stuffed toy (heat and direct sunlight sanitize it). But doing so will ruin the silicone part - the pacifier.<br /><br />So if it doesn't help keep the pacifier in place AND runs a very high risk of mold - why in the world would anyone buy this product? Better to use to a standard pacifier ..."
Baby,3.0,Was disapointed,"I was disappointed by quite difficult opening and the fact, that the box does not prevent drying out the wipes - it does not seal."
Baby,5.0,so cute,I love this little monkey! The passy atually come with it and it is permantly attached! my son lov monkeys they are his favorite!!!
Baby,1.0,Too expensive for a product that is over hyped.,These really dont do anything special. I cant find a use for them. The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money. Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products. There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price
Baby,5.0,Review,This is great for a great price.  Really questioned if should spend the extra money and getting the official Baby Jogger bag and SO glad I didn't.  I love the one large compartment and it is so easy to attach.  Really good item for the price!
Baby,1.0,Doesn't stay closed,"The side closure doesn't work, so the dispenser pops open even without any wipes in it, I am better off with the cheap one that came with my portable changing pad."
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT,"I love all the Lazaze toys for babies and this one is as cute as they come.  My grandbaby loves all the little tags around the head and there are plenty of teething rings for him to chew on.  It also fits really nicely over the handle of his carrier, stroller, car- seat.  I love this lion."
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT,"Once more, a terrific product from Lazame.  Their baby toys are so colorful and fun for little ones.  They fit to well over the handles of car seats, strollers, carriers.  This one has lots of chewies on the tail and the 'knight' is in a perfect place for a young baby to grab easily.  The feet make crinkly noises which my grandbaby loves and the tags on the saddle entertain him for ages."
Baby,5.0,"Great for teething, when they are finding hands","I've had these for my now 5 month old for a couple of months and we have been happy with them.  We started with them when she was about 3 months old and just starting to find her hands and she was fascinated by the colors and noise.  As she started teething, she loves to suck and gnaw on them (it sounds pretty funny, actually) and I love that I can just throw them in the wash, though I do use a delicates bag and air dry to minimize wear on them.  Unlike a couple other reviewers, I have had no trouble with getting them on my daughter or having them stay on and shes been running about 50% on the growth charts.  Maybe if your little one has large wrists? Anyway, I think they have been money well spent!"
Baby,5.0,Great Organizer,Great stroller organizer that fit my city mini perfectly and I didn't have to spend $30.00 on the baby jogger brand!
Baby,5.0,Great toy,"This is adorable, it seems well made, and it attracted the attention of my four-month-old immediately! It's the current favorite."
Baby,3.0,horrible noise,"I love the concept of this mobile. However, from day two mine has made a horrible noise when the gears are opening and closing the leaves. I seem to be getting bad luck with Fisher-Price lately because I also ordered a play gym around the same time that ligths up and plays music by Fisher-Price that only worked for about a month.<br /><br />I'd probably give 5 stars if I didn't get a lemon."
Baby,2.0,Just a toy,"Was really excited when I got it as a gift, particularly as it is so much simpler to set up than most other video ip  systems. But A) the quality of the link is very unstable. It frequently cut out, meaning too often I only learned my baby was unsettled because I could hear her shrieking through the door. And worse B) the quality of the construction is shoddy. Four month after I received it, it stopped working. Good luck trying to get the attention on the company."
Baby,1.0,Worst ever- waste of time & $$,"I ordered one from amazon - the product would not register my wifi. I am very tech savy and could not get this thing to work, I even called the company- they were no help, just told me to return it. So I returned it to amazon for another one (the company told me I just had a \\""bad\\""one). Same exact thing happened with the second one- it was such a huge pain. Lots of time and money lost. Amazon charged a restocking fee- terrible.<br />I usually don't write reviews- but this really is a bad product."
Baby,4.0,"Cute, but...","The toy is adorable, and very soft. It is easy for baby to grab and manipulate. The major problem is that the Soothie that is attached to it is the 0-3 month size, and I cannot find them anywhere in a size bigger. As my son just hit the 3 Month mark, I will be forced to upgrade to the 3-6 month Soothie and take away the monkey that he has grown accustomed to. And that might make things very difficult."
Baby,1.0,SAD PURCHASE,"Actually I had very high expectations from AMAZON, and I really thought they take care of the products ordered. I ordered 4 IBABY cameras, they arrived on time, but when I set them up, what a surprise!!! three out of four cameras did not work!!!!!<br />It is very sad, I had the impression that a company like AMAZON.com would check and verify that the products they sale as new actually work.........<br />so, in summary.....bad experience......so, now you know, buy it at your own risk......"
Baby,5.0,Buggy Buddy,I gave my niece a baby shower and she loved the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy since she had the Bassinet Rain Cover and the stroller.
Baby,4.0,Very happy with my purchase,I recently purchased this very colorful  mobile and my little one enjoys the sights and sounds. Love the fact that the mobile can become a music box when he gets older.
Baby,1.0,Unbelievably bad product,"Please -- do not get caught up in the hype: the fact that it is iOS compatible or that Apple carries this device in their stores. For the life of me I cannot imagine why. This is, stated as objectively as I possibly could, the worst electronic device I have ever used. The image freezes, the camera resets. I have attempted to contact their customer service. The quality of the service reflects that of the product *and* the manuals that come with it.<br /><br />In short, this is the least Apple-like device (so we are led to believe) that I have ever used. We are returning this item and going with something from Buy Buy Baby.<br /><br />So, bye bye, iBaby. May we be happier in your absence (and trust what we actually see on the screen!)"
Baby,4.0,cute but not a winner,Great idea ; cute monkey but my 6 month old great neice didn't like it.she would not use it at all.
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub is Great!,"At first I thought this was the dumbest gift for someone to buy us, but lo and behold, my son's Wubbanub monkey is his favorite lovey.  It's great for his small hands and I think even after he's done with the pacifier part, he'll still love snuggling and playing with it.  I advise getting two of the same kinds though, right from the start, so you can easily wash and let one dry and still have one to use.  Highly recommended!"
Baby,3.0,Fun but careful with antennas,I bought this toy for my two-months-old baby. I overall like the pattern and the color contrast. I know that developmentally these patterns and colors are very stimulating. The baby stares at them and definitely is interested in the toy but my mother raised the concern that because baby's movement are not very coordinated he can hurt his eyes with the bugs' antennas or legs. The tip of the antennas and legs are protected with a hard glue that can hurt their eyes when they are moving their hands close to their faces. I still like the toy but what I do now is that I put them at eyesight for stimulation but avoid wrapping them around his hands to prevent him from hurting his eyes.
Baby,4.0,Helpful for sealing Avent bottles.,"This was the perfect addition to our bottle collection. I'm a breastfeeding mom who pumps for one bottle a day and am happy to be able to store milk in the fridge and then simply exchange these inserts for the nipple. Great purchase if you're using Avent bottles already. With that said, it advertizes that you can write on the lids... I'm not really sure how one would do this (with what kind of pen) and be able to reuse."
Baby,3.0,Remember it's for Apple not by Apple...,"I had to have this. I saw it at the Apple store about a week after I found out I was pregnant and knew I would register for it just like I HAD to register for a Kitchenaid mixer as soon as I was engaged... It works. Usually. I like taking screen shots and I like that it one tap zooms. It's VERY easy to move the camera and has great display - and there are 4 of us in my house with iPhones and 2 of us with iPads so everyone can easily connect and stalk the baby. Problem is, if your wifi sucks, this product sucks. It loses connection even when WiFi doesn't suck. I'm not thrilled with the settings for movement/sound. I put it on 2 for sound alerts and a door shutting ACROSS the house will make it go off but the baby has to be crying decently to get it to go off. It was confusing to set up but still be able to unplug from internet directly. The actual instructions/app functionality is rudimentary at best. The app itself is where this EXPENSIVE product falls short. I didn't have any problems with I updated my OS6 like many complained of but I wish I had done more research into video monitors instead of blindly deciding that this Apple app product was the one I had to have. I hope something new comes out to compete with it's crappy app software."
Baby,4.0,proctorhills,The items was shipped and received on time with no damage.  This was for my four month old grandaughter. She enjoys them.
Baby,5.0,Love love love,This is one of the best things I have ever purchased!  The battery doesn't last long but besides that its great.
Baby,4.0,Great buy,This provided hours of fun for my son it was worth every penny. It was a little smaller than i imagined but it still is a great buy.
Baby,5.0,Perfect. Just what you need,"This is really the perfect stroller bag.  It fits two drinks perfectly, as well as some extras in the middle.  Nothing fancy, just a great item at a reasonable price."
Baby,5.0,Awesome for infants just learning pacifier,"Love this! My infant 6 week favorite. He still does not keep pacifier in by himself all the time, but the weight of this helps. He loves the softness of the pacifier:) I have 2 monkeys just in case he lost one. They also wash well gentle cycle."
Baby,1.0,In the End it has to Work,"My wife and I purchased the Wiithings Smart Baby Monitor about a month ago.  It seemed awesome at the time being able to monitor our baby from our iPhones thus eliminating the need to carry an extra monitor.  But, not more than two weeks later, the application stopped working on our iPhones.  The application on our iphones (4S) would kept showing \\""Connection Error Unable to retrieve Smart Baby Monitor connection information.\\""  My wife actually had found out that the monitor stopped working the next day when she saw this message on her phone.  I immediately contacted Wiithings and they responded within 24 hours.  Unfortunately, it was apparent that this was a known issue as support provided us with a PDF document on how to correct the problem!!  Being in IT, I could not bring myself to accept a product where a particular issue was so prevalent that a procedural guide was created on how to correct the problem.  In addition, it seemed that this issue would be reoccurring and not a one time fix.  Thoughts our of newborn daughter screaming through the night as we slept peacefully were playing through our minds.  The other thing that was annoying was the fact that there was a delay between what was seen/heard on the application and what was happening where the monitor was placed (baby room).  It was almost like watching something in slow motion as you could see the baby's arm move slowly from left to right like a someone flipping the pages of a book with a picture.  I am sure this was due to the Bluetooth connection but establishing a LAN line to the monitor was not something we were interested in doing.<br /><br />So, we sent the monitor back to Amazon who promptly refunded our purchase.  We ended up buying the Motorola [[ASIN:B004VL2VRO Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 Inch]]."
Baby,4.0,is perfect for what i needed,"We were looking for a camera to keep an eye out on our daughter. I read several reviews about various cameras and  intially decided to go for the Foscam because of the price and they got decent reviews. I spent over 6 hours trying to get these things set up. I was able to get them working at home and on my iphone (but not remotely). I started delving into port forwarding and a whole bunch of other technical things I don't really understand. I watched you tube videos on setting these up and searched all over the web for articles to help me, but I still got stuck. In the end my frustration won and I decided to return these. I got the ibaby and called it a day. The ibaby is more expensive and may not have all the features of the foscam but I set it up in about 2 minutes and it still does what we are looking for.I did have to do a little bit of searching to figure out how to view the camera from my phone without wifi but it can be done and the instructions on doing this are so much clearer than they were for the foscam."
Baby,5.0,Indispensable! Let your baby be the judge.,"This mobile is hands down one of the top 5 BEST baby purchases I made! My son loves it so much that when the mobile stops spinning, baby just stares at it and starts crying for it to come back on again. It really has allowed him to enjoy his crib, and his room for a looong while.  Perfect in the morning when I need to get myself ready and he's got morning energy to expend. What makes this mobile so indispensable in our home:<br />- Batteries last a long time and we use this several times a day!<br />- The toys are very colorful and face down so when baby is lying in crib looking up, it's like they are dancing for him.<br />- 3 music / 1 rainforest noise options are all great and provide good change of pace for baby.<br />- the leaves open and close while the toys spin making this very 'interactive' and holds baby's attention for a looong time.<br />- The music and entertainment last a very long time (maybe 45 min? - I lose track of time while he's in his crib and it feels like hours :-) of 'free' time so I can get other things done<br />- Sometimes we get to add our own animal soundtrack as the animals spin and baby looves that too!<br />- Nightlight is a special touch!  Now, I've only turned on the nightlight several times when I was desperate to calm him down in his crib at bedtime and nothing else worked. He was mesmerized when he saw the light! So I use it as a treat. Eventually when (and if) he tires of the mobile, we will use the nightlight more. But it's great to have this added option to extend the life of the product.<br /><br />One challenge: the leaves and the spinning can get stuck after a few months of play. We opened one up and the inside parts are made of plastic. It looked like the lubricant used to make the gears run smoothly were dried up. So adding more lube will get this back to normal. It's a little tough to put back together and takes patience. But what a worth-it product!!!!!"
Baby,5.0,He loved it,Our son loved this mobile when he was little.  Now it is nice that you can take off the animals and still have a crib toy that plays music.  This dual purpose makes it worth so much more than a basic mobile.
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,I bought this for my grandchild.  It works really well keeping the pacifier in the baby's mouth and it keeps you from losing the pacifier.
Baby,3.0,Doesn't work on parent-facing strollers,"Seems well made, but doesn't work on my stroller, or probably any parent-facing stroller. It hangs right in baby's face. I have the Jj cole broadway stroller"
Baby,5.0,good,"buy for my baby, it's ok<br />it's very good<br />when the baby come soon, I can use it for my baby<br />he will loving it"
Baby,5.0,"Good addition to Avent milk ""system""","These caps are great for the working pumping mom of an Avent bottle family. I pump into an avent bottle, put a cap on it, and then it's easy to transport. Our nanny then just puts a nipple on the same bottle when ready to feed our daughter. It cuts the amount of dirty bottles in HALF (a big deal in our house)."
Baby,3.0,nice mobile,"This mobile is very cute and was easy to put together.  The motor isn't really that loud, but it drowns out the rainforest sounds which was a bummer since that is a big reason as to why I got it - the music is fine though.  I just wish there was a better volume setting.  The undersides of the leaves aren't as shimmery as I thought they would be either.  The LED light on the remote and the unit don't seem to be working but that's not a big deal for me.  I like that it can convert to a music box after the mobile isn't needed anymore.  All in all its cute and I'd get it again."
Baby,5.0,great monitor for the gadget loving parent,works with iphone and ipad perfect.  multiple people can monitor at the same time. works when youre at home and remote.<br />setup is very easy.<br />automatically updates itself as withings puts out new features
Baby,5.0,Excellent,Easy to setup. Works very well. I was looking for this product for a while finally found it here. It exceeded my expectations.
Baby,5.0,perfect,"el producto es lo esperado, se ve de buena calidad y lo comprpraqdo llena mis espectativas, sin ningun problema que decir"
Baby,5.0,Must have for baby if they like a paci,"Prevents paci from rolling into the land of nowhere. Saved my sanity when my babies were about 6months old.  Now that they are almost 1, they love the little animal.  My son will not use an ordinary paci to go to sleep. Had to buy some back ups!"
Baby,1.0,I want to love it.......really.,"We got the monitor and wanted to love it, but it seems like it works sporadically. The monitor connects via Bluetooth and from our home wifi network 70% of the time. I attempted to contact Withings and they do not respond in a helpful way. We got the monitor and it drops the wifi connection. I even returned one and got another, but the same. We got this monitor so my wife and I could use it with our IPads, but it doesn't always connect when we are not home and on another wifi network or using cellular. Now I wonder if you can connect to the monitor from outside of your home wifi network?<br /><br />Contacting Withings to get support is non-existent. I am only able to talk with them via their website or email and get non helpful responses. I ask questions via email, they respond hours/days later telling me to reconfigure. Really? The devise is around $300 and it does not always work and no support from the company. You would think the company would take child safety seriously. I still really want it to work, but don't feel comfortable with the monitor cutting out randomly or just not working."
Baby,4.0,Best Monitor Ever!!!,"I'm updating this review but I'm thrilled to report that the iOS7 update has greatly improved the performance of the viewing app on the iPhone 5!  I'm am so thrilled!  I've struggled with it for a year, still loving the monitor despite it's imperfect performance on iOS6 and the iPhone 5.  It really is a one of a kind monitor!  I also love that you can finally view the monitors (at the same time) from any computer.  This is huge!!!<br /><br />Favorite features: the two way talking feature, the light (I used a green & red light to show my toddler when it was time to sleep and when it was time to get out of bed), and being able to remote monitor.  These three features made the monitor unique, even among other iPhone compatible monitors.<br /><br />The two main complaints I've seen in reviews on various sites about this monitor are true, tho neither were deal breakers for me-<br />1) the monitor shuts down/ loses connectivity once or twice a night, and if you're sleeping you don't know this has occurred, which is troubling if you're monitoring a small child.  I just solve this by using a cheap ($15ish) audio only monitor during the night. If baby wakes, I hear him on the audio monitor and can then turn on this monitor to see what he's doing.  I'm totally fine with this arrangement.<br />2) The night vision isn't awesome, but I've used several other regular video monitors and didn't find this one any worse than those.  Certainly the closer to the child the camera is, the clearer the picture is.  Sometimes the night vision adjusts itself and makes the picture a lot darker (making the picture very hard to see) or a lot brighter (which shows the child clearer).  You can't adjust the night vision yourself, it just does it on its own, and not always for the better.  However, all in all, the night vision is fine.  I appreciate being able to see even my child's outline.<br /><br />Note: When using with more than 1 monitor, there is NOT a great way of switching between monitors- there are about 7 key strokes to get between monitors and you have to do it manually.  It doesn't rotate between monitors automatically.  That makes viewing on the computer nice.  I think of this monitor as my way to see my kids napping during the day and at night when I'm away from home (say on a date and a babysitter is home viewing on my iPad or computer).  I love that I can see my kids sleeping when I'm not home with them.  Withinings told me they were working on a way to swipe between monitors (swipe right/left to see the various monitors) but that it could be awhile before that's available.<br /><br />I love love love love this monitor and I welcome any further questions!there are about 7 key strokes to get between monitors and you have to do it manually.

Baby,5.0,My kid loves it&#34;,"This is a brilliant invention. My twins like smoothie pacifiers anywa, and this helps the keep it in their mouths. The only drawback is its hard to clean and sterilize, but well worth it anyway."
Baby,5.0,So cute!,"My son is just now getting really into toys, and this is one of his favorites! It is so cute and has a lot of entertaining variety - crinkly, different fabrics, the rings on the tail are different textures, the little knight squeaks... He loves it, and it is nice that it travels well and is such good quality!"
Baby,5.0,This baby monitor is AWESOME!,"Having just got a newborn I was in the market for an iPhone friendly baby monitor. I came across this product and I have to be honest, I was dubious how it would perform. I have bought many iPhone accessories that use Wifi before and sometimes they over promise and under deliver. Not so with the Withings WithBaby product. This thing is awesome. It was extremely easy to setup, recognised my home network immediately and configuration was done in under 30 secs. It works completely as advertised and not only that it had a few surprises for me.<br /><br />I was sceptical it work across the Internet and 3G. Tried it...no problem! Of course, performance is a little degraded as you are running it across mobile data but still it performed acceptably. I was also surprised that Withings had taken the time to make native iPad apps and also that more than 1 person can connect at a time. Let me say that again. MORE THAN ONE PERSON CAN CONNECT AT A TIME. That was pretty awesome. Both my wife and I can monitor my little guy simultaneously.<br /><br />All in all....awesome product I use on my iPhone 5 and iPad. I can't speak highly enough of it. Oh...and nicely designed as well!"
Baby,5.0,love it,My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could
Baby,5.0,My 4 month old LOVES this,"My daughter just loves this toy! Their are all types colors and textures to explore. She loves chewing on the teether and the rings and squeezing the crinkly \\""foot\\"" of the giraffe. The entire bottom of the giraffe crinkles too which was a nice surprise. Overall a great product for this age to keep them entertained and happy!"
Baby,5.0,This is so cute!,"My daughter decided on a nursery with a dragon theme!  Items have been hard to come by.  This dragon is very cute, seems to have a lot of stimulating details for the baby and I know she will love it!"
Baby,5.0,Monkey Pacifier,I had seen a baby with this pacifier and thought it was cute.  I purchased it for my grandchild.  It is real cute and her mom had wanted it without my knowing it.
Baby,4.0,This is the cutest thing!,I bought this for my three month old son. The passy was too small for his liking but I knew that might be an issue when I bought it. But it was too cute not to give it a try. Since my son wouldn't take the passy I cut it out and sewed his on instead. Realistically I could've just bought a small stuffed animal and sewed his in cheaper but you live and learn. This is for younger babies. Wish the company made these for different ages. But me sewing his in works just fine.
Baby,5.0,so happy with this!,this is a great product. it works very well on my bugaboo camelon stroller. very happy with this purchase and the price was PERFECT!
Baby,5.0,Excellent.,Fits my stroller and holds both my Camelbak water bottle and my coffee cup. All the essentials for walking the big kids to the bus stop in the morning!
Baby,1.0,Defective,I am very disappointed with this monitor.  Can't review other than it did not connect at all to my iPhone or iPad and was thus completely defective useless.  Sent it back.  A waste of time.
Baby,5.0,Amazing!,My daughter loved her Wubbanub pacifier.  She had 3 in total and we never lost any of them.  She was able to put the pacifier in and our of her mouth at a young age- and she enjoyed cuddling with the stuffed animal.<br /><br />Wubbanub also has really good customer service- when my daughter started teething she was really rough on her pacifiers and the pacifier started tearing off the animal.  The company mailed us a replacement for free.<br /><br />We also found them simple to clean.  When the stuffed animal got dirty (beyond spot cleaning) we put them in the washing machine.  We laid them out to dry and they were fluffy and as good as new.
Baby,5.0,Baby's BFF,We got this as an impulse buy the day after we left the hospital.  9 months later it is still our #1 baby buy.  When she was swaddled it stayed in her mouth better because the stuffed guy kept it in place.  In the beginning it was easy to replace the paci in the car because the frog was easy to grab onto from the front seat.  Regular pacifiers would drop down to the bottom of the car seat.  She also learned to replace the pacifier a lot faster with the frog to hold onto.  We love our wubbanub.  I read some reviews about washing it--I throw it in the washing machine.  It comes out almost all the way dry.  I either let it air dry or give it right to her.
Baby,5.0,Lamaze High Contrast Wrist Rattles,"My baby loved these rattles the moment we showed these to her. She just smiled and smiled at them. I bought two sets of these so we could dangle them from her carseat when traveling, since they are soft. She has now outgrown these and moved on to bigger and better things. However, I have fond memories of how much she enjoyed these rattles. We dangled these from her bouncy chair, and had more of a success with her enjoying these there, then placing them on her wrists. They were never a big hit on her wrists."
Baby,4.0,Love this!,My son has always gone right to sleep being memorized by this cute mobile! I love the little nightlight and he loves the rotating animals. I really like that I can have the bug noises on because he has another toy that plays music so they go nicely together. The remote doesn't work all that well but I haven't really needed it but a couple of times. I would definitely recommend! :)
Baby,3.0,Good for a few months,"As a little guy my son really liked being able to kick his feet and here the little rattle and as he got older enjoyed batting at the toys. But, once he could roll over he got irritated by not being able to roll over the hard sides and the toys above him only kept him entertained for a short while. I would definitely recommend getting the bigger version of this mat as I feel I should have. Babies would get more more use out of it!"
Baby,5.0,my kid loves it..,"my kid loves it.. the music, the the moving animals,are great...<br />if can come with more different music will be even better..<br />overall, great product"
Baby,1.0,"After 1 month, still doesnt work!!!!!","First, let me start by saying that i have never left feedback for anything before (and i buy a lot of products on Amazon....several a week for several years).  This product, however, has earned my first review....and it is a terrible one.  I have never before been so frustrated with a customer service experience and product expereince as this one. Perhaps it is my fault for thinking that a \\""mom and pop\\"" company could produce a product that every parent wants and no other company offers.  Apparently the reason that no other company offers this (as of yet) is because it is terribly difficult to do so with any consistency of success).  Let me admit, that there is some success but for many it simply wont work, or wont work very long.  My brother in law bought one of these first and had so much difficulty in setting it up (he is not a technical idiot either) that he had to call in his friend who is works for an internet servce provider as a Technical Support Manager to eventually get it set up.  It took this guy 5 HOURS to set it up and he is an expert...he told my brother in law that he cant believe they actually sell this product to the general public!  IN SPITE OF THIS....i bought one (stupid, i know), hoping that i would be one of the lucky ones.  Here is my story:<br />FIRST one i bought was delivered as new, but was actually used (this is not necessarily iBaby's fault, but the sellers).  It had some sort of strawberry jelly on it and was missing the installations CD).  I never even tried it and returned it.<br />SECOND one i got arrived new as advertised....unfortunately even new it didnt work.  After calling their \\""customer service\\"" number (WHICH is really just an answering machine that you have to wait days to hear back from) and troubleshooting for 2 sessions over 4 days, they advised that i had received a \\""lemon\\"" and that i should return it.<br />THIRD one i received, started off better then either of the first 2.  It actually worked, BUT ONLY OVER MY LOCAL WIFI NETWORK...not remotely (which is why i bought this).  At first, i figured it was just my settings and that i could fix it later.  I called \\""customer service answering machine\\"" again (twice) and finally got a call back where i was told i would have to email customer service the info (dont know why i couldnt explain it over the phone?)  I did email and heard back pretty quickly...ahh relief. That relief was short lived, when i followed their intstrustions to only discover that it still didnt work.  emailed again, got more instructions...still didnt work.  emailed again and was asked to send screenshot photos of my router settings.  they then told me that (and i am QUOTING THEM), \\""you have everything set up correctly and i dont know why it would work?\\""  THis entire process has taken almost an entire month and probably more then 20 hours of work and i still dont have a working ibaby camera and have no direction from their customer service to solve this.  PARENTS, please do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  it is terrible.  my suggestion is to wait until a larger company tackles this product idea and buy theirs."
Baby,5.0,gift,this was a gift for a co-worker whose wife had a baby.  they were trilled as they had used them with previous children.
Baby,1.0,Buyer be ware,"Buyer be ware. Baby monitor randomly stops working. Last night the sound stopped working and we did not hear our baby cry. The only way to get support is via email. It takes days to hear back from anyone. When they do respond, their answers don't make any sense. It seems like support is being outsourced somewhere. Many other problems reported so do your research first."
Baby,5.0,Wrist rattles,These are very bright and colorful they were very reasonably priced and I cannt wait until I can see them on my grandbaby
Baby,5.0,So Cute,Love this for new baby.  Monkey is so cute and very soft.  Great idea and pacifier isn't falling onto the floor all the time.
Baby,5.0,we love wubbanubs!,"They are lifesavers.  They are cute to look at, and fun for the kids.  Plus they really help the little ones who don't quite have the motor skills to put their pacifiers in their own mouths.  These are much bigger and even the younger babies can manage to push them back in.  And they're easier to catch before they hit the ground."
Baby,1.0,Not reliable,"Difficult to use, does not always work. Disconnects automatically. Way over priced and over promised. Customer Service is slow to respond."
Baby,3.0,Funny red slide,"The red slide to open from the top work poorly.  I love that it is a nicer container than the ones that come pre filled, but the red opening needs to be reworked."
Baby,1.0,Not So Great,"We registered for this along with the Skip Hop Messenger Diaper Bag. The Wipes Case doesn't keep wipes wet! They begin to dry immediately & do not stay moist. The red slider is difficult to slide & overall, the item is bulky. Like other reviewers, I found the case itself to be sturdy, but what does it matter when you're stuck with dry wipes...that you cannot grab b/c the slider sticks?"
Baby,5.0,Wanted to love it,Purchased this for my double city mini jogger and it didn't work out too well. I'm sure if in had single it would work so much better. This thing a made from quality products and I would most definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a super sturdy cup holder. I purchased a double wide JL Childress organizer/cup holder and this is way better & much more sturdy. returned both
Baby,5.0,Handy!,"I bought this for my Britax B-Agile stroller and have used it on my Abiee stroller too. It works on both.  It can hold a sippy cup, most any cups/bottles I've put in it, along with my phone and wallet.  Its super handy to move to either and hold my stuff too.  I've used it for about a year now and it still works and holds up to my use!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"This works out very well. I can keep everything organized and easy to get to. Worth the. Ones, I love it."
Baby,5.0,A must have baby item!,". I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way.<br />3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer."
Baby,3.0,inconsistent quality,"We purchased 2 separate wubbanubs in different orders; the first one had good quality stitching and a perfect pacifier. We lost the first one, so we opened the second one and the quality was not the same. Open threads and seam had a small hole without any use, the pacifier had a longer nipple so we are returning the defective one and ordering two more; hopefully we will get lucky!<br /><br />Our 3 month old loves it, well he loved his first one, and wasnt that excited as the backup one felt different...."
Baby,5.0,great,the baby loves this. the monkey makes it more easy to keep track of and also helps somewhat with keeping her from spitting it out.
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"This little organizer fits great on our MacClaren stroller, and also on our jogger.  The velcro is really strong so it doesn't slip, the cup holder is stretchy to hold various size cups, and they is a little secret zipper part to old ID, small wallet, keys, etc.  Great product."
Baby,5.0,Cute!,I was looking for a while for a cute unisex toy mobile for the crib and found this one. Only tool you need for assembly is a screwdriver. You don't even need the instructions. A first I thought the volume was too soft but then again.. It's right next to your baby's ear  for the purpose of putting them to sleep so how loud is it really supposed to be..  I was just surprised it takes 3 d cell batteries but its worth it
Baby,5.0,Easily the best,"Decided to upgrade the monitor for the second child, and wish we had bought this for the first.  All features function as advertised and many better than expected.  When I am in the market for a scale or blood pressure monitor (as those are the only other products they make), I will certainly go directly back to Withings."
Baby,5.0,It works well,I like think it is good and I like to watch from anywhere and it has good quality I would by it a gen.
Baby,5.0,Great - my son loved it!,"Wonderful because my four month old son could manipulate it himself after just a few days. Saved lots of time searching for a pacifier, especially when driving!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable!!!!!,This was the perfect binky for my son! As a newborn the monkey could lay on his chest and hold the pacifier in place until he figured out how to keep it in his mouth. He's now 8 weeks old and loves to snuggle with his little monkey friend. Very durable too! I just throw it into the washing machine every few days for a bath and he still looks like new. Super cute and well worth the money!!!
Baby,5.0,Saves you money,Use these for breast milk storage in my Avent bottles. Saves me money because I don't have to buy as many breast milk storage bags. I wish I had the space and money to only use bottles because these don't leak and I have had no problem with them not sealing properly in the freezer.
Baby,2.0,Junk,This mobile is absolute junk!  From day one the thing would stop spinning at times unless you tapped it to start again.  Now after two weeks the only thing it's good for is playing the music.  It doesn't spin at all now.  Very frustrating when your 3 month old is captured by it as she falls asleep and then it quits working.  So disappointed!
Baby,5.0,Great toy,The baby spent a full 20 mins mesmerized by the toy when we put it up. He was oonly 3 weeks old at the time!!
Baby,5.0,Fabulous!!,"We have really enjoyed this monitor.  Our last monitor went out and even though our son is almost out growing a monitor we still wanted to be able to on him due to asthma problems.  Also, we can be out of town and still look in on him while the grandparents are taking care of him."
Baby,5.0,Much more than I expected,Great gift. I bought two one for my landlords first born son and one for my second born granddaughter. They absolutely love them.<br />Much more than what I expected; the colors are so bright and the material is soft and cuddly and even though they were newborns they were attracted to their dragons immediately. The photo does not let you really know how wonderful these dragons are. They are so well put together with lots of fun surprises. Now one child is almost a toddler and he still loves his dragon. I bought the dragons because both were born in the year of the dragon. Perfect gifts. Other parents always ask where they can buy one and I lead them to Amazon.com.<br />I trust Amazon.com with all my online purchases. Thank you Amazon
Baby,5.0,Love the Lamaze toys,My daughter has two Lamaze toys and she loves both of them.  Sir Prance A Lot is very cute and she especially likes the tail rings.
Baby,3.0,Purchased it for the Baby Jogger City Mini,"The size and shape are great, but because of the curse of my City Mini Stroller's handle this seems to tip back quite a bit. Maybe in time it will settle into place, but it seems to be an awkward fit."
Baby,2.0,not what i expected,"these hardly fit on my 7 week olds feet, as they have very little stretch. the rattles are also super quiet, so he isnt that interested in the sound."
Baby,5.0,great,Use these rings with my avent bottles. Perfect for pumping and work and bringing milk home. No problems with leaking - even when the bag turns over.
Baby,1.0,Makes loud clicking noise when rotating,"I can't use the rotate setting because it makes a loud, continuous clicking noise. The reason I bought it was because it moved so I regret this purchase. It happened the 2nd time I used it, so it's not like it worked for a while & then broke."
Baby,4.0,Nice for joovy caboose,Nice and cheap product. It's sturdy and well made. It doesn't get five stars from me because its not deep enough for my taste to hold cups or drinks
Baby,5.0,Great monitor!,"We also read all of the reviews, but two who had hooked it up properly gave it good reviews.  Since this monitor was very adaptable with night vision camera, audio and alerts, we decided to order it for our great grandchild's room. We figured we would just return it if it didn't work.  My son in law had it connected quickly and with no problems.  He also fixed my iPhone so I am seeing baby in live mode nearly 2000 miles away!  There was some question about the router being strong enough so we also purchased a new wireless router taking advantage of black friday sales. Router was connected first, then the monitor.  It is awesome.  Audio is great, photo is great.<br />This has been a great purchase.  If you are not super techie, ask a friend who is to help with the set up, you'll be glad you did.<br />I tried to send a screen shot, but it wasn't video so didn't work."
Baby,5.0,Amazing product and customer service!,"We got this off of thinkgeek.com when our daughter was about 1 month old.  My husband works on Sunday nights and wanted an easy way to say goodnight to our daughter without having to do so in person.  We fell in love with this product.  When we went out of town, we were able to \\""spy\\"" on the grandparents that took care of her to make sure that she was down for her nap/bedtime when we suggested.  This is a total gem for when you leave your child with a sitter and expect them to follow your sleep schedule guidelines.  We are able to sooth our daughter if we are unavailable (as in my husband's case on Sunday nights).<br /><br />My love for this product was before a situation happened, but I love the company even more now.  We were cleaning our daughter's room when the power supply cord was accidentally broken out of the socket.  We were devastated because no other power supply we had came in handy and we had been without the product for a few months when I decided to email their support with the situation, I told them that we would not mind paying for a replacement part.  The customer service representative asked me for my shipping address and let me know the company would be sending one out immediately.  We were so shocked at how fast of a response and the fact that the company would send it free of charge.  Great job, Withings!"
Baby,5.0,Sealing discs,What a great idea to be able to turn your bottle into a sealed container. I never used Avent bottles for feeding but I have an Avent breast pump and would store my milk in the bottles. These were great.
Baby,5.0,Great for price compared to others,"I use this for my Baby Jogger City Mini Double stroller. It takes up one half of the handle bars. This product was MUCH cheaper than any of the comparable aftermarket products. I was honestly worried about the quality but it is very well made. The cupholders have held everything from a soda can to a 32 oz fountain drink. It fits securely on my stroller, and I can leave it on while folding it. Would buy again<br />UPDATE DECEMBER 2014:<br />I have used this stroller cupholder caddy for well over two years now. I have used it on four different stroller (umbrella, jogger, double, etc). I originally purchased it as a \\""budget item\\"", but I have since tried several other more expensive competitors to this product (including the skip hop one), and I can honestly say this is the one I ALWAYS go back to. It has fit on every stroller I have tried. I even occasionally use it while grocery shopping so my drink doesn't spill! It's very easy to take off and reattach. I also have one that I attached to the top bunk of my boys' bunk bed. It works perfectly and he now has a place to put his water bottle, some tissues, a flashlight, etc. I always strongly recommend this cupholder to family, friends, and inquiring strangers. It is well made for the price. And since it is so economical it's affordable to replace it if it happens to get ruined. My favorite part is probably the wire around the opening. It allows me to easily place drinks inside, and I can usually do it one handed. That can't be said for the Skip Hop competitor to this product. While I appreciate the little zip off pouch and cute prints that company offers, this cupholder is just more functional. It may be basic, but sometimes the basics are best!"
Baby,2.0,They don't match with the bottles,"It's weird, but with some bottles they work and with others not. It's really a pity because the price is fair."
Baby,5.0,Great fit for both of my strollers,Works great!  Fits the Baby Jogger and my Bob strollers perfectly.  Holds  a lot and is pretty sturdy.  Thank you!
Baby,3.0,Not bad,"I'm updating my original review because it is now working over our wifi.  Once you figure out how to update your configuration for your wifi from WEP to WPA, it connects and works pretty well.<br /><br />They really need to provide better instructions for changing your wifi settings.  There is nothing in the manual or online about this that I could find."
Baby,5.0,Best thing ever!!!,"Good protective case, easy to get out. Wish I bought this three years ago when my son was a baby!"
Baby,5.0,Very cute and works great!,"This is a real good toy for babies who have to do tummy time and are learning to crawl. With all the colorful toys it encourages them to crawl, set up and reach for the toys. It works very well to get them to like tummy time better."
Baby,5.0,Still loves it,My son still loves this lil thing many months after he should have cast is asunder.  Its his car friend now.
Baby,2.0,Not so great,"Too expensive for what it offers. The sounds are boring. Few pre-programmed tunes that get annoying soon. The recording function just remembers a sequence of buttons that you push. For our kid, the buttons are hard to push, so he lost interest quickly. Not worth the money imho."
Baby,4.0,Love Love Love IT!,"Got this as a Gift for my 1st baby, and now my 2nd baby having it @ his crib (we have this almost 2 years and still in good condition).  Good quality from Fisher-Price, beautiful melodies that enchants my LO to sleep.  Remote isn't working well sometimes, but no big deal about it. Definitely a GREAT GIFT for any Newborns!"
Baby,4.0,Fits Nicely on Baby Jogger City Mini,"Velcro straps are adjustable for a good fit on the Baby Jogger City Mini.  My only issue is the 2 pockets for water bottles is a bit snug.  It seems to fit small water bottles fine, but anything bigger just wont do.  Still, very handy and convenient accessory for my stroller."
Baby,4.0,Good but I Hope to See Improvement.,"The monitor works great. I love that I can hear and see my child from anywhere in the world. I have very little bad to say about this product. The reason it can't get 5 stars from me is because there are two improvements I believe that need to be made and should have been included from the beginning.<br />1. You can only view, continuously, from a cellular network for 5 minutes at a time. I can't find a good reason for this.<br />2. You can't play YOUR music to the baby. There is a list of 5 default lullabies that come with the monitor but I would prefer to play the songs I choose from my phone to my child.<br /><br />If they  get those changes, which can probably just be software changes, I would GLADLY give it 5 stars. Even with those flaws it is the best monitor that I have seen."
Baby,5.0,Great rattles,My baby loves looking at these rattles because of the contrast. They are the perfect size and not flimsy like other ones out there
Baby,4.0,Love this!,"It's always hanging on our pram. The red button was hard to slide at first but over time it became easier to access with one hand. It's never opened accidentally for me and we have been quite rough with it - just don't overfill it. I've had it for over 4 months and loving it. The best thing about it is that each time I need wipes, I never have to dig into the bag! The outside is easy to clean too so even if I have sticky fingers, I can just grab my wipes then wipe the case."
Baby,5.0,Great buy,"Glad I bought this.  Our stroller, the CityMini, needed some cupholders and storage and this was a great solution.  I didn't realize it had a little zipper pouch on the inside but I love that part.  You can easily fit 2 large Starbucks drinks in it, plus the center part is great for keys, phone, burp cloth, hand sanitizer, whatever!  It easily velcroed on in seconds and doesn't seem like it will budge. Seems easy to clean too. Great idea!"
Baby,3.0,Size Not Correct,"They are very pretty when you receive them; however, they are very long and narrow and I was not able to squeeze my son's feet in to them (he was only 3 months old at the time.)  I think they work better for a new born or very small thin baby."
Baby,4.0,LOVE this mobile!,"I got this mobile for my first son and and am now using it for him 2 years later, AS WELL AS for his little brother. I love the classical songs, with the Mozart option being my favorite. They are so soothing and they last just the right amount of time, not too long, not too short. It has two sound levels so you can have it very quiet or louder, but not too loud. The light emitted is perfect for nighttime, it's enough to let the baby to gaze into it but not too bright. The remote is fantastic for those times when it does cut off before your child's asleep and for someone who sleeps with the babies in the same room, I can turn it on from my bed in the middle of the night if little one rouses. I not only use it to soothe for naptime and bedtime, but also just for play; both of my little guys loved to lay in their crib and stare up at the mobile and kick their legs and smile and coo and laugh. I've been able to get a lot of stuff done because of this mobile! I've only had to replace the batteries once so far in two years, and I use it CONSTANTLY.<br />One star pegged off because the leaves can and do bend if you don't handle it properly, which can cause the animals to get stuck. But it's nothing that a little rebending on my part couldn't fix. Highly recommended!"
Baby,4.0,"So far so good, works very well with iPhone 4s and Sony tablet on Android!","I've only had this monitor for 2 days so my review is based on my experience of the past 48 hours.  To be honest, I was a bit afraid of purchasing this since I've read some reviews about connectivity issues.  However, there aren't many choices out there which allows remote connection from outside of your home so I took a gamble and I must say that so far I am pleasantly surprised on how well it works.<br /><br />1st, I am not the geekiest person in the world, I am a 34 yr old working mom, do know a little about computers/networks.  I've actually set up the monitor (in less than 10 min) without any help from Hubby. I do want to mention that for those of you experiencing dropped connections over wifi, you may want to try assigning Static IPs on each device that has access to your WiFi.  Currently, we have more than 10 various devices (computers/laptops/tablet/iPhones/PS3,Wii,XBox, etc) accessing our home WiFi network and in the past we've encountered &#34;hand-shake&#34; issues when allowing the router to randomly assign IPs (we would loose connections on these devices).  After doing some research, we switched to a method which we assigned a unique IP address for each device that's connected to our WiFi and we have not encounter any issues since then.<br /><br />I also downloaded the BETA version of the Android app on my Sony Tablet and the only time I lost connection is when I place the tablet back on the cradle for charging.  This is not a huge issue for me since I typically have the Sony Tablet in the cradle next to my bed and as long as it is continuously in the cradle, I don't loose connections.<br /><br />I've also tested the iPhone app over 4G network while I was out doing some shopping, again no connection issue and I can see my baby just fine (though video quality is a bit lower than WiFi).<br /><br />Also, you can have multiple devices accessing the Video/Audio feed at the same time which is a very nice feature.  This allows me and hubby to monitor our son while the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update.hile the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update."
Baby,1.0,Will not connect,"Tech that doesn't work is normally an irritant, in a baby monitor it is more than that. Works great for a short period of time and then will not connect at all. On the withings site a proposed remedy is to:<br />&#34;Reset your baby monitor by the attached process<br />Remove the WithBaby app from your iPhone<br />Turn ON the Bluetooth on your iPhone<br />Connect your iPhone to your Wi-Fi network<br />Install WithBaby once again and follow the installation process&#34;<br /><br />After doing this repeatedly and getting at most 2 days of proper functioning, on a network with an airport extreme providing flawless connectivity to all other devices, I'm looking to invest in a device that works whether or not it has apple sequence styling."
Baby,4.0,Cute!,My son loves his wubbanub.  I love the extra weight the monkey adds to the pacifier so it's not as likely to fly around.  My only complaint is that the monkey is kind of challenging to clean.  I will there were some way the pacifier detached from the monkey.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Only one hand needed to use this wipes case! Each hand becomes a super multi-tasking tool once you become a mom and this wipes case makes life a little simpler! I love it and recommend it to every mom.
Baby,5.0,My favorite,This is my favorite for some reason. Lamaze is a great company for baby toys. Would buy again maybe even one for me.
Baby,4.0,great infant toy- but moose is better,"my daughter is 6 months old.. we've had this a few months.. she liked him, but mainly only chewed on his mirror tail.. We also have the Moose by this same company...she LOVED the Moose. And I have 2 friends who bought the moose and their babies love too!! Get him if he's available!"
Baby,4.0,Definitely worth purchasing.,"We have the rainforest activity mat and decided to get the mobile after seeing how fascinated our baby is with the 'mobile' on the mat - I'm so glad we did!  It's been amazing because now we can turn it on when we put her to bed sleepy and she will quietly watch the mobile and usually she will fall asleep rather than just cry like she used to.  Bedtime is much easier than it used to be!  My two complaints are that the remote doesn't seem to work, and the product description says that there are three different lengths of time but there aren't, unless I am really missing something."
Baby,5.0,Money Well Spent!,"I bought these for my daughter when she was two months old and she has consistently enjoyed them for the past four months. They definitely catch her attention and are constructed well. The rattle is loud enough for my little one to enjoy it. It is definitely a quieter rattle than some other toys, I prefer this for younger babies though -- so it isn't a negative. We do no put them on her wrists that often, she likes to hold them and chew on them now, but they still fit easily around my average-sized six month old's wrists.  We used to dangle them from her play gym and she would smile and babble at them. They are great to bring with you while traveling or to just have on hand in the diaper bag. Money well spent!"
Baby,4.0,Good function.,"Good stroller organizer. plenty space for bottles, cell phone, snack box, etc. the strip is sturdy and easy rape around the stroller hand held area. Use it every time when I have a walk with my baby.."
Baby,4.0,Handy for places besides the stroller,"I put this case in our car, hanging it from the headrest of the front seat, so that we can easily access wipes while on the go. The strap keeps the package out of the way and off the floor. It also means I'm not searching for wipes under the seat or buried in the glove compartment - they're always within easy reach.<br /><br />I like the hard plastic shell and appreciate that it's dishwasher safe. Like other reviewers, I have found the red button to be a bit temperamental, but I feel like I have the hang of it now. Also, I put a travel sized pouch of wipes into the case, keeping them in their plastic shell, to help maintain moisture."
Baby,5.0,"Oh my goodness, this thing is ADORABLE!","I did a lot of research before deciding on this toy. And I'm so happy I did. This toy is adorable, just absolutely adorable. The head of the horse has a bell in it, so it rings when you shake it, the feet are kinda crinkly and have black, red, and white on the bottoms of each hoof. The tail has two knobby rings perfect for them gums. The colors are so bright and fun, it's just perfect. The only complaint I have is that the Knight has a squeaker in his head that is very hard to squeak. But there's so much more going on with this toy that I doubt it really matters. Should I mention that I love the Renfest so this suits my taste like crazy? I can see this being a toy he has until he's much older. <3 it!"
Baby,5.0,Shocked and amazed at the ease of product replacement service,"My infant loved this from 3 weeks (we hung it over his bassinet via ceiling plant hook until it could hook onto the crib) on until it just quit rotating.  Our infant just loved watching it until they fell asleep.  When it quit we had an issue and I was really regretting buying it on Amazon (not aware of typical return replacement policies) because I thought it would be a nightmare to try and exchange for one that worked.  Instead it took me 30 seconds to go on our Amazon account and explain the defect after having the item 5+ months, then 3-4 days later a replacement arrives and the ups van takes the defect model back.  The whole exchange took less than 10 minutes (including taking down and boxing up the broken model), I didn't have to drive to a store and waste gas exchanging it and the replacement came so fast our infant didn’t have to go one restless night without their mobile.  I was so impressed with the service I bought a piano on Amazon afterwards.  Brick and Mortar stores beware this is just easier and reviews help.  Thanks for the great service!"
Baby,4.0,Cute!,"My little one loves staring at both the mobile and the light up part.  She's just mesmerized.  It plays rain forest sounds (her favorite) along with a few classical music selections. I do wish the timer was longer than 15 minutes though, maybe 30."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for baby jogger,"Purchased this or my baby jogger single stroller, works perfect and much cheaper than the baby jogger branded one. It also folds up when you collapse the stroller."
Baby,5.0,Big hit with mommy,"We bought these for a new grandbaby, a first born, and his mommy was very happy.  There is some kind of 'crinkle' noise in the material of the ladybugs for added interest.  Plus, they might even keep the tootsies warm.  Can't go wrong."
Baby,4.0,"Super cute, but wish they were a bit bigger",Love this idea and the colors. The bugs are perfect and my 3 month is just starting to really get excited when he sees these. My only complaint is that he is a chubby big baby and these just barely fit his wrists. I am afraid that within the next month we won't be able to velcro them anymore.
Baby,1.0,Fails to deliver what is needed of a Baby Monitor,"If you are shopping for this product then you've already decided that you need audio and video monitoring of your infant child and would like perhaps some extra features (temp, humidity) and possibly access from beyond the confines of your home...  This product cannot deliver these things.<br /><br />THIS DEVICE WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION - this is a fact.<br /><br />So, if your internet connection goes down or if the Withings servers go down - then the system will not allow you to monitor your infant child... therefore it simple fails to deliver what you need it to.<br /><br />Like other reviewers I really wanted this to be great. It looks good, it felt like an Apple product, I even bought it in the Apple store, but sadly this is a Beta product at best and the designers need to build in the sort of fail-safes which any parent knows are essential in order to have a reliable system for monitoring the health and security of your child.<br /><br />Be warned, don't be fooled by advice from sales staff that the system will continue to work on a local Wifi connection without an internet connection (e.g. Airport Express system).  It won't. When the device cannot contact the Withings servers for whatever reason beyond your control then you lose operation.<br /><br />Returned mine for a full refund and went instead for a Summer Peek Plus Internet Monitoring system which allows monitoring over standard radio signal (like the old systems) with an internet gateway for viewing from outside the home. This way the only thing that could fail would be a protracted powercut leading to the rechargeable batteries draining."
Baby,5.0,dragon toy,I love this so funny but forgot I ordered it my daughter is asking every where who sent it and I ordered other things I just forgot I ordered it but wanted her to have it to go with her dragon theme . thanks
Baby,2.0,Disappointing,"We ordered this you thinking that our 18 mo old or 4 mo old might be interested in this toy but neither of them are capable of pushing the buttons and our older child gets really frustrated when he can't make it work. Additionally, we were under the assumption that the music had words; instead, it plays very short songs although we do recognize most of them. The record feature is much too short. Overall, the toy really wasn't worth the price and you'd be better off buying a stuffed animal..."
Baby,1.0,guitar not tuneable,"this was the worst product I ever bought, I had to run out at the last minute to buy my granddaughter<br />another guitar, you cannot give a child a product that cannot be tuned when they want to play guitar."
Baby,3.0,Lamaze High Contrast Wrist Rattle,Only three stars....a bit flimsy.....and not interesting for infants.  Takes a bit of effort to get it on infant's flailing arms and get the bug on top.
Baby,4.0,Great for refilling wipes on the go,"My wife and I really like this skip hop baby wipes case. We buy the bulk pampers sensitive wipes and rather than using one of the thin cases that only hold enough for a few days, we can use the skip hop for more than a week of on the go changes. At first I was worried that the red switch would not stay in place and the wipes would dry out; however, we have been using our's for 9 months now and have not had a dry wipe yet. Great buy!"
Baby,5.0,Well made and cute,The buttons are easy to push and not too loud when they play.  It's a well made toy for teething baby.  Worth the money totally.
Baby,5.0,Christmas,"This toy is great for little ones, my daughter had been wanting it for a while now, so we got it for our little  five month old grand daughter for Christmas. It was a good price too."
Baby,5.0,fits perfect for city select double,"Great product - light weight and still holds 2 drinks, and snacks/cell phone in the middle!<br /><br />Love the adjustable velcro straps as I can put it down lower on the stroller so my son can munch on snacks while I shop, or I can put it up higher to keep Mama's coffee out of reach ;)"
Baby,2.0,Adorable but disapointing,Just recieved it today and fell in love with it even more...In the picture provided by amazon it doesn't show just how beautiful the brown is on this cute little monkey...The only thing that is really disappointing is that the pacifier doesn't detach so when its time to replace it I'll have to get rid of the monkey as well :(
Baby,5.0,Great for an Umbrella Stroller,"I use this on my Graco Ipo stroller and works great. It gives me a place to hold a drink,  my keys and cell phone. I am also able to fold the stroller up without removing it. Great product,  I would definitely recommend it."
Baby,4.0,Okay purchase,"I've had this for a long while. Serves its purpose; however, it gets very smushed when you leave it on your umbrella stroller. Just a quick stretch and you can still use the drink slots. Good purchase."
Baby,2.0,Double Dang!,I LOVE that this carries so many wipes. I don't have to remember to refill it after every outing. BUT!!!! the red button falls off or slides open A.L.L the time. Drives me BSC! I've never had my wipes dry out like some reviewers but my wipes does get little ickies from my diaper bag on them since the red button is always sliding around. I WISH I loved this. The concept is great - they need to make the button with a gasket or something to keep it from moving and popping out so easily
Baby,5.0,Great Mobile,My son loves this mobile. He is not easily entertained but is fascinated by this. He enjoys the music and the bright colors.
Baby,1.0,Not worth it for tummy time.,I bought this for my 3 month old to get more tummy time but the &#34;pillow&#34; and I use that loosely is really small!  It barely pushes her up so her face just goes right into the mat.  The ball turns on the part that is turned up but that is it.  Not worth it at all.
Baby,3.0,ok,"it was difficult for me to figure out how to close the red button, until i realised you cant. its a latch that is pushed up. it is ver useful."
Baby,5.0,Works great holding in babies pacifier,I absolutely love this product. It rests right on babies chest or next to his head and helps keep his pacifier in.  I recommend this product to everyone.  I only purchased one but I will soon purchase at least one more..
Baby,5.0,Great!!!,Got a BOB jogging stroller as a gift but it didn't have a cup holder. Since BOB accessories are super expensive (along with their strollers) I decided to look here and found this little caddy. It's perfect and even more perfect for the price! Well made and sturdy. Works just as well if not better than the over priced BOB accessories. Totally happy with this purchase.
Baby,5.0,just what we needed,These caps are always what I lose first when for the bottles.  This 6 pack was much cheaper through this vendor than at walmart or babies r us.
Baby,5.0,Good,The do the job. Great thing to have for capping the bottles to store pumped breast milk or baby food when baby gets older.
Baby,5.0,Does what it is for.,"I wanted the cabs to have a save close for our bottles when traveling. This happend to be the case, what makes this caps the thing I needed and wanted to have."
Baby,5.0,Fits BAgile double perfectly,"This organizer is great.  You can't beat this for the price.  It's super easy to install (velcro) and it holds 2 drinks with plenty of room in the center for other goodies like keys, cell phone etc..  I would highly recommend this."
Baby,5.0,Great Product!,"The kid is entranced! In a good way!<br />This thing dererves all the great reviews it already has.<br />If youre reading this far, you might as well buy it already."
Baby,5.0,Great alternative to the expensive baby jogger brand!,"This fits out City Mini Single Baby Jogger stroller just great.  We're still able to fold the stroller with it attached and it holds 2 cups and has room for a phone, keys, etc.  Highly recommend!"
Baby,2.0,They are too silent,"I found this to be too silent, not &#34;noisy&#34; enough to be a rattle for my taste (and my daugther's). She uses them to suck but when she moves her arms she can't hear them so they don't motivate her to move more."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,"The dragon is super cute very colorful, durable and best of all my baby loves it! :) it has that crunchy sound in a few places, a little mirror on its tail an it's holding a rattle"
Baby,4.0,Wrist rattles,The colouring of these rattles are very nice and quite eye catching. The wings of the butterfly make a nice crinkling sound when touched and it does not take much to get the beetle to rattle. My only complaint is that the label on the betle was appoximately 1 inch in length and was attached to the end of the cloth that wraps around the wrist. As euch it meant that whenever the rattle is worn the label is always sticking out and if baby tries to suck on the beetle the label is immediately thrust into her face. I ended up cutting off mine and i find it to be a lack of fore thought on the design team's behalf
Baby,5.0,Great gift for my niece!,It's great! I love it! My niece loves it! Her parents love it! All my family love it! It's great for kids!
Baby,5.0,Great baby monitor,"I got this for my daughter who just had a baby......it's amazing.....sound is great, picture is really clear.... It gives them total piece of mind.....awesome!!!"
Baby,5.0,Great product!,Easy slide for access of wipes<br />Can contain a good amount of wipes<br />Wipes stay wet/ doesn't dry out<br />Overall a great product..
Baby,1.0,Not recommended.,The wood broke within 5 minutes of use. So disappointed! It didn't take much to break. I would not recommend this product.
Baby,4.0,3 month old likes it,My son got this as a gift and likes it so far. We have only had it a few days but it keeps holding his attention. I asked for this one because we have been using the captain on his play mat for a while but wanted one to hold in his hands instead of dangle. Only issue with it is the squeaker is hard to squeeze so he won't be able to use it till he is much older. I did find it funny that amazon has a warning on this toy for 3+ years old though.
Baby,5.0,Holds baby's attention!,"My 3 month old loves his new Sir Prance A Lot. The colors and sounds it makes fascinate him. As always, Lamaze products are well made and easy to clean."
Baby,4.0,Good for infants!,Great for newborns. I only wish you were able to unattach the pacifier from the monkey so it could be cleaned easier.
Baby,5.0,Withings,"Good stuff. Only recommendation would be to use my playlist on my phone for music. Also, too much feedback when you are close to the device."
Baby,5.0,Perfect...!!!,"serves me what I need and fits almost any type of towels that I purchased in the market, the quallity is great"
Baby,5.0,Can't do without it.,My daughter loves her rainforest friends.  The music is wonderful and the toys are so bright in color and cute to look at.  Even visiting babies love staring at it and are fascinated by it.
Baby,5.0,Works like a charm,"Easy set up and my baby loves it. I do wish it had more songs to chose from, but still a good product."
Baby,5.0,Great camera...easy set up...nice piece of mind,"This camera took 5min to link to my wifi and I was using it on my iPad and wife's iPhone just as fast...the night vision is good and easy to maneuver the camera, the sound isn't very loud but it picks up a lot ....really a great device to make you feel better an not have ya jumping out of bed every 10min...perfect for new parents who worry like I did with my first"
Baby,5.0,Great Baby Toy,My grandson is 3 months old and just loves this.  Out of the many toys we got for his car seat this is the one that he likes the best!
Baby,4.0,Works Great!!,Honestly not sure what all of these complaints are about.  I have had this almost 9 months after getting it as a gift an it's been great!  Contrary to some rumors it DOES work over 3G in fact it warns you the connection may be slower since your not on local network.<br />My unit has worked like a charm and the infrared is phenomenal.  No complaints here.
Baby,5.0,work well,They do what is intended and it's nice to have spares around the house just in case one is lost.
Baby,4.0,The product works ok for my baby needs,"I got the product in the right time and works very nice, besides my baby loves it. Actually the pictures of the item looks like the original"
Baby,5.0,"Super handy, easy to set up.","Great device that sets up in a snap.  If your wifi crashes that's fine you can still monitor in the household via the bluetooth connection.  I've noticed a slight delay in the video transmission over the wifi but it is inconsequential for the baby monitoring purpose.  Also, the lullaby feature and the rainbow night light really does help put our baby to sleep.  This is also nice because you can move it from room to room, or travel with it should you need to.  Great product from WIthings."
Baby,5.0,My 4 month old can't get enough of these!,"I bought these for my 4 month old son for Christmas and he LOVES them! They keep him entertained for hours at a time and doesn't irritate his delicate skin! I love the fact that he can hear them rattle, but it's soft enough to where it doesn't annoy me or my husband! Very satisfied with my purchase!"
Baby,4.0,Works great,"This stroller caddy works great!  I have a baby jogger stroller and I didn't want to pay another 20 dollars for the stroller caddy.  I found this one on amazon and I have been satisfied with it for past 2 years.  It holds two drinks my cell phone a snack, and keys.  There even is a zipper pocket for things you need to secure."
Baby,5.0,Great for Preemies!,This is great pacifier for little ones who are still building their strength. The animal helps keep the pacifier in their mouth while giving them something to grab.
Baby,5.0,monkey pacifier,so cute will occupy him while soothing him goes with all the other awesome things I have purchase from amazon.
Baby,4.0,Good infant toy,"Like al lthe Lamaze early development toys, Sir Prance a Lot is a favorite with my 4 month old grandson."
Baby,5.0,Fun toy,Adorabel Lamaze toy. We love this brand and its different toys and this plush toy is so cute and has lots of little extras. Deffinetly would recommend it to friends with babies/ toddlers.
Baby,5.0,my newborn nephew just loves it,"I gave this to my newborn nephew since his mom was always losing his pacifier, now its always there to be found"
Baby,5.0,Great Product,"My baby enjoys this Mobile, keeps him quiet at day, and at night with the noise maker option, was sure worth the $40.00<br /><br />ah, my wife enjoys it too, so she can do some house work while the baby is quiet..."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!  Very smart invention!!!!,Fantastic for babies to hold onto while they suck on the pacifier!  Helps the baby to keep it in place because the monkey acts as a holder.
Baby,5.0,great electronic for looking up your newborn,"We have a big house and were concerned regarding our newborn safety. We tested it several times with n-class WIFI and it really works as advertised. One of the best around, its pricey but good. We had parties on the first floor but new instantly if our son was making noises while sleeping or was awake...<br /><br />A good buy..."
Baby,3.0,Does the job but could be better,"The animas are cute, a child can easily press the buttons, it has a night light feature, and it plays music. It spins but it's so slow moving that its almost not worth it. The songs/sounds could be better but if you're not looking for anything fancy, this is great."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic!,This product exceeded all our expectations.  Does everything as described and then some.  Movement of leaves is just unbelievable.  Music is perfect and volume control perfect also.  Would recommend this for all babies.  Remote control is wonderful bonus!
Baby,4.0,Good Quality,the quality of the cam is good.<br />wireless is fine and no disconnection<br />controlling the cam through the iphone is a piece of cake<br />no complicated software & no installation complications.<br />the only missing thing is there is NO (Zoom-in and zoom-out) option but still the device worth it.
Baby,5.0,Love it,My 3 month old got it for Christmas and loves it.  The colors are great and he enjoys grabbing the rings on the tail and the crinkly feet.  We also got the soft cloth book that goes with it and he loves both of them.
Baby,4.0,Excellent Mobile,"We purchased this mobile to match other Fisher Price Rainforest line items. Great mobile - adorable, good selection of music. We appreciate the handheld remote to turn it off / on. Easy to attach to crib side."
Baby,4.0,Works well,"I use this for Uppababy G-luxe.  It works pretty well and doesn't need to be removed to be folded...so I thought.  I should've left it bit loser because one of the wire is poking out due to being pull in too tight when folded.  It still works.  I have losened it bit more but it swings bit more so I won't put something like hot coffee with opening in it since it'll spill.  Good to put water bottles, keys, sunglasses, food, etc.  I'd probably buy it again."
Baby,5.0,WubbaLove!,"My friend suggested this little dude and I was hesitant to purchase it after my dismay with a similar binky holder for the Tommee Tippees, but this guy is great!<br />After watching her daughter with hers I thought I would give it a try and I am so happy I did. My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest.<br /><br />I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth.<br /><br />The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached. You cannot remove the binkie, but you can easily clean it with the monkey attached.<br /><br />I will purchase this for many a baby shower coming up as it has been a great item to have."
Baby,5.0,cute,these are very cute. a good idea before they are able to grip for themselves. the rattle is very slight. almost too quiet.
Baby,5.0,Exactly what we wanted!!,"This is an amazing product. I have to admit I was dubious after reading so many of the reviews that said this didn't work well, and all I can say is I was amazed at how easy it was to set up. I followed the recommendations from other reviews that said \\""make sure you read the manual\\"". I hooked up the monitor to our router box and within 5 minutes it was working!! (and this coming from someone who generally doesn't do well with electronics!!)  The hardest part for me was setting it up so that I can view the video from outside our house. Not only can I check in on my baby (and my dog!!) where-ever I am (work, grocery store etc) but my family overseas can also see baby from Europe - and for my mom, being able to see her first grandchild from thousands of miles away has just made her year!!! Using the app to view on the ipad/iphone really makes it so easy and user friendly. Me and my husband highly recommend this product for anyone who's looking for a video monitor for their baby. You can add multiple cameras and the sound quality is also great!!! Highly highly recommend this! :-)"
Baby,1.0,A promising product ended up a total dissapointment,"I was in love with this monitor at first, in spite of the incredibly obnoxious alert sound that you cannot change, and the over sensitive alerts that went off if so much as shut our front door. I liked the idea, and being able to peek in on our daughter from anywhere.<br /><br />After a month of use, the thing is a nightmare. Since the app update, the alerts are unchangeable- trying to open them causes the app to crash immediately, and the app store is filled with people with the same problem.<br /><br />Occasionally, my camera would not work and I would have to hit the search button once, maybe twice. Now it does not work at all, AFTER LESS THAN TWO MONTHS OF USE!<br /><br />Please don't waste your money, and find another, more reliable monitor."
Baby,4.0,Favorite product ever!!!,"Not only can I open and pull out a wipe with one hand, it's durable and clips to the inside of my bag. It also holds quite a few wipes."
Baby,4.0,Cute,"My granddaughter loved it. She took them everywhere at xmas day. They will be great companion very soon, when autumn comes."
Baby,5.0,lamaze high  contrast wrist rattles,my daughter loved the rattles for connor it was brigh a will help him find his hands and feet  was perfect for what i wanted
Baby,5.0,fun for everyone,"My daughter is 5 months old and we got her this for Christmas. She loves the bright colours, the crinkly wings and the mirror on the end of the tail. There are also multiple things for chewing on when she's teething and different textures for her to explore.<br />Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming, and she wants something simpler, but I love everything Lamaze produces. We got Dee Dee the Dragon because our girl was born in the Year of the Dragon. She also got Emily the little girl doll from an aunt."
Baby,4.0,"Fits on the babyjogger, good product","This is a great cupholder, has room to hold snacks and keys and can also handle small thermos. I got it after I purchased my city select and wish I had included it on my registry."
Baby,3.0,small size,"They are good, but you can use just for a short period... By 6 M it does not fit confortable."
Baby,4.0,An Air Travel Must Have,We just got back from a Christmas trip across the country with our four month old twins.  It was hard to find small toys that were plane friendly & could not be thrown. These rattles were perfect!  They kept our little ones fascinated for hours.
Baby,5.0,love it!,"this pacifier has truly saved my life! my daughter loves that there is something to play with for extra comfort, and I love how much easier it is to find around the house. the reason I bought it was because of the fact that my daughter wakes up looking for her pacifier. with the extra weight, it stays in her mouth better and she gets a better night sleep. I would recommend this to anyone!"
Baby,5.0,good material,I was a little leary of the quality of material after looking at a $12 similar item in a local baby store.  This product is cheaper and much nicer and sturdier.
Baby,5.0,My Daughter's Favorite toy,"We recieved so many gifts with the birth of our first daughter, and many were toys. Well, this one bet them all! My daughter is 9 months and this is still one of only two toys that can make her stop crying in an instant and smile. (The other \\""toy\\"" that can do this, oddly enough, is the stapula from the baby bullet. Its small and perfectly fits in her hand. She loves to weild that thing around and hit all sorts of things to listen to the different sounds. Ha!)<br />Bottom line: this toy is so good I am buying a second one in case, *gasp*, she ever loses it!"
Baby,5.0,Must have,I bought this one and the lamb for my twins and I love them. Their easy to find when dropped in the car seat and great when their swaddled at night. They are also good when they are on the swing. If they fall out when they are sleeping they don't go far and you can always find them.
Baby,5.0,Little one loves it!!,"My son loves this, it's his favorite pacifier! I will be buying more of these. Everyone that sees it thinks it's so cute!!"
Baby,3.0,Wrist rattle,. Didn't hold interest for long; baby was not aware it was there after awhile. Probably good for 3-4 month old.
Baby,5.0,Loves it!,"My granddaughter who is 6 1/2 moths old , loves this thing! Especially in the car hanging from her car seat!"
Baby,4.0,it's good,"it's a good stuff to put on the handles, but I wish it had a cover attached to it, so that when we don't use it, we can cover it to avoid dust."
Baby,5.0,Great little holder,I've used this a ton and it has held up pretty well. It's nice and sturdy and fits well on our stroller. We have an Aprica Presto.
Baby,5.0,Good although i agree light weight,"I got the little blue monkey. At first I thought it was too lightweight as I used to put it on my baby's chest while lying flat on his back, but it kept on falling off. Then one day by chance my baby's face was tilted to the side and the monkey fell on one side and found out that that way it works better! Basically when baby's face is on the side while lying in bed you just put the monkey lying close to him (not parallel) putting the paci in baby's mouth, The paci stayed in his mouth and even if it came out my baby was able to pull it back in most of the times. I still would have preferred it if the hands and feet were slightly heavier."
Baby,3.0,"Great baby toy, but one big issue...","Our daughter loves Dee Dee. The crinkle wings and mirror tail keep baby entertained. Also, the attachment ring is great for connecting to plastic rings to use when out with baby.<br /><br />I did have one big issue however. The rattle that is attached to the dragon's right hand is made of rather hard plastic. Also, (as you can see in the pictures) the edges of the rattle are dull, but mirror a 'spiked' rattle. My biggest worry was that like most babies, my daughter would grab this toy and swing it back and forth as she plays and perhaps hit herself in the eye/face/head. I can tell you that the plastic rattle ball attached to Dee Dee is hard enough that if that happened it would definitely leave a mark and cause some tears. I was concerned enough that I actually cut the string attaching the rattle portion to Dee Dee to avoid any possible self inflicted injuries."
Baby,5.0,Cute and Fun,"My 4 month old daughter loves her feet, so these foot rattles make playing with her feet even more exciting.  They fall off easily, but so do all of her socks.  All in all, I would buy more for her and as for gifts."
Baby,2.0,Doesn't fit the crib and freezes,"I was excited to receive this mobile.  My ds wouldn't sleep in his crib, and after reading the reviews I thought- this is it, lull him to sleep with this entrancing mobile.  I took it out of the package and quickly ran upstairs to attach it to the crib.  Unfortunately, it only fits in one direction, and because our crib is curvy and thick- and wasn't going to work.  But, I was desperate- &#34;this was it&#34; I needed my ds to sleep!  So... we crafted up a stand with 4x4's and up went the mobile (slightly tacky but for a good cause).  At first ds didn't care for it, the light was too bright for nigh time.  However, I worked it into the routine before bed.  Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.  Until the next night, yup- frozen again.  I guess the leaves are just to heavy to play peek-a-boo every night.  I purchased this mobile when my son was 3 months, he was 6 months when the mobile started freezing on us."
Baby,1.0,Extremely disappointed :(,"I was desperately looking for solution to the pacifier always falling out of my 2 month old baby's mouth making him cry hysterically particularly when I'm driving. I read reviews and thought this product would be a lifesaver but I was so disappointed. First, the pacifier that comes with the toy is flimsy, it's not the same quality as the actually one that you buy separately. Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy. I waited by the door to receive this and unfortunately it was a huge waste. Going back to holding the pacifier in myself."
Baby,5.0,Baby loved it.,So did we. Cutest thing ever. We kept it in the car and baby loved to play with it on car trips. Well made.
Baby,5.0,So excited about this amazing toy!,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail! It arrived faster than I'd expected, and was packaged in an extra plastic bag. It's better than I'd imagined! Even though my little one hasn't yet arrived, I know she'll love it! It is a little bit bigger than I'd thought, but it's actually a perfect size! I can't wait to see my little one's face when she plays with it. It's truly adorable!"
Baby,3.0,Nice product -really poor customer service,"I finally have this camera up and running and so far I'm happy with how it is functioning, but it has taken me over a week to get the camera set up.  The only way I found to contact the company was to e-mail.  I never heard back from the company for product support and ended up fiddling with the camera for ages and searching the net for answers before getting it working.  The batter it comes with does not hold a charge and I'm in the process of figuring out how to contact the company for a replacement.  On the other hand I'm really excited that I can view the camera picture from anywhere :)"
Baby,5.0,simple design and great functionality,"i have two of these, one for the car and one for the diaper bag/stroller. i love the simple design. it is easy to open and close with one hand (a must!) and it keeps a good amount of wipes fresh for a long time. the strap is a lifesaver since i am always digging in my bags for stuff!"
Baby,5.0,recommend,"product as expected, bought as a gift and loved it presented. great for kids, great durability and good for the day dia.indico this product"
Baby,5.0,Love!,"Adorable. My daughter loves these its like entertainment and a pacifier. Its easy for her to se and grab when she wakes up in the middle of the night. I adore these. I have the frog,duck,big red dog and now monkey. Worth every penny."
Baby,4.0,Bright and attention-grabbing - Sized Small,"Bought for my 4-month-old.  They are a little snug on her feet already, but she still likes to grab and shake them."
Baby,5.0,Awesome add-on that fits many different strollers,"This has been a great addition to our strollers. It's easy to take on and off, and depending on the type of stroller you have, you might be able to keep it on when you fold it up. As other reviewers say, the organizer does get a little deformed if you aren't super careful with it, but that doesn't effect the purpose it serves. It's easy to bend the wire back to where it belongs if it gets a little crooked."
Baby,5.0,Sir Prance A Lot,my granddaughter absolutely loves her sir prance a lot. the quality of this item was wonderful. I would recommend this purchase
Baby,3.0,Functional,"Its been fine for me, but both my husband and mother did not find this product intuitive. They ripped the red piece off to get to the wipes.  All you have to do it slide it, however that mechanism can be a little tough at times"
Baby,1.0,Wipes dry out and too bulky!,"This case is best kept attached to a stoller for one day's use.  It is too bulky to carry around in a bag.  Plus if you leave wipes in it for more than a day, they dry out."
Baby,5.0,Excelente,"Muy buen producto, total satisfaccion y seguridad para el cuidado del bebe.<br />Excelente. Gracias por crear cosas tan útiles para el bienestar"
Baby,5.0,"Awesome Monitor, Awesome Company!","This monitor is so easy to use with the WithBaby app! I haven't had a single problem with the product. It is easy to see and hear through my iPhone. Since the baby isn't due for a few months we use it as a security camera for now. We also set it up in the bedroom to check the humidity level.<br /><br />When I received this item it had been used already and I learned shortly thereafter that the battery would not hold a charge. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent me a replacement batter. It was so easy! I was so impressed by how responsive and helpful they were!<br /><br />The one downside of the current app is that there is no easy way to add additional users. The company says this is because they have not programmed any permissions thus it is unnecessary and you can just share your credentials with others to give them access. That doesn't work for me simply because I don't like having community passwords. However, you can easily add additional users by uninstalling the app and creating a different account when setting up the app again. Granted, I had to do this two times in order to first add my husband and then add my mother but it wasn't a painful process.<br /><br />This is absolutely the best monitor I have seen on the market. You won't be disappointed!"
Baby,3.0,OK but wire pops out,"This organizer does what it's intended to do, but the quality is not very good.  After a few uses, the metal wire frame popped out of the material and now it's useless.  Would not recommend."
Baby,5.0,:D,i love this prodct! i accidently ordered this but my little boy just loves it n sleeps with it every night
Baby,4.0,Great add on,"It was a great add on to the stroller. Easy to install, price was reasonable too. We are happy that we have it"
Baby,1.0,first time to review a product,"don't know why these new things can get so many scratches. I replaced this once, but the situation is not much better. I do not plan to replace or return again, but just let others know: do not expect a totally new tool from here."
Baby,1.0,Not Star Worthy! The worst mobile EVER!,"This is by far the WORST crib mobile I have ever had! (As a NICU RN I have worked with many babies who had crib mobiles.) This is my 2nd mobile of this make and model. The 1st, and now the 2nd, do not work! I followed the directions to the 'T'...and the music sounds as if it is dying...and the motor worked for all of 2 seconds (with both #1 and #2)! Now on my 2nd mobile (bc I returned the 1st)...and this mobile does not even work..AT ALL! Brand new batteries...and the mobile will not function! No music! No motor function! The same batteries work in the cradle swing... I am sending this mobile back and never purchasing another product from Fisher-Price! My daughter is 3 months old and we are on our 2nd FP cradle swing...and 2 mobiles later... I am D O N E with FP! FP needs to improve on product quality...to say the least!!!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Being a modern parent I wanted a little more than just an audio monitor, friends have one of these and recommended it to us, after messing around with a standard IP Camera (which turns out was a cheap knock off) I decided to give this one a try and have not looked back since.  The night vision mode is brilliant and really clear.  One thing I would love to be added is a mac app, they have windows and iOS but no OSX"
Baby,5.0,Musical Mobile,"This is GREAT!  The combination of bright colors, music, and lights really entertains the baby!  It is obvious she LOVES it, and anything she loves, we love.  It is difficult to find a mobile that is geared to the baby's vision, with bright colors the baby can actually see!  Pastels can't be seen by babies until they are much older.  I HIGHLY recommend this mobile!"
Baby,5.0,Loved as a gift,"I bought this for a friend's shower and she absolutely loves it. It looks good, sounds good, and the baby loves it."
Baby,5.0,Great Toy at a Great Price,"~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased this toy for my 2 month old son to entertain him and aid in his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Bright, bold, contrasting colors.<br />- Each leg on the giraffe has a different stimulator - mirror, rattle, teether and beads.<br />- Different textures on the giraffe.<br />- Velcro loop/strap on top makes it easy to attach to many places - strollers, carriers, cribs, activity mats, etc.<br />- Can be used independently without attaching simply as a toy.<br />- Good price.  Comparably priced toys in local stores are much less entertaining.<br />- Appears to be well made.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- None so far!<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- When washing this or any other baby toy I strongly recommend using a baby-specific laundry detergent such as [[ASIN:B004HCUMAA Dreft Baby Laundry Detergent Liquid, 32 Loads, 50-Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B005W2MVJ4 Dapple Fragrance-Free Baby Laundry Detergent 2x - 50 oz]].<br />- Keep an eye on the small mirror.  As your baby gets older and stronger and the more the toy gets used and washed, he/she may be able to dislodge the mirror which can obviously be a hazard.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />Overall I am very pleased with this toy.  It is definitely one of the better values and interesting toys we have purchased."
Baby,4.0,Great Concept - Will be Hit or Miss w/ Your Baby,"~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased the same ones, but different colors and part of a set - [[ASIN:B000I2Q0C2 Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle & Foot Finder Set]] for my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.<br />- Wrist rattles can be used for more than just the wrist - they can be attached to carriers, playpads, etc.<br />- Works as a chewing toy.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- The wrist rattle cuffs are a bit on the small side.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />Similar to other reviews on Amazon regarding the Lamaze wrist and foot rattles,  my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles. This is strange because he loved looking at and touching similar looking toys. But he does enjoy chewing on the wrist rattles - I just wash them every few days.<br /><br />Definitely stay away from the [[ASIN:B004BSFC6Y Lamaze High Contrast Foot Finders]] as they are designed very poorly."
Baby,1.0,"Great Concept, But Many Flaws","~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased the set that includes these foot rattles, but in different colors - [[ASIN:B000I2Q0C2 Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle & Foot Finder Set]] for my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- Foot rattles are hard to put on initially and then remain stretched out and too big.<br />- Foot rattles are not designed like a sock with a curve to them. The are merely tubes of fabric. Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?<br />- Foot rattles keep coming off. There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down. Even over socks they just keep sliding down. When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.<br />- Rattles are a bit too quiet.<br />- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />I think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles. This is strange because he loves looking at and touching similar looking toys.<br /><br />I would not recommend these and would recommend spending your money on something else."
Baby,3.0,Don't work as well with Avent Natural Bottles,"While these discs will still fit on the top of an Avent Natural bottle and hold a seal, they don't fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with Avent Classic bottles. So milk won't leak or spill, but when you unscrew the ring, you have two pieces to mess with. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a sealing disc for the Natural bottles- hopefully they're coming soon!<br /><br />UPDATE: I did, however, learn that the rings for [[ASIN:B000EH2I18 Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Screw Rings, 4-Pack]] fit on Avent natural bottles, so I just ordered some rings and now the seal fits nicely in the ring on my Natural bottles!!"
Baby,5.0,Very nice!,"Simple, nice sized, and not hard at all to put together. I received this two days after ordering, far before the delivery date! Bought as a Christmas present for my four month old brother and he absolutely loves it! He is just filled with smiles and giggles :) it's a pleasant interactive toy"
Baby,4.0,Baby loved them!,"My baby's attention was really captured by this product!  He loved these, but sadly he is a big guy and outgrew them very quickly.  He still like to play with them, but we cannot attach them to his chunky wrists."
Baby,5.0,Great toy for a developing baby...,My 6 month old daughter loves this toy. It provides great stimulation for a little one. She loves the crinkly wings and the mirror on the end of the tail.
Baby,5.0,best thing you could ever buy..,"it took a few trys but once my baby took to it, it was a life saver. i bought a second one for the living room."
Baby,5.0,Bought this sight unseen as a gift.,"Bought this sight unseen as a gift for my 3 month old baby nephew. He loves it! It was apparently easy for my sis to put together, she sent pictures and it looks and from what I hear it sounds great, too. Has kept the baby quiet and soothed him to sleep on countless nights. Worth it for new parents!"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,"We just got this the other day and my son is mesmerized by it.  he's 2 months old and loves to watch his little buddies spin around.  my only complaint is that while it plays for about 20 minutes it plays the same song over and over again.  It doesn't seem to bother the baby though.<br /><br />Update:  We've had this for a few days now and I love it even more.  My son isn't much of a self soother, needed to be held and rocked to sleep then I could never put him down without waking him up.  This mobile keeps him happy and quiet long enough for him to fall asleep on his own in his crib!  That alone is worth its weight in gold to me!"
Baby,4.0,My son loves it.,"While this fails to put my son to sleep, that doesn't mean he doesn't freaking love it. He likes to watch it move and \\""talk\\"" to it. It's not overly stimulating though. He is very relaxed he just doesn't sleep. He loves for us to change his diaper in the crib so he can watch it go.<br /><br />The mobile came with a slight defect on the \\""arm\\"". This in no way hindered the functionality of the mobile. It appears as though there was a rough part on the metal and the paint didn't go on smoothly because of it. Posted a picture.<br /><br />[...]"
Baby,5.0,Third time is a charm!,"As noted above, this is our third monitor (mobi cam & baby ping were returned). All of the glittery features of the Withings monitor are on par & function effortlessly with our iPhones & iPads. The video/audio has a 1/2-1 second delay but its rather unnoticeable. We live in a high rise so you can imagine the interference one could expect yet this monitor performed beautifully when I tested it out 9 floors up at another mums house. She loved it too! Looking forward to the security and flexibility of the Withings monitor once our baby is born...I promise, you won't be disappointed either."
Baby,5.0,Our favorite toy!,"We got this as a baby shower gift for my second son. It was a clear winner from the very beginning, having to compete with many new and even more old similar toys (inherited by his older brother). This is the only one that would keep him engaged in his crib, so much that he'd eventually doze off and sleep (what a bliss!)<br /><br />The giraffe is the only baby toy I still have hanging from his crib now that he's turning one, and he occasionally stil plays with it. Highly recommended!!!"
Baby,5.0,I like this product its perfect,I recomend this product i like and works fine .I like this product work very good and i recomend other persons. Shipping in time nice exelent. The product came in good conditions
Baby,5.0,nice accessory,"We bought this for our Aprica Presto and it fits perfectly. It also folds relatively flat, if you need it to."
Baby,1.0,Don't bother,"Don't bother with these.  I thought they'd be great for my grandson since he was dropping everthing you put in his hands, but you can't even hear the rattle and neither did he.  Was a waste of money."
Baby,5.0,"fantastic product, a must for all parents","i would recommend this product to parents of young babies.<br /><br />bought this to replace a samsung baby monitor that i had for 9 months after my curious and active baby decided to break the old one.  the samsung one was actually a pretty good product, but with smartphones all around the house, i think the video unit for the baby monitor is rather obsolete.  i saw this product a while back, but since there isn't a need for it then, i bought two when i realised that the old one need to be replaced.<br /><br />this product is very good, and the connection is extremely simple to set up.  i order this from amazon, and it arrives in HK in the 3rd day, which i much quicker than for me to go to the shops to get it.  once delivered, my wife set this up with ease and inform me to view the baby together on the account she set up.<br /><br />the video is clear (though the refresh rate can be improved), and there are plenty of features to play with - e.g., the music function does actually provide music, not just noise pretending to be songs, and the good thing is that this can transmit video and sound via bluetooth, wifi, indoors, outdoors, etc.<br /><br />i have one in the bedroom and one in the lounge, and this pretty much covers all activity areas that the baby has, and i can give instructions to the maid at home via my phone, so, this is extremely handy if i see something not right."
Baby,5.0,Adorable,Purchased this for my granddaughter because she was born in the year of the dragon.  It's cute and she loves it!
Baby,4.0,Almost perfect,"My son loves it, I love it. I can attach it to his stroller, car seat, playmat and bouncer. The colors are vibrant and will have even me staring at it sometimes. I just wish it didn't attract so much lint."
Baby,1.0,Not for Big Houses,I am so sad that this monitor didn't work for me. We have a large house (5000 sq/ft) and the nursery is upstairs. I tried countless times to get this to sync up to our home wireless network and it always disconnected after a few minutes. I wanted to use this so I even upgraded my cable modem and got a new router as well. Nada. I couldn't even get it to work in the same room as the router let alone upstairs in the baby's room. It worked great when it was connected to the router with a ethernet cable but wirelessly this thing is horrible.
Baby,4.0,So for 3 so far... so good..,"Been eyeing on this device for quite sometime...and didn't think I needed it until we moved to a big house. And with 3 under 5s and one on the way, well I think all that nagging to hubby was worth it. Took me less than 10 minutes to set up. I'm not a tech geek, and the manual was more or less straight forward except it didn't tell me how long the monitor can be used for without plugging in or how long u had to charge it for, until I read a review here.<br />I paired it up bluetooth and wireless, then the first thing I did was took a picture and text it to DH. Great quality. My two have been going in n out of their rooms when it's bed time. Not tonight they didn't! They loved the rainbow colours, the 7 lullabys (so far) and they get to hear my voice when they call me. The delay in sound is about 1/2secs but that's expected! I get the alert messages almost immediately too.<br />Only thing is the night vision seems a little on the white side so that needs improving. Also I wish it was a bit more cheaper so I can get a second one. Maybe they should do a deal for two purchase for the price of one?!<br />We had a baby monitor 5 years ago and hardly used it plus the fact there was the extra black n white monitor that needed batteries and had to be carried around. Now its just my iPhone and the sleek boxed camera in a handy bag! no fuss with endless wires, plugs, antenna,batteries and what have u to assemble!<br />Overall I can't wait for the next addition to arrive so I can test it on him! But with 3 already it's perfect especially now as I can really see the mischief they get up too! Lol..."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,We could not have picked a better pacifier for my granddaughter.  She no longer cries excessively because of her spitting out the pacifier.  It was the best thing I have purchased for her yet.
Baby,1.0,This is the worst investment EVER!,"Ibaby should actually be recalled and removed from the shelves because it does not work. If you're aiming to view your baby from outside the home, DO NOT buy this item as it will NEVER work. It is a huge pain to set up and the reward is ZERO as it crashes constantly. If you think you'll be able to watch your baby from your iphone, you're WRONG. Great in theory, but worthless in reality."
Baby,5.0,love,kids love it and came so fast.<br /> but wish you can take the pacific out and put in more so i can wash it better
Baby,3.0,Straps are short,"Quality is good.  Great to have for babies who can't hold onto things yet.  However, the straps are a bit short, and may not fit bigger babies.  Mine is only 11 lbs right now and he has almost outgrown these.  Also, my baby never really showed much interest in these.  But that may just be my baby."
Baby,5.0,"Love, Love, Love it!","Love, Love, Love it.  My grandson can hold and manoever his pacifier, which in turn keeps him soothed much longer."
Baby,5.0,perfect mobile,"We bought this mobile for our 9-week old daughter, and she loves watching it. The outer leaves that open and close around the animals on the inner leaves is an excellent feature. I was worried that the plush animals would look cheap, but they are very cute, especially the frog and monkey. The music options are all great and not annoying like some baby toys. As for battery life, we have used the mobile at least once every day for 3 weeks and no sign of needing to change them. This mobile may not be a good choice if you are looking for a sleeping aid- we use it during wake time because it has quite the opposite effect on our daughter. Overall, one of our best baby purchases and definitely worth the $29 we paid for it on Amazon."
Baby,5.0,Works great for me!,"I think this case works really well. Unlike some of the other reviewers, it's been easy to slide the red button and grab a wipe (or two, or three, or four:) with one hand. All types of wipes work well with it. The size wasn't an issue for me - it lives in my diaper bag and I like that it's able to hold a lot of wipes - less chance of me becoming wipes-less in a time of need!"
Baby,3.0,Leaves and Animals Don't Move,After putting fresh batteries in this mobile the leaves and animals don't spin and move as described.  We may have a bad unit as we can &#34;help&#34; it along with a tap of our finger but that is weak.  Even though it doesn't move it has enough wow or busy-ness for our 4 month old to enjoy looking at it.
Baby,5.0,Great wipes case!,I have had this wipes case since my 3 year old was a baby(am getting ready to use it for my 3rd child!)! I agree with the previous reviewer! I have had no trouble opening this case! You kinda have to push the button down and then slide it open! I can do this easily one handed! The case holds a lot of wipes and I haven't had trouble with them drying out either! It snaps shut securely and keeps the wipes moist! I kept it in my diaper bag when my 3 year old was in diapers and it served me well! Will definitely be a diaper bag staple for this baby as well! My case is 3 years old and it is still in great condition! It is a durable wipes case that functions as it should! Love it!
Baby,5.0,An extra space for the stroller!,"i am a baby and a toddler mom, me and my husband always need hands free! This is an extra holder for the stroller, fits perfect and safe! The zipper is the plus! Love it!"
Baby,5.0,Grandson loves his monkey bink,Bought this for my newborn grandson and he loves it! I had to buy a second one because he throws a fit when his mom takes it to make sure it's kept clean!
Baby,5.0,Perfect fit for Chicco Liteway Stroller,"If you have a Chicco Liteway Stroller...this is the organizer you need.  If fits perfectly, looks like it was part of the stroller, and the best part is that you do not have to remove it when you fold your Chicco Liteway Stroller.  :)"
Baby,5.0,Very good,"wonderfull, iam loved this product and arrived my home quick, i am hope buy more things in future, thanks.<br />I am will buy more"
Baby,5.0,My newborn baby really love it,It's very nice that my newborn baby look the colorful animals. The melodies are soft with excellent sound. I love the colorful animals to.
Baby,5.0,Why did I wait so long?,"This is great,so handy, and works so well! I have no idea why I waited so long to get something like this. First, the price can't be beat, and second it holds two cups (insulated), a small pocket for keys and a wallet and a larger compartment for gloves, phone, extra snacks.... It doesn't get I'm the way of my hands or the hand brake. Great job!<br /><br />I should mention that I have a Baby Jogger Summit XC."
Baby,5.0,Best Pacifier,"Our kids love it, it is a crazy situation with it they love the monkey pacifier. Good product and beatiful desing"
Baby,5.0,Nephew loves it !!!,"I purchased this for my 3 1/2 - 4 month old nephew this past Christmas, and I have to say that he absolutely loves it. I'm not to sure what it is about it but it grabs his attention and puts a smile on his precious little face.  I will forever remember the look on his face as his eyes opened with excitement as he kicked, waved with a big smile as we handed him the gift. Great purchase."
Baby,5.0,I love it!!,"We got this for our baby girl who is due in March, and I've been trying it out in my 5 up son's room... It works amazingly! Love the video quality, all the options, being able to talk, setting what temp alerts and humidity alerts I want, and being able to check in whole I'm at work! This is well worth every penny! I'm very happy with my decision to go with Withings!!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome,Great product.  Very eye appealing.  The baby loves playing with it and discovering the different textures.  Would highly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,great for getting attention!,"i put these around my 4-month old granddaughter's wrists or ankles and it brings her attention to it.  so much fun to watch her reach for it, whether it's on her wrist or &#34;far away&#34; on her ankle.  they are a great size, not too big, easy to use, have a pleasant rattle and crackly sounds."
Baby,5.0,Love the slim design and capacity,We have a 6 week old newborn and this wipes case has been perfect for our use. The slim design makes this easy to store in our diaper bag and it holds plenty of wipes for our needs.
Baby,5.0,Works perfectly for me.,"Bought this to go on my new Britax B-Agile stroller (which I purchased in Red and also LOVE) and it works perfectly.  The only thing that I am no so fond of is the drink holder and getting my hot beveredge in and out of it as it is a bit ackward and always afraid I might spill it.  Good for water and drink bottles though.  If you want a holder for hot beveredges, I suggest getting a separate cup holder."
Baby,4.0,Cute but wish they were louder,"These are very cute, and the colors are very eye catching for baby; she loves to look at them, however, I wish they were a little louder so they kept her attention for a bit more time"
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Love this! Great for make sure u don't lose it. Good for when the baby starts to grab for things.
Baby,5.0,perfect,"my stroller does not have a parent tray so I was looking for something that would substitute. Holds my drinks, snacks, and whatnot perfectly."
Baby,5.0,For my son,My 8 month year old son loves this thing. It's one of his favorite toys and it has a lot of little things that make sounds he likes. It's very soft and doesn't have anything that he might swallow or poke himself with.
Baby,2.0,Baby Monitor for iOS systems,"We decided to purchase this baby monitor hoping it is compatible with our Apple products.  However, after testing it, it was not what we expected.  The picture quality was very grainy, and the would not always connect.  Needed to reboot/reset the system everytime the camera was turned on."
Baby,5.0,Lamaze foot finders,"Adorable, wonderful for new born babies!  Babies love to look at their feel and the lady bug and butterfly are adorable."
Baby,5.0,Lamaze wrist rattles,"Wrist rattles, what could be better.  So cute and colorful, baby will love it!  Again I love the butterfly and lady bug."
Baby,5.0,perfect for baby,"this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, not only does it work but my 9 week old just loves it and can hold it on his chest at night and doe not loose it, when it does finally fall out it stays right next to him so he does not awake because he feels it fall.  just love love love it........"
Baby,4.0,Great camera!,This product is great! Once set up properly. It only comes with the basic directions to set up wifi to use in your home. But after doing some research and googling I found a site that had directions for setting it up to view outside of my home with my iphone. It does have a little bit of a delay using it on 3g but nothing to get worked up about. I did read some people say that it is not possible to use on 3g or outside of the house but I wouldn't give up. The trick is to have the camera connected directly to the router and then to port forward. You find the detailed step by step directions to do this at ibabylabs.com. Don't return this product or allow all the negative feedback keep you from purchasing. I didn't and am so glad I didn't. Being able to see my little one while at work is so great.
Baby,5.0,Lamaze infant toys are great,"The first infant toy we purchased for our son four years ago was Lamaze's Freddie Firefly. He and we loved it so much that Sir Prance A Lot is the first toy we purchased for our new daughter. We also bought some other Lamaze plush toys, and they're all fantastic. Simple, safe, but very novel for infants exploring their senses. Highly recommend"
Baby,5.0,Helps get rid of the Swaddle!,"I purchased one of these for my 6 month old daughter after my friend told me how much her son loves his. My daughter is a swaddle junkie but because she's rolling over now, we have to break her of the swaddle.  This cute little &#34;Wubbie&#34; is the perfect thing that keeps her little hands busy when she's trying to fall asleep. Instead of pulling her soothie out of her mouth and then focusing on putting it back in, she cuddles and plays with the little monkey. Great product!"
Baby,5.0,So cute!,The baby loves them.  She especially loves to grab them and remove them from her feet!  They are well made.
Baby,4.0,Used as mittens for baby.,Bought for my grandson to use as mittens and they worked great. He loved to beable to bite and suck on the bugs while riding in the car and they stayed on better than mittens.
Baby,2.0,Socks too tight,"My grandson love them but since the sock wouldn't stretch, we never got th<br />e whole sock on. He would just hold it and make it rattle."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,"My son loves this and that's what matters! We were given a wind-up mobile at our shower and although I was reluctant to use it, my son immediately took to it and it made naptime a breeze! However, going in his room every 5 minutes to wind it up was getting to be a nuisance. Found this one and although I was looking for black and white, the animals eyes are contrast enough. Great music choices, great motion, great running time (I usually start it once and he's out), night light is dim, but I don't use it anyway. Remote control is nice, but eats batteries way faster than the mobile itself. Awesome product!!"
Baby,4.0,"Innovative product, but does your newborn like this paci?","I loved the product! The monkey is super cute and well made. The stitching for the pacifier attachment is also very strong. However, my child didn't care for the paci. It's your regular newborn pacifier they give at the hospital, so try that on your child, and make sure she likes it, before you buy the product.<br />As it turned out, my daughter enjoyed her fist more than any paci, and now this monkey is just sitting in the toy bin."
Baby,3.0,Not for MY 0-3 Month old,"UPDATE##### I am changing my review to Neutral (3/5) because I now realize that my  (now) 6 month old does not like pacifiers. He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his \\""bewitching hour\\"", a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns."
Baby,5.0,Extra Pockets- A Must,This is a must for the parent on the go.  It fits great between the handlebars of a bob stroller and provides the extra storage and cup holders to make this a truly handy helper for the parent who is trying to take all that is needed to keep a baby or toddler comfortable.
Baby,5.0,Great product for the lprice! works with baby jogger citi mini stroller,I have not used this product much but it does the job for our baby jogger citi mini stroller and it's a lot cheaper than the baby jogger one sold at babies r us.
Baby,5.0,fits perfect!,"we have a bob stroller, it fit great. great materials and nice cup holders, love the zipper and the little pocket!"
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"Again, Lamaze and their wonderful toys for babies. Very colorful, lots of different visual spots to reach for and nice, easy on the ears sounds."
Baby,4.0,Works great,"While one of my 4 month olds finds  pacifiers generally cumbersome, the other loves pacifiers (specifically this one) and learned early on how to put it back in his mouth. I wish the monkey had a little weight to it (kind of like a beanie baby) so that the pacifier would sit on the baby's chest better if it falls out of his mouth. I definitely recommend this to others. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't make life easier right away (0-3 months old). Be persistent and they'll hopefully get used to it soon."
Baby,5.0,There are six in a package!,The listing doesn't specify that 6 do come in a package. YEA! They work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle. It has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding. A must have for breastfeeding moms.
Baby,3.0,So cute ... wish I had them when my daughter's feet were smaller.,"These are even cuter in person than they look online. My daughter loved them and played with them a lot. It's a lot more fun than just sucking on your own toes, right? But they were very small. I wish we had bought them sooner. My daughter was 6 months old when we got them, and I think they would have been better at about 3 months."
Baby,1.0,Way too expensive!,"$13 for a pacifier attached to a toy that I cannot remove and replace? ARE THEY NUTS?!! Anyone who would buy this has sucker written all over them! I used binky clips for all four of my kids and never had a problem with them. It made it easy to find it at night too. If your newborn baby is waking up every couple of hours searching for a nipple, they're probably hungry. Feed them instead of shoving a paci in their mouth! All of my newborns ate every couple of hours...they have tiny stomachs. I simply fail to see how this is not a suffocation hazard! They always says to keep blankets & stuffed animals away from babies faces!"
Baby,1.0,Utter Rubbish,"Had a ridiculous time trying to attach this to my stroller.  Attempted 4-5 different positions.  None of them would hold my latte in an upright, stable position.  Feel totally taken in.  Really!!!!!"
Baby,5.0,Fits my Baby Jogger Summit XC,"What can I say? It fits the stroller, is easy to put on/take off, holds all our stuff, and is less expensive than the Baby Jogger version. Perfect!"
Baby,5.0,Great!,"This stroller organizer fits my City Mini GT and my umbrella stroller.  Why pay more for a similar product?  It is high quality, fits most strollers and carries everything I need. I walk in the park with my son every day and it holds 2 water bottles (or cups), my phone and keys.  The price is right!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable Monkey!,He is cuter then the picture shows. I would recommend him for any Grandma who has a little one that loves<br />monkeys...or any cute animal. Good quality too!
Baby,2.0,band too small,"Lady bugs adorable, too bad the band wasn't elastic, baby wore it fir about 2 days.<br />Would not reccomend it."
Baby,1.0,Fisher Price Rainforest Peek A Boo Leaves Musical Mobile,I ordered one mobile and it had a defective motor.  I then returned it and ordered a second one of the same thing and the second one was worse than the first<br /><br />I always like Fisher Price.  I understand this one has been replaced by something similar so they must have had a lot of the same problems.
Baby,5.0,omg i dont know how we would have made it without these,the single most used item we have ever gotten for our son we now own 6 of them makes it easier for him to manipulate and gets tons of compliments cuz its just so cute
Baby,5.0,Amazing,I've been looking for a skinny top accessible wipe holder for so long. This is perfect. Durable and easy to grab a wipe with one hand glued to the baby.
Baby,5.0,baby loves staring at it!,"MMy baby is 7 weeks, loves staring at it. We use maxi cosi car seat, and it hangs on the bar just fine."
Baby,5.0,love it,"It has lights, movement and sound, all of which I was looking for in a mobile. The light is only on the base. The music goes for a long time, which I like. And my son likes watching the animals go in circles and the leaves flap. Mounted easily to two different cribs, although only to one side of my first son's crib. If you have a thick decorative ledge, you may have some issues."
Baby,3.0,I probably should have listened,Most of the review bash this product especially being so connected with apple. Well the concept and features are awesome. The constant disconnecting from the network is insane. Sometimes its every other minute. This is way too unreliable especially when you have a new born. It does work better in my old iphone 4. not good on the 5. i am contemplating getting a regular monitor
Baby,5.0,Cute Socks for a little cutie!,Just a little gift for a little girl who us curious and has fun with them.  ....... ....... ....... ....
Baby,5.0,Lifesaver...now how to wean?!,"My daughter absolutely loves this little monkey who we call \\""George.\\""  It has been her best buddy since she was about 4 months old and she's now 13 months. She does not care about any other pacifier except for this one and never has. If a baby could be addicted to something, our is addicted to George!  For those looking for a way to wash, I just throw him into the washing machine in a lingerie bag with the rest of her clothes and let him air dry.  My only concern is how we'll ever wean her off of him because this is definitely her lovey!"
Baby,5.0,my son loves it,i just bought a second wubbanub for my 12 month old son.  I bought the first one a year ago and the soothie is barely hanging on.  He loves walking around with the monkey.
Baby,5.0,6 month review,"I have had the unit for about six months now.  To be clear, this is a great monitor for portability and to see your children while away at work or wherever. Yes, two second delay. This was annoying. At first but I got used to it.  We still use a regular in home video monitor for the baby but the withings is used for my three year old and to take with us if we go somewhere.  It will drain your battery on your phone if you are streaming so please be aware of that.  I think it is great that my wife and I can always jump on and see what is going on at home with our phone or ipad."
Baby,1.0,Can't access through Internet,"Since delivery date till today, I'm trying to fix the issue I'm facing with iBaby monitor with i baby support team.<br /><br />Something wrong with DNS or our ISP. Well it's useless for now.<br /><br />Regards"
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I have been searching for toys for my son, and when it comes to things like this it's hard to find any that aren't girly.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this one, he's so cute and it's not a standard toy that i see a lot!  I love him and so far does my son."
Baby,5.0,Great toy for a young baby or motor development delayed baby!,"My baby has a hard time time holding on to toys. I like this giraffe because the velcro strap allows me to hang it on her gym, on her carrier, or on the bar above her play pen. Also, she likes to hold it in her stroller or swing. The soft giraffe is easy for her to hold and has many toys in one. It also has a crinkle sound area on the giraffes tummy that my baby really likes."
Baby,4.0,Does what it's suppose too!,The mobile moves perfectly.  The leaves open and close and the animals move around in a circle.  It is very heavy and must be attach to a crib with slates.  I'm just concern about the batteries.  It seems to drain them quickly.
Baby,5.0,Scored Big,I gave this to a friend for her baby and she loved it.  It is all I hoped it would be and more.
Baby,5.0,Love these,I first saw these when my first granddaughter was born but never purchased.  I bought one for my grandson and it is great.  He loves to hold the animal and it helps to keep track of his pacifier.  There are no loose or small pieces on the animal to worry about.  Great idea.
Baby,3.0,Good while wired but freeze in wi-fi,I found that Image is very good while connected in my wired network but it's freezing the image in WI-FI connection.
Baby,5.0,Nice product,"This product does exactly what I wanted - holds a water bottle, keys, phone, and a few other things I might bring with us on a walk I have a Baby Jogger City Mini stroller and it works perfectly - I do not need to remove it when I fold the stroller for storage. I also really like the price compared to the similar item made by Baby Jogger. I have only had it a short time so I can't comment yet on durability."
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,"2/5/2013<br /><br />The camera works very well using my iPhone 4S. Both my wife and I can simultaneously can use the iBaby App using our individual 4S phones. There is a 2-3 second delay, but otherwise the video quality is excellent and the audio is definitely usable. We went ahead and also bought the top rated Philips AVENT baby monitor for real-time high quality audio...however given the capability of the iBaby unit the Philips monitor seems redundant.<br /><br />The primary wi-fi router is downstairs but the nursery is upstairs. I use a power-line ethernet box (Netgear) to go from the downstairs router to 2nd upstairs wi-fi router. The iPhone and the camera have to be connected to the same router to work properly (upstairs). As a result I get a steady connection between the upstairs nursery and upstairs master bed. Easy."
Baby,1.0,I expected so much more,"I really wanted to like this, I even ignored the other reviews hoping that they were wrong. I really wish I hadn't - I was so disappointed! I tried to set it up and couldn't even get past the startup on my phone. The monitor wasn't recognized by my iPhone or my husband's iPad or droid phone. We tried several times before we eventually gave up. I can't have a baby monitor that is SO unreliable (especially one that I spent $300 on). Save yourself the time and aggravation and find another baby monitor."
Baby,5.0,Great,The kid loves it in the car when we are driving. This is a great product for a baby thanks.
Baby,5.0,Best little Accessory,"Use it all the time and so easy to remove wish i got two. Very easy to clean holds drinks, keys also great little zip pocket"
Baby,3.0,Design I like,"Wipes Case with unusual and nice.Handpicked too good to use, I love it ..<br />Wear on the stroller even think"
Baby,4.0,Love it.,"Very easy to use. Very practical and what I love most about it is that it folds with the stroller, so I don't have to remove it every time I need to fold the stroller."
Baby,5.0,My Grandbaby's FAVE toy!!!!,"Out of all the very many toys I researched and ordered for my infant grandbaby, this one was the Best! She loved it the most out of all the crib hanging toys. It goes every where baby goes! It's a great toy for crib, car seat, stroller, walker and every place in between. It has been easy to keep clean and sanitize. The toy has held up to alot of usage and still looks new. We have had no safety issues with this toy. I highly recommend it and glad I bought it."
Baby,5.0,Awesome,My baby nephew loves these and of course I spoil him rotten. This is actually his second one.  He loved the first one so much he wore it out
Baby,5.0,She LOVES it!,The material is super soft and so she loves to hold onto and pet at it. Very cute.. everyone that sees her with it OOOooss and awes. CUTE!
Baby,3.0,The baby couldn't care less,"Good stitching, but I can see where the velcro that keeps the bracelet on would wear out by the time one kid got through with these.  Also, as a toy that is supposed to stimulate, my baby couldn't care less about these guys.  He'd rather chew on his blanket or his glowworm."
Baby,4.0,Software needs to be improved,"As a straight out of the box camera to use on your Apple devices it works great, flawlessly even.  However the software included is horrible."
Baby,5.0,I Love WubbaNubs!,My 3rd child and the 1st pacifier that we successfully used. They are a little pricey but my baby will take it & the animals attached are adorable! We received the 1st one as a gift & have purchased 3 more. My baby can easily grasp the animals and play with it. I find it spends less time on the floor or getting lost because it's easier to hold.
Baby,5.0,Just what I needed,"I wanted a stroller organizer I can throw in my bottled water, cell phone and keys and its perfect. Its easy to attach to the stroller and my stroller is black so it works perfectly!"
Baby,5.0,Love this.,"I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best. They are easy to find, they don't roll when they hit the ground, and much easier for my daughter to get in her mouth on her own. We have two for wash days and I couldn't live without them."
Baby,1.0,Poorly-designed waste of time,"Our first experience with the iBaby camera was with an older 801.11b/g/n router. After following the instructions to the letter and much twiddling with the setup the camera did work briefly. But it kept losing connection with the older wireless router, so back to the store it went.<br /><br />Then we bought a newer dual-band 801.11b/g/n router that has terrific range/connectivity. We DOUBLED DOWN on the iBaby camera, purchasing two units, thinking, &#34;the problem must have been with the old router.&#34;<br /><br />WRONG¹. WRONG². No connectivity AT ALL this time, with either camera, under any circumstances.<br /><br />We tried everything we could find on the internet to resolve the problem (including one relating to use of range extenders on one of the dual bands, which we have in place) -- no luck.<br /><br />This is a poorly-designed, poorly-documented, overpriced product. Save yourself a lot of time/aggravation and don't buy."
Baby,2.0,Not worth it for the price,"My husband and I own the Withings scale and sleep monitor and have had nothing but positive things to say about them.  However, the Withings monitor is a completely different story.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shows the temp and humidity<br />Features we don't use but some may: microphone to talk to baby, light, and music<br /><br />Cons:<br />App is constantly buffering and often shuts down leaving your baby unattended.  (Isn't this the whole point of the monitor????)<br />Expensive for what you get...other brands are much better and cheaper<br />Unless you have a 1\\"" crib there is literally no way to mount the monitor.  We have ours dangling on the side of the crib, but will have to move it soon since our son is about to crawl<br />Drains your iphone battery within 2 hours if you have the video monitoring<br />Unlike other brands you cannot use more than one monitor at a time<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone."
Baby,5.0,another grand-baby joy,My new grand-son loves music and animals.  This mobile was great for him when he first went into the baby-bed from the bassinet.
Baby,5.0,Has been great,"We travel with it, and my wife watches the baby from work while I work at home.  When I travel--anywhere in the world--I can log in and see and talk to baby.  My only request is a desktop app so I can watch on my computer screen while working.  It works great, though, and the sound and light fixtures help with sleeping in the crib."
Baby,5.0,Prefect for Traveling,"I love this case! I was unsure when ordering that it would be what I wanted, but now that I see it I'm happy I ordered it. Great size, sturdy plastic, and easy (but not to easy) to open"
Baby,5.0,Keeps the little one busy,"Keeps my little girl busy for a good half hour.  Invaluable sanity saver, would recommend it to anyone looking for a mobile"
Baby,3.0,"Good idea, but..","Good idea, but something got wrong. When they fit my newborn, she wasn't really paying attention to them. Plus, the bugs were too heavy and made the socks to slip away. After 2/3 months she became interested in her feet, but by that time they didn't fit anymore. The rattles would probably have been a better fit for us."
Baby,5.0,Loved it,"So cute, my nephew took to it right away. Also easy to find if dropped.  Would definitely buy one again."
Baby,5.0,wubbanubs are fantastic,"We have 3 animals (kitty, monkey, and red puppy) and they are wonderful as pacifiers and as toys.  These pacifiers are hard to lose with a big fluffy animal attached to the end.  Our daughter loves these, and I have bought them as gifts for my new niece and other friends who are having or have had babies recently.  Totally recommend."
Baby,1.0,Very small and cheap.,The picture looks nothing like the actual product. It was small & very cheap. The little monkey was ugly and not even close to the picture. I'm returning it ASAP
Baby,1.0,REALLY quiet,"This is the quietest rattle, it makes almost no noise.  I would not recommend you buy it unless you are looking for decoration only for a child to look at."
Baby,3.0,I really wanted to love it...,"Baby is now 1 week old...I've rebooted and reinstalled this monitor almost every day since we receive the error &#34;unable to connect&#34;.<br />Even before the baby arrived, we were disappointed in just how much of a delay there is (on a extremely fast WiFi network), but figured the few seconds wouldn't be bad if the rest of the experience was ok.<br />The picture was good, I liked the temp/humidity options, as well as the ability to customize alerts...but you'll soon turn the alerts off, as the adjustable times for &#34;tolerance&#34; don't seem to affect anything and you'll soon have a page full of notifications on your ipad / iphone.  You'll also have to keep your iDevice somewhere off your person if you're checking on the little one - as the alerts have a loud chime that goes off when motion is detected.<br /><br />Finally, the internal battery must be for nothing more than keeping settings when moving it.  We put the little one in a swing and set the monitor nearby while cooking, and within 20 minutes the low battery notification went off (then triggering a reboot and cycle all over again to get it set up).<br /><br />It looks like it is just a bit early for it's time - wait for a more robust product that allows streaming to iDevices."
Baby,5.0,Great!! Just like i expected!!,"Excellent experience !!! I received everything correctly, the performance and quality of the product is just as I expected !!!"
Baby,5.0,i love wunnanubs,"whoever invented these are a genious. My son loved them and are so cute. they are way easier to find when droped vs a regular paci. i think i have boughten about ten of them. unfortanatly, my son has grown out of them and has bitten a hole in the paci and no longer can use them. but anyone that has a baby who uses a paci needs to have one of these! you wont regret it, promiss! The monkey was my favorite, but they are all cute."
Baby,1.0,Don't buy this item!,Great concept but the product does not live up to the description.  Red button needs 2 hands to slide (it is not Quick or Easy!) and it does not snap closed securely.  The sides are not sealed tight when closed and the wipes dry out.<br /> I scheduled a return and thankfully Amazon just told me to keep this and refunded my money.  It is in the trash and Amazon saved the shipping cost by not having me return something that should not be resold.
Baby,3.0,cute,These footie finders are real cute.  My daughter seems to like them.  The only issue I have is that they do not rattle enough.
Baby,3.0,"Not sure if they're doing anything, but it doesn't hurt.","As others have said, they don't make a lot of noise, sort of like a bead rolling around, but its a nice subtle ting and the baby can certainly hear it.  Our baby is only a month old so hopefully this will get him exploring the sounds fairly soon.  Since he's still pretty small it fits just fine though I can see how an older baby of a few months would be a bit tight.  He doesn't really care about them right now but its still too early to tell.  Anyway, they're cute, cheap and it doesn't hurt to try."
Baby,5.0,Sealing discs,These work great for nursing moms. They come 6 per pack and well worth it. It makes it so much easier to store it and quickly use it again when needed
Baby,5.0,My son enjoys it.,"I bought this when my baby was 2 months old. It was not really useful for him at that time because it will not lull him to sleep.<br />At around 9 months, he started enjoying the music and it helps him sleep. He also loves playing with it before he goes to sleep and when he wakes up.  He is able to stand up and turn on and off the music himself.  He enjoys looking at the mobile and enjoys &#34;talking&#34; to the animals."
Baby,5.0,Perfect to keep track of,"Don't worry about losing the pacifier anymore with this awesome product. We have two different ones and my baby loves them!  At just 2 months old he figured out how to wrap his arm around the animal and push his binky in his mouth, and now at 7 months old he loves to hold the animal while he sucks on the binky.<br />We also used one of these for my older son, and when we were ready to wean him from the binky we cut the tip of the binky off and he still had the animal to comfort him. It really helped him with the transition."
Baby,5.0,good,i bought this item<br />I like this. This is Very good price & Very Good Quality<br />My wife also like this.
Baby,5.0,LIke the easy access,I really like this baby wipe case.  The slide over button makes accessing the wipes easy and you don't have to open it each time and risk getting too many wipes or having trouble getting it closed.
Baby,5.0,Excelente,"El producto lleg&oacute; a tiempo, sin contratiempos, sin problemas el producto de muy buena calidad. La atenci&oacute;n del vendedor muy buena"
Baby,5.0,Love it,I have attached it to the bouncy chair and my 7 week baby is grabbing at it. Love the design and bright colours. A well made product.
Baby,4.0,Ibaby monitor,Love this item!!! So much better than a reg baby monitor ... I can see my<br />Baby even when I leave the house
Baby,5.0,Great!,What can I say?<br /><br />The crinkling hooves made my 6 month old love it!  He also loved holding onto the two rings on the tail and would fall asleep that way.  Lamaze products are great!!
Baby,5.0,Most Excellent !!!,This is the Monitor you want. Works great with awesome features. Worth the money for sure.<br />The interaction with the iPhone app is perfect from Anywhere!
Baby,5.0,Fun footies and mits,These are asas expected whenwhen viewing the pic. Our daughter has fun with them on her hands or feet. The  rattles inside are more like bells. They still distract and entertain her at 10 months.
Baby,5.0,great product,my baby loves it. I received this pretty quick and was very satisfied. this is small and easy to take along with us everywhere.
Baby,4.0,A good deal,"I like this product, true to description, stays on by Bugaboo, coffee cups fit a little too tight, but that's a good thing<br />One drawback - the only zipped pocket is made of mesh. So I can not put money or cell phone there when it is raining or snowing outside. I realize that many people don't need to stroll when the weather is bad, but in some climates you have bad weather pretty much all the time, and I guess Diono, as a company coming from Washington state, should be aware of that :)<br />So I wish that had two pockets, one with mesh and one solid. Otherwise - a good deal, much better use of money than Bugaboo's genuine cupholder."
Baby,5.0,Perfect Gift for an Infant!,I purchased this item for my grandson.  I was looking for items that would get the attention of an infant who was interested in lights and sounds.  I found this item to be what I was looking for.  The items were packed securely and quickly arrived.  I would purchase from this vendor again.  Thank you for working with Amazon.com

Baby,4.0,Little one enjoys it,"My son has no interest in pacifiers.  When he first started getting some teething pain, he liked to chew on things, but couldn't manipulate a teether toy.  We got this for him and he really likes it.  He chews on the pacifier part, the hands, the feet, the tail, evereything.  He can easily manipulate it and it's now one of the only things that keeps him from fussing in the car.  My only concern is that the pacifier used in this toy is for newborn - 6 months.  My son may still want this when he's a  little older.  I wish they also made them with the 6 month + pacifiers."
Baby,5.0,Grows with the child,Great play mat. My daughter loved it and still enjoyed playing with it when she was walking. She would sit on it and read or play with her toys. Now I use it for my twin girls and they love it as well. The mat washes up nicely in the machine and the colors have not faded.
Baby,1.0,Stopped rotating,"After using for just one month, the rotating part stopped working. Just the music box alone is working. Called the service center people but was not helpful. Waste of money."
Baby,5.0,monkey pacifier,I ordered this for my great grand baby. She loves it - in fact it is about the only pacifier she will take. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a new baby.
Baby,4.0,Works nicely and is far cheaper than the Britax version,The only issue we encountered was that it tends to slide down a bit on the Britax B-Agile stroller we have if we didn't put the velcro on tight enough. This causes your cup to tip slightly (due to the back of the stroller pushing against the organizer) and can lead to small spills.<br /><br />But it does work really nicely otherwise. We put towels and baby toys in there and they don't fall out. Super useful.
Baby,1.0,You're better of monitoring your baby with two tin cans and a string!,"Great concept, awesome features (if they worked)... love the idea, HATE the product.  I haven't written a negative review before but this is my baby's safety we are talking about.  This isn't a money issue either.  I would pay twice as much if the stupid thing did what it was supposed to.  It consistently reads 4-5 degrees warmer in the room than in reality (not a deal breaker but annoying) half the time the audio works but the video doesn't and at least twice a night it looses connectivity all together! DEAL BREAKER! We run a business from our home and our internet connection is our livelihood so...no, it is not a connectivity/WiFi issue!  Don't trust your your baby's well being to a defective product!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"Simple, Cheap and good looking toy. My 4 month old girl loves these. IT is a simple toy that will entertain your baby for hours."
Baby,5.0,monkey,I ordered for my great grand daughter because she likes monkeys-easy to keep up with pacifier because she likes to throw it-
Baby,3.0,Sizes Vary,"I bought a second monkey wubbanub after a friend gave me one we loved. Sadly, the new one I bought was neither the same size nor plushness as the first. My guess is it's due to manufacturer or production time differences, but the new one was about 30% smaller in length and stuffing. The fabric was also inferior. The pacifier was the same, though."
Baby,4.0,CUTE BRACELETS,"The products are smaller than I expected.  However they are cute anyhow, and considering they are for babies anyway, I am happy with them, especially with the rattles when shaken.  They will make a ok presents."
Baby,5.0,Very cute,This is such a nice mobile. I am very happy with this purchase. I wish I had this hen my daughter was a newborn. The music is very nice. The overall quality is excellent!
Baby,2.0,Doesn't work the way it should,"we bought this mobile for my baby and unfortunately baby never had a chance to see how it is spinning, because it always stops right after big leave goes down. Those big leaves make stop all toys from spinning. I tried to take leaves out- and it started to work better, however we liked the idea of toys and leaves. Music is boring for this mobile, we have same theme play mat and it has better music selection. The only thing that I actually liked- colorful toys, these colors made my baby keep staring and wondering."
Baby,3.0,Video Lag too long,"Great and easy setup.  However, we found the video lag too long, so it ends up being an audio monitor with still frames of your child.  Its a bit too pricy for an audio monitor.  We are returning it and going with Foscam cameras.  The setup is more complicated, but once you have it up and running the video and audio are great."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"Cheapest place to buy them is on Amazon. You get a package of 6 for this price. They work great to seal bottles, and it's always nice to have extras of these, especially if you're going to freeze/store your milk."
Baby,4.0,Withbaby,"Overall, I really do like this monitor. That said, I always use a cheap audio monitor at night and while he's napping. I use this monitor to check on him when I hear him make noises or when I just want to peek on him and not wake him up. The withings monitor just isn't consistent enough for long term use, and it kills your iPhone or ipad battery. But it is really nice when you want to check on them without going in the room and waking them. I also love that when he wakes up too early in the am, I can turn on the nightlight and sound from my bed and that usually keeps him occupied until I get up or until I finish getting ready. He's also figured out how to turn them on and will do so himself now at 9 months. It's pricey, but worth every penny when you want to watch them breathe at night!"
Baby,5.0,Much better than Skype,"We started with Skype set up on an old laptop. Had the webcam so it was free. Worked fine for the first year. Saw this at a friends house and loved having the night vision. Decided to buy it so we'd be able to monitor him at night without waking him up.<br />The setup was much easier than I expected. The app guides you through everything and I had it fully functioning in the first five minutes. The picture is great, specially in the dark. Now I just need to get it mounted on the wall where it's convenient.<br />The only problem we've noticed is the audio. Right now there is a clicking going on but I think it's because it's sitting next to the old laptop running Skype. I'll move it tomorrow after he wakes up and see if it fixes it.<br />After reading reviews, I didn't think the alerts worked very well but after testing for a couple minutes, it seems they work great. We put him down and he was moving around. I was watching him on my phone and set the sensitivity for the motion alert and within 30 seconds, my wife's phone was ringing an alert. I'm not interested to use it all the time but I think it will come in handy at times.<br />There's no visible light coming from the camera and you can't even see it sitting in a dark room. I think the posts that say they see a light may have the led light turned on. Haven't exactly figured out what this is but I think it may turn on an extra light. Messing around with it, I haven't noticed any difference.<br /><br />So far very pleased. Hope it continues to perform."
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"My 4 month old was not sleeping in his crib until we purchased this, now he will lie down under the mobile and fall asleep! The remote is also a very cool option so I don't have to get out of bed to turn it on when I hear the baby start to fuss.<br /><br />This mama appreciates the extra sleep!"
Baby,3.0,Stopped working,Bought this mobile baby loves it but the leaves on the mobile stopped working after 1month. It only works when you take off the leaves then the animals turn!
Baby,5.0,Vonnegut at his best,This is a book I fell in love with in the 70's!!! I laughed and laughed. Cat's Cradle is one two Vonnegut books that are the best books I have ever read.
Baby,5.0,Stop being a human pacifier! Buy this!,"I have notoriously high-maintenance babies: colic, reflux, dairy intolerance...anything that could make sleep difficult, they have. I have been the human pacifier for far too long, but not so anymore! This mobile is pure magic.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />Leaves flutter up and down, as well as traditional spinning mobile action. Very enticing to baby.<br /><br />Music is nice, not annoying. Mine are all labeled correctly, unlike some reviews I read.<br /><br />Light is a dim, soft glow. Enough to see baby by, but not too bright to keep baby awake.<br /><br />Been using it heavily for 3+ weeks now and no indication that the batteries are wearing down yet. So, doesn't just devour them which is nice.<br /><br />Has a remote<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The remote. It is one button, which I sometimes have to click a couple times to make work. It turns the mobile back on to whatever lights/music combo you last had it set at (mobile plays for 15 minutes and then automatically shuts off). HOWEVER. The remote will only work to turn the mobile on/off for one hour since the last time you pushed a button on the actual mobile itself. Guess they don't want you to leave your baby crying for more than an hour before you have to actually go to him/her. ;) Smart idea I guess."
Baby,1.0,It doesn't work!!!!,"It doesn't work!!!, I change the batteries, and try and try and even try, but it never started to work."
Baby,5.0,"perfect for price, durability and flexibility","This organizer is inexpensive and wonderful. my little boy is almost 3 and I needed something that I'd be able to fold up easily with my city mini. I didnt want to have to take the organizer off every time I folded the stroller, how annoying that would be! This doesnt get crushed when stroller folds, but you have to take your stuff out of the organizer before folding or it will likely fall out after folding (keys, gloves etc.) i also like how it's made out of wiring, which makes it flexible if you have a larger or smaller cup and don't want it to move around while you're strolling. the organizer is also not bulky like the baby jogger one looks. it's a very simple design and allows you to just throw things in and take them out at ease, such as keys, hats, gloves, phone, drinks, etc. convenient. worth it. however, it doesn't have all the coverage like zippers and velcrow, but I dont need all that anyway. there is one zipper pocket that ive never used but  its also a plus."
Baby,5.0,Nephew loved it.,Very fast shipping. Baby loved it for a while. Think it did get old after a while. But definitely kept him occupied for a bit.
Baby,1.0,not that great,it was kinda flimsy the wires kept coming off and my daughter didnt like to play with it any more after her having to ask to string them over and over.
Baby,4.0,Bulky size,"Great product in functionality, however, it is a little bulky in size.  I'm not sure why they had to make it 2 inches longer than the standard wipes size.  1 inch would have been sufficient for a little wiggle room."
Baby,4.0,cute,"This paci is very cute, I plan to buy more.  I just wish the  paci was removable.  I guess that's the point though  if  paci goes bad, you have to buy a brand new wubby.  I kind of want to try to make my own."
Baby,4.0,Occupies the time just fine,"These little things does the job as it states and does what I need it to do, buy me time with the kid."
Baby,5.0,Stroller accessory,I ordered this to accessorize my stroller and to have extra storage for small items within reach while strolling. It's been a year and I still use it.
Baby,5.0,I like this,I bought this for the baby to grow with because the head rest for 0-4 months and the other things for when baby is older.
Baby,2.0,Cant see in dark rooms.,Infrared does not work properly. Cant see in night time in babes room. It does not worth the value ask for.
Baby,5.0,Thanks fellow reviewers,"Based on everyone's glowing feedback, I knew I had to get this one and sure glad I did. The price was a major factor. Pimpin up the baby stroller is an expensive proposition, so when I learned I could get one compatible with my Jogger Mini GT for fraction of the price and with more options, I couldn't resist. I use it for holding drinks and use the zipped pockets for keys/phone and the main compartment for various items. The alternatives could cost 3x more."
Baby,5.0,Love this!,So much less expensive than the rest and just as effective.  My stroller didn't come with a cup holder so I needed something for my walks around the block with my baby. This item did exactly what I needed and didn't break the bank.
Baby,5.0,helpful,"has been very useful, also bought Philips AVENT BPA in baby bottles to store. and not use the nipples. good product"
Baby,5.0,A good product,"So far I really like this product. It fits my bob and although it has soft material, it does have shape. I like the two cup holders and the inside pocket. It's a good price compared to the bob handle ba console."
Baby,5.0,Cute & Functional,"Oooohhh, I love this case. Holds a good many wipes, easy to find in your diaper bag but not too bulky, durable, simple to access the wipes. Overall well-designed at a nice price. I'll probably use this long past the baby stage."
Baby,4.0,Cute product,"I like it for it's variety of textures, yet wished it was still set up a little different.  I ordered it for a child who is visually impaired and he doesn't seem to like it as much as I do.  It's a good size.  it has a loop to attach it to other things and it's colorful."
Baby,5.0,My daughter's best friend,"We got one of these when my daughter was only a few months old. She is almost 2 now and has to have the Wubbanub when she goes to sleep. It's like her best friend. Although she doesn't use the pacifier feature anymore, it's still a toy that provides her comfort. We named him George after Curious George. Great buy!"
Baby,4.0,"very cute, simple and entertaining for little one","I saw this at walmart for more than it was on amazon, the toys can be moved around and it comes with an adorable little pillow for the baby's head. My daughter threw up the first day we used it but it was easy to clean and wash and still looks new. I love this play mat."
Baby,5.0,Love this little guy,"Everyone just thinks this thing is the best. He is soooo cute! Out little boy loves it as well, though at 12 weeks, he is starting to associate it with bedtime and fights like no other! The only thing I worry about is how to wash it? The paci dos not disconnect from the stuffy."
Baby,5.0,Love it,I bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he absolutely love it. He grabs it and play with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Fisher-Price Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym a healthy entertainment for my baby,"100 % recomendado, se lo regale a mi niña y le encanto muchisimo es un exelente juguete asegura horas de diversion saludos desde venezuela"
Baby,4.0,So cute!,I love them.  My granddaughter... not so much.  Maybe when she's a bit older...  She's only 3 months old now.
Baby,5.0,Love wubbanubs!,"We first found these three years ago when our first was a baby. They are so cute, but are really great because it is harder to lose than just a soothie. They can not roll out of the crib in the middke of the night and a child can easily find it in their crib and put it back in their mouth when they want it. My daughter is two and still has hers, but she got a hold in the soothie part and was very upset. It wpuld be nice to be able to change those out. We just sewed a new one on. It doesn't look that great but she loves it!"
Baby,2.0,Not good as rattles,"I was rather disappointed with these; the rattles are very faint and the sizing is small, so if you have a robust child then they will probably not fit. My son does like to suck on these (although to be honest he sucks on everything within reach) but other than that there's not much to them. I would have liked a stronger rattle, which is the reason why I got them.<br /><br />I currently use them to attach other toys to the handle of his car seat since the velcro is good for that and strong enough that he can't yank the toys down on himself."
Baby,5.0,Fits Chicco Liteway Plus Stroller,"Just received this today.  It fit my Liteway Plus stroller perfectly!!  I have not started using it, but it will definitely get the job done and looks well constructed."
Baby,4.0,Good lids,"These lids seal up the Advent bottles perfectly, have had no leaks while using.  Be aware that these replace the nipple so you will need to carry it separately while the sealing disc is in use."
Baby,5.0,Work well,These snap right into place and keep a secure seal. I use wet erase markers to mark the date on top. A good investment for added convenience.
Baby,5.0,EAD loves Logan!,"We have more than a few Lamaze toys and this one is by far Elizabeth's favorite. It attaches well to her stroller, her Pop and Play and her car seat, so he is always right there and always safe from getting lost. He has great tactual features for her development and he is well constructed so I don't worry about her choking on anything as she shoves him in her face. I would absolutely recommended Logan, or any other Lamaze toy, to anyone that asked."
Baby,3.0,"Nice for parents, not as attractive to the babies","I have 4 month old twins and they are just about ready to start enjoying a musical mobile.. I had a hand-me-down manual winni-de-pooh mobile which I used on the kids since they were 2.5 months.. And they loved the soft music and the figures revolving around the mobile.... The manual winding however barely runs the mobile for approx10 secs, and as my kids loved it so much,I thought I'll buy a battery operated one... When I received this, I thought it was beautiful.. Vibrant colors, the palm fronds moving up and down, and the remote.. HOWEVER , my kids did not enjoy it as much.. The animals are way too close to each other, there are just too many things clustered together...and the strings from which the animals hang are way too short.....they will stare at the manual one which is simpler, just 4 animals on a longer string , it helps them distinguish the figures easily.. My twins adore the manual mobile, a musical mobile is a must have on anyone's crib.. Just the sight of seeing happy babies is worth the little money spent... But this one just doesn't cut it as much.. The music however is nice, still not as nice as the manual one, and I felt the sound was a little low .."
Baby,5.0,Can't live without it...now that it works,"When we first got this mobile it stopped working after just a few weeks. Like other reviewers said it kept getting stuck and wouldn't turn. However, I emailed Fisher Price about the problem and they IMMEDIATELY sent me a new mobile for free. It arrived a couple days after I sent the email with an apology. It was by far the best customer service experience I have ever had. I am really impressed.<br />Now for the review of the working mobile. It is really great. The music it plays is really soothing and puts my baby right to sleep. I also love the remote to turn the music off. I rock the baby near the crib/mobile and then when he falls asleep I turn the mobile off with the remote and then put the baby in the crib. Perfect.<br />When the baby wakes up he likes to stare up at the little moving creatures and leaves that go up and down. So it entertains him for a while, which I love. Like I said - I can't live without it...now that it works."
Baby,3.0,not a great fit,Does not fit well on a sleigh bed crib.  It does not fit around front or back and for side railing it doesn't tighten enough to secure the mobile.
Baby,1.0,waste of money,These were a waste of money as they did not fit my bottles properly and the bottles did not seal and leaked.  I threw them away.
Baby,4.0,Love this,Our little boy just loves this. He's still trying to grab and hold things and kept knocking his soother out of his mouth. But this stays in place and he can hold on to it against his chest.
Baby,5.0,Happy with purchase,"Excellent article, very nice for my child, I enjoyed. We recommend.<br /><br />Excelente art&iacute;culo, muy bonito para mi ni&ntilde;o, me gust&oacute; mucho. Lo recomiendo."
Baby,5.0,Excellent product,"Excellent article, very nice for my child, I enjoyed. We recommend.<br /><br />Excelente art&iacute;culo, muy bonito para mi ni&ntilde;o, me gust&oacute; mucho. Lo recomiendo."
Baby,5.0,Love these,Got this one as a present for my sister in law but my son had them when he was tiny.  They are the perfect size to fit in their hands and hold in their mouth and adorable.  I only wish you could replace the pacifier - we had a dog who liked to chew them!
Baby,4.0,I like it!,"I like the sleek design of this product that's why I was drawn to buying it aside from the simplicity of the color combination which are two of my fave.  It works well with keeping the wipes inside but what I do just to make sure the wipes stay wet, is to keep the original plastic container of the disposal wipes inside and remove the hard cover so it won't be bulky when you close this case:).  However, I wish the case is thicker than this so we can put a 72-wipe ct or more per trip just to make sure that we don't run out of supplies...I just had a big disastrous adventure for bringing in the number of wipes I could fit to maximize the case:("
Baby,5.0,This is so much better that the others at BabysRUS,"I love the fact that you only need the base. You can take it with you and it can use bluetooth. It is also made very sturdy unlike the $300 Summer one that feels like a cheap toy.  Can't say enough good things about this,"
Baby,1.0,Why can I see other people's babies????,"Do Not Recommend! I can see other people's kids on my iPad more than half the time. It isn't instant on. Trying to turn on isn't easy. For $300, I expected more. I'll be returning this."
Baby,5.0,very cute,"My 2 mo old daughter loves this toy, it hangs from her bassinet hood, instead of using the mobile it came with, it twirls around within grabbing reach, which she is working very hard at."
Baby,2.0,meh,"I was kinda bummed that the soothie wasn't clipped to the monkey, it was sewn on. which means no sterilizer and no way to attach it to the other pacifiers my kid takes. kinda lame."
Baby,5.0,Best wipe case out there,"Ok, it's a splurge as far as wipe cases go. However, it's quality is definitely much better, the plastic is sturdier and its much better looking. Also, i feared that it will be too big for my diaper bag ( Sip Hop Duo Dash Nixon) but its actually a very good size."
Baby,4.0,Good product,Easy to setup.  A bit pricey but worth it for the peace of mind.<br /><br />Good functionality and easy to use from most smart phones
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,"Sir prance a lot is so much fun, there are lots of different sounds, his feet crinkle and his head rings,  his rings rattle,  he has lots of nooks and crannies for a babies hand to grab onto the toy."
Baby,5.0,Wheelchair use.,I use this bag for my power wheelchair. It' works fine on the arm. I have the use of only one arm.
Baby,4.0,Baby likes it...,"So I guess that is was matters most. Her nursery is mostly pink, so I tried to find one that would match her decor and couldn't really find one so I started looking for one that has the best reviews. It keeps her entertained for about 20 minutes sometimes, which is pretty good for her, and she can fall asleep to it as well.<br /><br />However, beware of the packaging when you go to assemble this mobile. The items are sealed in bags but the tiny little screws that the animal pieces attach to are just loose in each animal piece bag and I didn't realize until too late and lost one. Just be careful."
Baby,5.0,Makes Life Easy,This makes it so easy when we travel. We can store the water in here and just add the formula when he's ready to eat.
Baby,5.0,Perfect with our Joovy stroller,"I love our stroller but there was no place for cell phones, drinks, etc. This was the perfect addition.  The straps can be adjusted so it fits perfectly on the handle bar on our stroller.  Can't imagine having a stroller without this!"
Baby,5.0,Great customer service and product,"I bought one after reading countless reviews and thought I'd go ahead with this one given its great price against competitors. After a month of using it and liking it, the inner zip broke. I contacted Amazon about it, sent it back and they promptly replaced it with a new one. Was very impressed with their quick reply and action. Overall, I like this Diono organizer. I find the inner zip is what I use the most, great for a job and I need a discreet place to keep keys and change. I'm using it with a Citi Mini stroller and it works awesome."
Baby,5.0,"Baby girl, 5 months, LOVES it","She smiles every time she sees her dragons toothy grin. She likes her Sir Prance a Lot, and the Peacock, too, but the Owl wasn't impressive, apparently.  Lamaze toys are the best!"
Baby,5.0,Convenient,"It has the perfect size to fit in our skip hop diaper bag.  Works as a dispenser, material is sturdy but easy to open and close."
Baby,1.0,love the product if it weren't defective and if the customer service was responsive!,I HAVE THE BABY MONITOR. I HAVE REPORTED AN ISSUE. THEY HAVE CONFIRMED MY MONITOR IS DEFECTIVE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WANTS ME TO SEND MY BABY MONITOR BACK TO THEM WITHOUT SENDING ME A REPLACEMENT PRIOR TO THE RETURN. THIS IS THE MONITOR FOR MY BABY!!!!! THIS IS NOT A SCALE OR A BODY ANALYZER... IT IS MY LIFELINE FOR MY CHILD!!!! AGAIN THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM IS THE MONITOR! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR THIS COMPANY IS AWFUL FOR THE AMOUNT YOU PAY TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!

Baby,1.0,SMELLS AWFUL!,"Had to put it back in the box and then outside.  Smelled like gasoline.  Awful manufacturing.  Disappointing, looks like a nice product."
Baby,4.0,Good organizer but not for city mini double,Doesn't work at all to hold drinks of any kind on my city mini gt stroller. Good organizer though overall-good fabric and sturdy. Wish it worked for us!
Baby,4.0,"Super cute, great nipple, but not great for 2-3 month olds!","Our baby likes the nipple on this paci, but it's not ideal for our infant.  Now that he's grabbing things he often pulls out the paci by tugging on the monkey.  Maybe he'll grow to hold it in his mouth as he gets older??  I don't know, but overall I still think it's a cute paci and it works most of the time."
Baby,5.0,Recommend the wubbunub to everybody!,We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved).<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky.<br />- Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky.<br />- Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes.<br />- You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.
Baby,1.0,Returned,"It was actually a lot larger than I expected but none-the-less decided to give it a try. First, I was disappointed because I expected it to do more...the problem with that was probably because some of the buttons didnt even work! Returned it...definitely not what I expected...and it was broke."
Baby,3.0,Is okay!,"The mobile a cute, but it doesn't work that well when rotating to the music. The leaves and animals kind of get caught in the metal pole that is supposed to be the tree trunk."
Baby,4.0,Wonderful Idea,I really liked these socks but they were very tight on my grandson's legs and feet. When he could no longer wear them we put them on his stuffed toy.
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"Save yourself some hassle and some $$$ and get this organizer! We bought it for our City mini stroller. Fits everything I could need in there and you can't comp,aim about the price. Liked it so much we bought another one for our friend!"
Baby,5.0,work great with Avent bottles,"We bought these to use with Avent bottles to store breast milk. They work great, we have not had any leaks!"
Baby,5.0,Household MUST!,"We have several of these and continue to buy them for family members.  Great for new babies to keep the nuk in by just setting the animal on a blanket.  Great for toddlers because they put their own nuk in.  Easy clean, just throw in the washer and dryer.  Once there cracked just cut off the nuk and you have a toy still.  Win, Win."
Baby,1.0,Smells Horrible,"I unwrapped this caddy and was hit by a horrible chemical/gasoline smell. I attached it to my stroller anyway, figuring it just needed to air out. When I returned to the room a couple of hours later, I could smell it from across the room. So I put it outside to air out. Three days later, it still managed to make the whole room smell. I will return it and find an alternative."
Baby,1.0,don't buy it!,"I am really frustrated! I bought it and shipped it to Qatar.  The camera didn't work, I emailed the withings company many times it takes them long time to respond.  Then, they decided since I bought it through amazon I have to contact amazon!! I am very upset that I lost 270$ !"
Baby,4.0,Using for City Select Stroller,"I love the price of this item instead of paying for the stroller brand drink holder.  I'm not sure that it is perfect for my CS Double stroller, but it works and can be adjusted based on what I need to use it for."
Baby,5.0,great to use,"Even though I ordered the &#34;Sunshine Kids&#34;, got the &#34;Diono&#34; instead, I am ok with the product. It is very easy to use and helps me a lot when using the stroller. I can fit one bottle for my baby and one for me, plus my cell phone and probably one more toy... that's about it."
Baby,4.0,"Loved the look, baby not too interested...","I loved the look, super cute. Not sure if my daughter is too small and doesn't quite take too much interest in it. Hope that she'll like it later. ( she was 5 mths. now 6 mths)"
Baby,4.0,Love it!,"The colors and music are a lot of fun for my baby. She can keep looking at it for a long time, but it has too many stimulations and so she cannot fall to sleep looking at it. Its more for play time than sleep time."
Baby,4.0,Second time buy,"This is our second time buying this product as the first one got moldy from some spilled milk we didn't realize had spilled.  It's very sturdy and fits on our City Mini stroller perfectly while being less than half the cost of the Baby Jogger Parent Console.  However, it cannot be washed in the washing machine (gentle cycle) which we learned the hard way with our first one.  The metal support around the top cracked and popped through the canvas."
Baby,4.0,Great,"There are 6 in this pack, the only thing I noticed is that Avent has started making these much thinner than they used to."
Baby,1.0,Horrible customer service & literature wrong,"I got this product for my sister for Christmas.  She was unsure of its compatibility with an Android phone she was interested in buying. The company took several weeks to get back to her about the compatibility, but in its literature said it was compatible with Ice Cream 4.0. After trying to install and test the product, she found it wasn't working.  She contacted Withings again.  It took them months to get back to her.  Finally they said that their product is NOT compatible with Ice Cream 4.0, in direct contradiction of their literature.  Awful experience- don't waste the time / money."
Baby,5.0,Great!,Great quality!  Glad I ordered it.  Exactly what I wanted and it is very good quality.  Would buy again.  I would recommend.
Baby,4.0,cutie,"to hang it on baby carrier.<br />good product,<br />it's cheaper than other site. that's enough.<br />it has variety colors, my baby love it."
Baby,5.0,Love it.,"I have purchased this item numerous times for numerous strollers. It is solid holds 2 drinks/bottles/sippy cups, your keys or cel phone and has a zipper pocket for cash/metro card.<br /><br />I used to move it from my double to single stroller but I now have one that stays on my single stroller and 2 for my double stroller.<br /><br />Great buy!"
Baby,5.0,Brilliant,This style of pacifier ended up being our first child's favorite &#34;binky&#34;.  We were not able to attach it to the standard clips so we spent lots of time chasing it around and then cleaning it whenever it dropped on the ground.  I saw someone with a WubbaNub after my first child had given up pacifiers.  I made sure to buy two of these for my second child and he loved it.  It gives them something to cuddle and hang on to while they suck away.<br /><br />I recommend these for any parent open to pacifiers.
Baby,3.0,not as cute in real life,"the picture is a lot cuter than what it actually is, although it is still cute. Its also a lot smaller than what it looks like online. The pacifier isn't the best quality. Took way too long to be delivered, because of that alone I will never order from this seller again. If I saw this product in the store I might buy the other animals, but not worth the shipping and waiting since its not the greatest quality."
Baby,5.0,very cute toy,My daughter loves it. Before we bought this we had the wrist rattle which she always loves shaking and barely looked an played with her feet now she can shake and try to grab the toys on her feet and when we take them off she trys to grab her toes but shes a little fatty cake lol
Baby,5.0,Grandson loves this!,"My grandson has this same monkey as his favorite stuffed animal except this is smaller.  When I found this Monkey Wubbanub on amazon, I had to get it for him.  He loves it!  It is so nice to have a pacifier attached to something.  It is rarely on the floor.  I bought this for him when he was 3 months old and he's 51/2 months now and he still loves it!"
Baby,4.0,Works with the City Micro baby jogger.,Works with the City Micro baby jogger and much cheaper than the one Baby Jogger sells! Straps are completely covered with velcro so very adjustable.
Baby,5.0,Best $8 I ever spent!,"I was looking for a toy to put on my then 3m old son's carseat, and I bought this item because of the great reviews. I wasn't dissapointed. My now 4m old LOVES it! Keeps him entertained for a long time. Currently his favorite leg is the one with the two beads on it."
Baby,5.0,How cute and cheap.,We all love spoiling our kids. And when you find toys that are priced well it makes it that much easier. These are made very well. They are so easy to strap on the wrist of the baby and the baby loves them. I am a fan.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money!,"We got the ibaby monitor despite its bad reviews and truly regret our decision! My husband and I are both engineers so we are quite technical and computer saavy.  We thought that others who had difficulty with the monitor maybe were just not very computer saavy, but we were wrong.<br />The monitor is difficult to get set up on your wireless network. The app is quite klunky and frequently locks up (we use it on iPad 3,iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S).  It is difficult to toggle between cameras (we have two), and the overall functionality is poor.<br />We actually disconnected our monitors and bought a cheap digital monitor that works much better.<br />My advice is to save your money and don't buy this monitor! It's not worth the money! Don't let the name fool you. This us NOT an Apple product and you can tell!"
Baby,5.0,Possibly the best baby purchase we made,"We love this product and have had not problems with it since getting it.  This has possibly been the best baby prodcut we purchased.  I love the fact that I can watch my baby sleeping on my iPhone from work; its awesome!  I also love the features on this device including the temperature and humidity of the room, the night light, noise maker, and alerts.  Probably my most favorite feature is the fact I can talk to my baby while I am at work and watch her look back at me through the camera.  The temperature and humidity reader is great to make me aware of the temp and humidity in her room especially at night.  I can monitor it and make adjustments if needed.  The night light and noise maker are fantastic for helping my baby sleep.  Sometimes she just looks at the night light (we have it set on changing colors) until she falls asleep.  The video monitor has been so helpful for night-time to ensure my baby is safe, and to see what the problem may be when she is crying before I have to get up out of bed.  But of course the thing I love best is being able to watch her sleep or play in her crib while I am at work, and being able to talk to her through the monitor."
Baby,4.0,Cute!,"We already had Freddie the Firefly, an early favorite, so this toy has not gotten quite as much love as that one, but I like the different sounds and textures.  Lamaze toys are always a good choice for the under-1 set."
Baby,5.0,Works great!,The slide is easy to open & shut which is important when trying to change a squirmy baby!  It holds a decent amount of wipes & fits in my diaper bag well.
Baby,1.0,NOT compatible with Natural bottles.,The sealing discs I received are different from the picture shown. They are NOT compatible with Natural bottles although Philips Avent's official website says they are.
Baby,2.0,Little disappointed,"I had such high hopes for these adorable things when i first saw them.My then 4mth old was just discovering his feet and i thought these would be fun. But they are so loose they come off practically by themselves.He enjoyed them when he had them on, but i really wish there was a way they had been a little snugger. I wound up giving them away"
Baby,5.0,great!,My son loves his wubanub. He can grasp it easily. It' soft. We take it everywhere we go. Helps at night.
Baby,5.0,Handy to have,"This product is exactly as described.  It is so handy to have while taking walks.  I put my cell phone, water bottle & doggie bags in it.  Plus, my daughter's sippy cup can fit too!  Its really great."
Baby,1.0,Stopped moving after a month!,The mobile stopped rotating after a month even I did not turn it on very often! ( just couple of times per day) very disappointed!
Baby,5.0,Love it,"The soothie pacifier we received from the hospital is the only one my baby will take, but he's always losing it in his carseat when I can't stop and give it back to him.  The Wubbanub is perfect because it gives him the paci he loves and allows him to hold his 'toy' and he's learning to put it back in his mouth by himself."
Baby,5.0,Love this little guy,"I have bought these pacifier/toys for each of my great-grandbabies and plan to buy them for all future additions to our family.  The mothers love them because they help the baby keep the pacifier in his/her mouth.  I have bought lots of these.....in different &#34;critters&#34; and they are all so cute and soft.  My absolute favorites are the monkey and duck, but all the ones I have bought are very cute and well loved by the babies.  I would recommend them for all new babies."
Baby,5.0,My baby loves them!,My 7 week old daughter loves these!  She smiles and interacts and wiggles like crazy with them on.  Great purchase.
Baby,5.0,My baby loves them1,My 7 week old daughter loves these!  She smiles and interacts and wiggles like crazy with them on.  Great purchase.
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,Does everything as advertised; setup complete in about 15 minutes. Easy to setup port forwarding on a netgear wireless router so everyone can view on WAN. Really like that you can customize usernames and pws for viewers. Clarity is good and there's hardly any lag on Verizon 3G.
Baby,5.0,Love it.,Aside it being adorable I can easily find it. Now that my baby is six months he shakes the monkey around too cute.
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,Great use for nap time. Gives my son something to hold onto as well as keeping it from rolling away. Still easy to clean and sanitize.
Baby,5.0,"Great, affordable product!",Bought this because i liked the price. Fits great on my Baby Jogger Summit X3!  I can fit a lot of stuff in the middle compartment.
Baby,5.0,Works on my Britax!,I wanted a cheaper cup holder than britax brand.  This fits perfectly and I like the sturdy frame. I may buy another for the other half of my double stroller handle so I can carry more things!
Baby,5.0,Love love it!!!!,I bought this pacifier for my son before he was born. I took it with me to the hospital when I went into labor. The child was attached to it as soon we offered it to him. It's easy to find and you can just throw it in the washer. I ordered him similar ones it but he prefers this on.  He's four and half months now and this is the second one I buy him.
Baby,1.0,"Awful Construction, Falls Apart, Can't Get the Wipes Out!","I wanted to love this seemingly innovative product,as I've loved Skip Hop products before, but within a few weeks of use, it was useless!<br /><br />1. The strap broke at the point that attached to the wipes container.<br />2. The red, sliding access point had popped off so many times that it no longer slid along the track well.<br />3. Bad Construction: The actual process of opening the container requires 2 strong hands and thumbs (not ideal when you're wrestling a child with a dirty diaper on a dirty bathroom diaper changing station).<br />4. Bad Construction: Pulling the wipes out causes either shredding or a whole handful of them coming out.<br /><br />Save your money, don't buy this product!"
Baby,2.0,Great Item If It Works.,"I bought this in June last year for my son. Started to use it about 2-3 months ago. We did not use it heavily. On average, we used about 2-3 hour every week. Right now, the leaves stop moving properly. It will move couple seconds, and stop like 5 or 6 minutes, and move again for couple seconds, and stop. Same thing happens even after we put new batteries in."
Baby,5.0,nice!,"The stroller we love to shop around town in had nowhere to put small stuff.  This solved the problem.  It can hold 2 bottles or sippy cups, my wallet and car keys.  I like it a lot!"
Baby,3.0,You get what you pay for,This case easily opens and does not close very well. I didn't realize it didn't close and it dried out my baby's wipes. Red sliding circle snaps off easily as well.
Baby,5.0,THX,Granddaughter already 11 months now but I'm writing a late review.  She loves bugs & eyes and enjoyed watching these on her feet!
Baby,1.0,"Eh, could have gone without","These look so cute.  When I was pregnant I bought them thinking that my son would love them.  Frankly he could not have cared less.  When he was not able to move he never noticed them.  And now that he can move he doesn't care about them.  These quickly became an impulse buy I should have avoided.  Don't get me wrong.  Super cute idea, super cute product, fun to put on your baby for you - but the baby does not need these."
Baby,5.0,Love DeeDee,"Love this product nice size, colorful with a variety of textured for baby to enjoy, crunchy, rattle and comes with a take along clip."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I needed!,This is exactly what I needed and was looking for. It fits perfect on my BJ City Micro stroller and holds things great. And you can't beat the price.
Baby,5.0,rainforest mobile,"mesmerizing for the baby and me!!<br />it is a well made, well thought out mobile. I would recommend it highly"
Baby,3.0,Just ok...,"I was under the impression that the monkey would be like a beanie baby... meaning heavier. It's really light and all the baby needs to do is move an arm and it pulls the pacifier out of her mouth. Also, the pacifier is permanently attached to the monkey which makes washing it difficult - either the monkey or the pacifier when it falls on the ground."
Baby,4.0,Really nice mobile with soothing sounds and playtime music,"My daughter really likes this mobile. It has beautiful colors, pleasant animals to look at and a remote so you can start and stop it from a distance so the baby doesn't see you -- especially as she's falling asleep. So far no problems, but it does feel kind of bulky and heavy so I have a piece of string that ties the top to the back of the crib railing. Somehow I didn't feel safe leaving it just hanging over my baby the way it is made - that's why the 4 stars."
Baby,5.0,Good product,I have three Avent bottles but sealing discs didn't come with them.  These are great and serve my needs well to be able to have a bottle that will travel well.
Baby,2.0,"Cute, but not practical","The socks don't have any elasticity in them... at all.  So when she kicks her feet they just fly off her feet.  Also, the rattle noise could be louder to get baby's attention a little better.  Wish I hadn't bought them."
Baby,3.0,Louder please!,"They fit my daughters wrists great, and they are super cute.  But they are not very loud!  They function more as funny bracelets than wrist rattles."
Baby,1.0,Very hard to clean,This item is hard to clean I have twins and this item was totally not practical.  My grandson however though liked it.
Baby,5.0,love,Our theme is monkey's so it's perfect that way and it's really cute but it also helps the baby keep the pacifier in and not just spit it out so my baby loves it and so do we.
Baby,4.0,Great wipes case for the diaper bag!,This case does a great job of keeping wipes wet that don't necessarily get used every day.  Easy to refill & easy to use--although it's not quite one-handed as advertised.  That's not a deal breaker for me as I really just wanted a travel case that would keep my wipes wet & handy.
Baby,4.0,Difficult to set up but love it after 6 months,"I bought this camera because of the IPhone app and the almost 360 degree rotation. I love the camera except that I could not figure out how to access it from outside my home wifi. I plugged away trying different port forwarding and finally got it and it is great. It should not be so hard to get the info you need but despite all the hassle, I really love the camera."
Baby,5.0,perfect,i see this being my daughter's new best friend! it is so perfect for little ones to hold onto but also soothe themselves with... genius idea!!!
Baby,5.0,On our stroller for a year!,"We use this on our Bumbleride jogging stroller and we love it! It is secure and holds two bottles of water (even the large refillable containers), two iPhones and even my large wallet. There is a small zippered section that one can put their keys (or something small) in, but we don't use it as our stroller has a great clip for keys."
Baby,5.0,for my newborn,"I have a son who is now 4 months old who absolutely loves this toy, even my two year old daughter tries to steal it from him when ever possible.  What I love is that it doesn't annoy me when they play with it, so I don't feel like I have to hide or get rid of it to save my sanity.  Plus I love playing with them in it!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"I love it but I cant figure out how to work it when im away from home. Im not sure if i have to call my cable company but something is blocked where i cant do it, other then that I love it!"
Baby,4.0,I have a love-hate relationship with this case but would buy it again,"I do not know why I am obsessed with wipes containers. It's a sickness, I know. Anyhow, I scoured the internet to find the perfect wipes container because I was sure that it was out there...and this one, though riddled with problems, is the closest that I have come to the perfect wipes container.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1) I love the design. It looks modern, contemporary and cute.<br /><br />2) The strap it contains to hang it on your stroller is awesome! It prevents me from having to dig for wipes in the bottom of my diaper bag constantly when I just need to quickly grab a wipe to clean the baby's hands.<br /><br />3) This case holds a lot of wipes, is made of strong, thick plastic and is easy to clean. I hate the thin and poorly made travel Huggies wipes cases that I have used before, which are made from flimsy cheap plastic because you can barely fit any wipes in them. In contrast, the Skip Hop wipes container allows you to store a good amount of wipes in it and its plastic case is very sturdy.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1) The red button that closes the Skip Hop wipes container is CONSTANTLY popping off! And as soon as it pops off the baby will inevitably grab the red button and throw it in a fountain or in some bushes or in some other crazy location which means that I have to hunt around for 10 minutes to find that button.<br /><br />2) When it does stay on, the red button sticks and is hard to slide from open to closed, and vice versa. So, when you are sitting there trying to change the wiggling baby with one hand and trying to open or close this wipes container with the other hand, you can just forget about it. There is no easily accessing the wipes in this container without tugging on the container and causing the red button to pop off into oblivion!<br /><br />3) Wipes tend to dry out if left in this case. The red button closure doesn't seem to seal the wipes in the case in an airtight fashion so if you leave the wipes in the case, you can go to grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe. Not fun!<br /><br />My message to Skip Hop is this: Listen, this could be a GREAT case. You just have to work on increasing the functionality of that troublesome red button and you will have an almost perfect product.<br /><br />To those considering buying this case, call me crazy, but I would still definitely buy it again! Even with some quirks, it is still the best case out there in my opinion. No other case is as stylish as the Skip Hop case, or holds as many wipes with the added bonus of clipping onto the stroller like the Skip Hop case. I just recommend being vigilant about making sure to not lose the red closing button and I recommend adding a bit of extra water to your wipes if you leave them in the case for several days as they may dry out a bit. Follow those tips and voila, you have a fabulous wipes case.o grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe.

Baby,3.0,Looks good but the sound is very feeble,It looks cute on my son's hand but it does not solve the purpose.  The rattle sound is very feeble.
Baby,5.0,A must have!,"My now 4 year old twin daughters were preemies.  They were each given a Wubbanub in the NICU.  Fast forward to 2013 and I have a new nephew born 11 weeks premature.  I just ordered him the monkey. The best thing about these are that babies, especially preemies, is that they can guide the pacifier much easier on their own, honing their hand/eye coordination.<br /><br />The big downside is that they pacifier can not be removed from the stuffed animal.  I found a couple work around's for that when my girls started crawling and got it dirty.  One is put it in the dishwasher, but the animal tends to come out still damp.  The other was just toss it in the washer with my kids clothing.  When it was all washed and dried, I simple boiled some water and sterilized the pacifier.<br /><br />My girls no longer use the pacifier, of course, but they still have them and their baby dolls \\""use\\"" them now."
Baby,4.0,Great idea!,"I really liked these when I bought them while pregnant for my daugher. She &#34;discovered&#34; her feet about 2 weeks ago, so I immediately busted these out and put them on her feet. She could care less. Infact, if I put them on her, she waits until I take them off of her to go for her toes. She just wants the real little piggies, not these. I guess it's just a risk, I'm sure some babies probably love them."
Baby,4.0,He loves it!,"My son doesnt drop his paci as much with this Wubbanub since he can hold on to the monkey... i love the idea and think it is great; however, for the price, I thought the plush toy was going to be larger.  For the price, i could have (and will) sewed the paci on to a stuffed animal myself!"
Baby,1.0,Dries wipes,This wipe holder does not keep wipes wet. The red thing also pops off extremely easily. Beyond that the holder is much bigger and bulkier than I would have thought from what looks like a sleek design. I wouldn't recommend.
Baby,1.0,Absolute Garbage,"If you don't read anything else, DON'T BUY THIS!<br /><br />I've had to tough it out with this monitor for a little over a year now.  When I first set it up around March 2012, it was ok, not perfect, but it did the job.  It has progressively gotten worse over the year.  I'm at the point now, where it doesn't even work. When I launch the app (on a good launch), I can view the room, but the loading icon just spins in front of it. I can't rotate or tilt the camera on my own, I can't even see video longer than a second before it freezes up and starts loading, and honestly, a second is being generous.  The loader rarely goes away and when it does go away, the connection is still crappy.  My house has a 50mb/s wifi connection and my wifi at work is even better than that, so there is no \\""slow connection\\"" causing these issues.  This is happening on my iPhone and my iPad.  Very frustrated and annoyed because this crap cost a pretty decent amount of money."
Baby,1.0,Useless!,"In our shopping preparing for baby, the Withings Smart Baby Monitor ended up being my biggest regret of a purchase.<br /><br />This was a splurge for my new baby's nursery. I felt I could justify the price because it was for safety. The fact that you check in on the baby from anywhere was important since my husband is away often. It seemed like a good way for him to still be connected while out of town. I also liked the thought of just using my ipad or iPhone for a monitor screen.<br /><br /> This ended up being a total waste of money. After complications with set up, we attempted to contact customer service, which was a complete joke. Discovering the problem on our own, we were up and running. The amount of delay time makes me nervous to rely on this. The delay is my biggest complaint. The app often crashes. And I have found that it makes more sense to have a monitor screen completely dedicated to the monitoring the baby- Not an ipad or iPhone, which is often being used for other tasks.<br /><br />The one thing I like about the monitor is its aesthetics. That's it. It's way too expensive for something pretty that doesn't work correctly. After spending so much money on this and still needing a working real-time monitor, I had an issue with shelling out for another expensive monitor. Our solution has been a cheap $20 monitor and FaceTime when dad is gone."
Baby,4.0,As expected,It's nothing special but it gets the job done so I would recommended it based on the great price! Great for storage!
Baby,5.0,baby loves it,this is one car toy my baby loves alot. its a must have for all our trips. would totally recommend.
Baby,5.0,Work on Classic and Natural,Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discs work on both the Classic and the Natural.  Clean easy and are slightly rubbery for a tight seal.
Baby,2.0,"Son likes to play with them, just don't on his feet","Like others have mentioned, these things do not fit my kids' feet. They are pretty useless as foot toys. Unless your kid has really tiny feet, skip this."
Baby,4.0,Awesome Mobile!,"I was looking for a mobile with lights but couldn't find any, this one gets the attention of the baby since besides having a circular motion of the puppets it brings the leaves down and up creating a blossoming effect."
Baby,2.0,Warning: maybe not compatible with lightweight strollers; check the width!,"It seems that the lightweight Chicco CT0.6 stroller (on the wide side in its category!) I have is too narrow to hold the organizer in place between the handle bars. I can't make the thing stay on the right position even with the straps tightened as far as they get. Now the buggy buddy just slides down the bars all the way only to be stopped by the canopy. It also dangles due to the lack of stability, so no way I can trust it with a cup of coffee. I wouldn't bother to return it since it's truly inexpensive; I can still throw in keys and snack packs in it. It would have been more helpful had the Amazon product description been more straightforward with its size limit. It may work fine with a standard-size stroller but be warned if you want to use it on a lightweight stroller."
Baby,2.0,Not for Britax B-Agile,"This fits the B-Agile on a slant, so beverages with holes (e.g. hot coffee) spill out onto the stroller.  Drinks with lids are ok, but the cup holders are a little small so you have to shove them in there.  It also has a weird chemical smell, like other reviewers said."
Baby,5.0,Works great for our Uppababy Vista,We bought this as an alternative to the overpriced Uppababy cupholder. It has come in very handy. We are just more careful with hot drinks when we put it in this cupholder since it is made of fabric.
Baby,4.0,Good for the Price,"I was looking for a cheap drink, keys and phone holder, and this did the trick. I wasn't blown away by it... it isn't a perfect glove fit on the stroller, it doesn't have an internal gyroscope or anything like that... but it's fine, holds drinks, holds my keys, holds my phone, and cost very little."
Baby,4.0,cute socks,"This was a gift for our niece.  She loved them, the only sad part was that they grow out of them so quickly.  They were exactly what we expected them to be...noisy play toys!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy,"This quickly became my 4 month olds favorite toy, now 2 months later it still is.  Great textures and sounds.  I would recommend to anyone."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,I had a wipes case but it always dried out my wipes.  This is perfect because it keeps the wipes moist and you can attach it to the stroller or outside of a diaper bag easily.
Baby,5.0,Great for staying in the little one's mouth!,"I wanted this pacifier mainly because it was so darn cute, but wow, it is GREAT at staying in my 1 month old's mouth!  His other pacifiers pop out once he gets sleepy and that wakes him up, but the plush animal on this one allows the pacifier to stay in position.  We've started saying \\""the monkey understands\\"" because it is often the only thing that will settle him down in his car seat or in bed before he falls asleep.  Plus, it looks really cute.  Definitely get this."
Baby,5.0,baby's favorite,"He loves his little monkey paci.  He can find it in the crib at night much easier than the standard paci, and loves playing with the little monkey even if he's not using the attached pacifier."
Baby,4.0,returned it.,"We like this one but it didn't fit on our crib.  our crib has thicker rail. this is our crip. we didn't buy at this website tho.  [...]  anyway, whoever has thicker rail like that it wouldn't fit.  we tried to return but once you snapped the leaves in then we couln't take off, which means we coudln't put them in the box. so we contacted fisher price and it was fine to send only base. and we did and got vourcher."
Baby,5.0,Colorfull,"Bought this for my 3 month old baby boy. He has to have some type of background noise or music to fall asleep to and he loves this mobile. I had a wined up mobile previously but it was too loud and would startle him or keep him awake. This one, however, has volume settings that are perfect for night time. He loves to watch the animals spin around and tries to reach for them. He is now 8 months old and still has to have it on every night before he falls asleep. Perfect product for my baby boy."
Baby,1.0,"SHAME ON YOU, iBABY LABS!","Who runs this company? Your customers are parents of babies, people who would love to be able to reliably monitor their child - as your marketing claims your product will do - and be able to get much needed sleep without interruptions from their so-called baby monitor. Yes, the camera is good but the software app is ridiculously amateur. The updates have been a joke. \\""Bug fixes\\""!? More like \\""bug additions\\""! This product has gone from barely usable to totally useless. All these people complaining about the same things aren't idiots with bad equipment. Sound levels randomly increasing and decreasing, \\""popping\\"" over the speakers, disconnects every few hours, necessitating a restart in the middle of the night. Do you read these reviews and the problems people are having? Do you test anything? Are your programmers infants themselves or do you just not care?! The iBABY has been riddled with problems since its release, and this company's failure to supply adequate functioning software and supply customer support beyond the unintelligible level of the included instructions warrants a LAWSUIT.  EPIC FAIL on APPLE for promoting this product and allowing updates to be released that render the software in WORSE condition than before! Buy this product if you enjoy wasting hours troubleshooting at great expense."
Baby,4.0,Depends on the baby,"I think these are such a great idea! I put these on my daughter as soon as she &#34;noticed&#34; her hands. She's now 4 months old, and I still bust these out, probably once a week. They fit just fine around her chubby wrists, but she really doesn't have any interest in them. Once she fell asleep with them on and they kept waking her up. She's more interested in them when they aren't attached to her. So basically, you don't know until you try. But the contrasting colors and rattle noise definitely catch her attention, just not while they're attached to her."
Baby,5.0,"The one toy we give to every new parent, PLUS donate at Christmas...","We adore this giraffe because our son adores it.  Around 6 weeks he could focus on the giraffe and stared at it, especially the black and white foot.  Next came the discovery of the mirror, and for a good two months he'd entertain himself with that foot.  Then he began tugging on the ring, following by gumming all the feet.  At nine months he still whacks the giraffe, babbles to it, moves it around, and overall just really enjoys his toy.  He is distraught when traveling without this toy and will fuss until it's on the seat--even if he then ignores it.<br /><br />We now give this to all new parents and donated a few at Christmastime.  It's a great toy that covers multiple stages of your baby, and for $9 you cover the whole car seat toy thing."
Baby,5.0,HUGE timesaver!!,"No need to pump in one cup and transfer to the baby's bottle- just pump into the advent bottle and use these to securely seal with rings that usually hold the nipples.  This saved me an enormous amount of time and kept me from washing a million dishes!  If you are determined to breastfeed for at least 12 months and have to work/pump a lot, these are a must!!  I used with the breastpump conversion kit and it was a lifesaver!"
Baby,5.0,BPA free! Happy with durability and attachable strap,I love that this is BPA free! Happy with durability and attachable strap. Good product at a reasonable price. It has served me well.
Baby,5.0,Very Good Product,This was shipped very fast and the product is perfect for Tummy Time and playing on back. My baby (3 months old) loves the tiger that makes sound and can hit the ball making the sound on his own. If you are looking for a toy to help development this is a great one to choose! Tummy Time for my baby became more fun because of the mirror and the rattle ball built in.
Baby,2.0,"Great marketing, not so great product","Video quality doesn't even come close to HD quality. The quality seems to depend largely on the lighting in the room. Even the slightest change in lighting often makes the picture quality terrible. I haven't been able to get video quality that's even close to the images used on the WiThings website and/or marketing material. I even upgraded my home internet speeds to 25M download / 5M upload and the quality is still sub-par.<br /><br />No way to turn off the night-mode lights so in dimly lit rooms the light keeps turning on and off making it impossible to watch.<br /><br />All of video/audio streams are passing through WiThings servers rather than allowing the apps to talk directly to the baby monitor. I think it's also the reason for a lot of the picture quality problems. If I'm at home why do I need to send my video/audio out of my internet connection to WiThings servers just to download it back to my iPad in the same home? Connecting via Bluetooth isn't a solution unless you live in a small 1 bedroom apartment. I understand that by doing this it makes the monitor more plug-and-play for average users but why not offer the option to stream directly from your monitor?<br /><br />Customer support is terrible. Rather than offering to help I've gotten responses that tell me to return the product if I'm not satisfied.<br /><br />The crib clip is not adjustable and will not fit most newer cribs. Again, I asked about a larger clip and WiThings suggested I return the unit if I wasn't happy.<br /><br />WiThings indicated that viewing the monitor on a computer was coming soon and that was almost a year ago. Still no PC/Mac support.<br /><br />The only positive thing I have to say about this is that it looks very nice. Aside from that I regret choosing this over some of the other options."
Baby,5.0,The perfect pacifier for my son,"My son hates the single pacifier with nothing hanging onto it. So I tried this monkey pacifier and he immediately fell in love with it. He sucks on it during nap and sleep time. It's also a lifesaver for us new parents when he cries in the middle of the night. I just pop this pacifier back in and he will fall back asleep. As of today, my son is 12 months and still uses it. He now grabs it himself in the middle of the night and put himself back to sleep. My son's favorite pacifier and buddy."
Baby,4.0,Life Saver,She is almost a year and still loves it ! :) The Batteries last very long as well. I would highly recommend this ! :)
Baby,5.0,Wonderful Toy for your little one,"This is a great addition to any play gym, stroller or car seat. I bought it when he was 4 months old and now at 8 months he's still playing with it."
Baby,5.0,Keeps me organized,"This item fits my mountain buggy stroller perfectly.  It is sturdy enough that my drinks don't spill but soft enough to fit lots of stuff.  With 3 young, active kids that's a must!"
Baby,4.0,Good for the price,"I got this for my BJ city micro. It's easy to Velcro on, but the nature if the stroller handle bar doesn't allow for it to sit completely flat. So beware when putting in beverages that it does tilt a little.  Overall I like it."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"I think this was a brilliant idea! Babies not only like the pacifier, but the limbs of the animals help out during teething. I also think that by chewing and sucking on the limbs and not just the pacifier will help when it's time to say good bye to the paci."
Baby,5.0,Love it,A fraction of the price of the actual britax ones.  Serves the same purpose but does it better.  Recommend highly.
Baby,5.0,Love this!,"I bought this organizer for my city mini. It's perfect and a fraction of the price of the baby jogger brand. Cup holders are big, love the zipper compartment and I have plenty of room for my keys, wallet and snack. It fits my stroller perfectly and I keep it attached when I fold the stroller with no issue."
Baby,5.0,great stuff,"This is the best of its category by far after looking extensively on the web. image quality is excellent,installation easy. to be able to bring it to friends withtou having to take the charger (works on battery for 2hours) is great."
Baby,3.0,You get what you pay for,"For the cost, its a cute buy. My daughter loves to play since , Daddy plays. The strings don't stay tight or hold tune, which is fine since she can't play anyhow. We are also currently down to 2 strings. We knew she would beat it up, that is why we went with cute and cheap, not function. She really enjoys it at 20 months old."
Baby,5.0,Good quality,"This package arrived earlier than expected, is easy to put together, and provides my grandchild with enjoyment. I recommend it for anyone who wants a crib mobile."
Baby,5.0,cute,"there are a lot of &#34;sensory&#34; toys that babies could really care less about, but this toy get covered in more drool and slobber than any other in the house. great product, built to last."
Baby,5.0,"Great product, great price!","This buggy stroller organizer works wonderfully and can hold water bottles, cups, and etc. as well as keys, phone, wallet in the caddy. You can't beat the price either! I've tried a few other stroller organizers (JL Childress, and Munchkin) and this is definitely the best to use with our Maclaren strollers."
Baby,4.0,It was a gift.,"We haven't used this yet, Im sure it will come in very handy with the new baby coming. My Daughter loves it."
Baby,4.0,No brainer,Met my expectations.<br />If this is want to want you will be satisfied.<br />Item just as described. It is just what it is .
Baby,5.0,Great for my britax b agile,It is great and good price I love it and it work just right for my Britax B-Agile stroller. I was looking for one other than the one that is for that stroller but lower price and I am glad i found this
Baby,5.0,Adorable!,The monkey is my son's favorite wubbanub.  We have several as they are all that he will use.  Just love them.
Baby,4.0,Surprisingly good,Works quite well once you get it set up.  PITA to initially configure as their original shipping firmware would NOT log onto most modern WiFi networks requiring a hardwire ethernet connection overnight in order for it to update.<br /><br />Once that craziness was over works very reliably.  Not perfect but very good for the price.
Baby,2.0,"Low battery life, weak app response","Set up was very simple for both Android and iOS apps.<br />iOS better but still not perfect. Keeps refreshing. Have only tested with within home network.<br />Android support is weak. Tested out of home network and was disappointed.<br />Even within home network, static image and time lag.<br />Overall this could be a much better product.<br />Price not justified but not many options available for wifi monitoring. Surprising in today's commercial times."
Baby,5.0,We don't go anywhere without it.,"This little guy goes everywhere with us. Even though my son has stopped taking a pacifier I still stick him in the car seat with him. In fact, he is in his bed right now. I think I might even remove the pacifier eventually and hand sew him back up. I highly recommend this product."
Baby,3.0,Really cute. But baby can take it off too easily.,"I saw an article recommending this product then I ordered it immediately. They're really adorable and made from great concept. One of my cousin who was pregnant told me she'd like to have them, too.<br /><br />But they're not like socks which have a &#34;foot shape&#34; to help with fitting. They're not easy to put on, but quite easy for baby to pull them off."
Baby,5.0,Best Mobile Ever Made,"I actually bought this mobile from a garage sale for $5.00 not knowing if it even worked. My first son had horrible acid reflux and this was the ONLY thing that soothed him. We have a crib w/ attached changing table and we have the mobile on the crib so he can see it from the changing table. We used this mobile until he was close to 18 months old (he learned how to turn it on himself and would put himself to sleep with it). Now with my second son same story, he is very colicky and he absolutely loves this mobile, he will sit and watch it and stop crying instantly when it is turned on. I am tempted to buy another one just to have one in our living room too!"
Baby,5.0,Great,Fits my Chicco Liteway perfectly! Also holds my huge water bottle just fine. Super happy with it. It should fit most strollers on the market since the velcro parts that hold it on are adjustable.
Baby,5.0,baby stoller stuff,The items look like they will do the trick b ut I havn't got to use them much as there is lots of snow outside and going for strollers rides are very cold.  thanks a lot nat. P. S i purchsed this item a amazon
Baby,5.0,Perfect for stroller!,"This fits perfectly on our Graco Mickey Mouse stroller! I don't know what I was thinking getting a stroller with no child tray or parent tray. We used this yesterday for the first time, at our trip to the zoo. It held two drinks(Playtex 9oz sippy cup, and Gatorade bottle) with no problem. In the middle I put a snack cup and two sandwiches in with the bottles and it held perfectly! It is smaller than what it looks like from the picture, but it is more than I could of asked for especially for the price. I can't wait to use it on our trip to Disney in a couple months. It is definitely worth the money, and I would highly recommend it! I am actually thinking of getting one to use a child tray since it was smaller in size than I expected."
Baby,1.0,"Terrible, do not buy for Bug Cameleon",This Organizer is so annoying. It is driving me and husband crazy. The velcro straps keep slipping and go all crooked and forget having a small cup of coffee with top on- sloshes all over. This was a waste of my money so I am looking into a better one for my Bug Cam.
Baby,4.0,My son loved this in his carseat,Great little toy for what it is. Soft and interesting to young children. We used it often when we took him anywhere. Fits on strollers well too - lets you latch it to something so it doesn't fly when it gets inevitably tossed.
Baby,5.0,Works great.,"Works great as extra storage on my stroller. I think this would probably fit on any stroller. Straps on with quality Velcro and has a small zippered pocket as well as space for two drinks, wallet and cell phone. Happy with my purchase!"
Baby,5.0,:) Happy Baby Happy Momma !,My son absolutly loves this and wont use any other passie !!!<br />No Complaints !!!<br />No Regrets !<br />It is made well !
Baby,5.0,Thinking about getting another!,Little one loves it and even we love it too!  Our 3 month old was able to grab around the monkey.  I would so get it as a shower gift for all of my family and friends.  It's a must have!
Baby,5.0,Get this!,"I love this thing!!!! It allows me to eat breakfast every morning, keeps my little girl very occupied for 20-30 min. Then when she's tired she falls asleep below it with the rainforest noise. This is by far her favorite toy we own. It's totally worth the money if you are looking for something to keep your child busy so you can get stuff done!!!"
Baby,5.0,it was for my niece,"she abolstely loves this pacifier, even everyone is the hospital where she born wanted to know where i got it so they can buy them"
Baby,5.0,dragon,As a grandmother I saw this and it fit my grandson.  Nice colors and texture. It is a good size too
Baby,5.0,It's awesome to be able to see AND talk and listen and talk to my pets!!,This camera is very dependable and now that I have it I can't live without it! It's easy to set up and it really makes me feel good to be able to stay in touch with my pets no matter where I am! I have the app on my iPhone and both iPads. It can also be used in the car. I have my two puppies in a crate and can watch and hear them while in restaurants. Love it!!!
Baby,4.0,Cute,"My daughter loves this thing, which is the most important feature to me. I think it could be a little biggerto make it easier for a baby to hug. Also, I wish you could change out the pacifiers in order to clean them. I usually toss hers in the sterilizer at the end of the day."
Baby,3.0,"it's ok, there may be better out there.","I think this product is just OK, i have other skip hop products (including the bento diaper bag which i love), but this<br />doesnt make me as appy.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />It's slim and fits easily into my diaper bag<br />It's easy to fill with wipes<br />It's made of sturdy plastic<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's not easy to open (definitely couldn't do it one handed whilst holding baby in place)<br />The red tab comes off and is pretty difficult to get back on<br />The wipes dry out after a couple of days"
Baby,5.0,Yesss!!!!!,"We attached this to our small stroller for our Disneyland trip. Two adults, 1.5 year old, 4 year old and 14 year old. So we needed a lot of cup holders because it was hot. This worked great. It held our smart water bottles and sippy cups. No issues with the bottles or cups falling out. Almost eveything fits.. even some large cups for soft drinks. We never took it off and use it all the time."
Baby,5.0,grandbaby's favorite,"i bought this for my grandson's first x-mas present. colorful, entertaining, engaging. grandbaby played with this for a long time and even now, five months later, he still plays with this friendly little dragon."
Baby,3.0,overrated,camera resolution is good but there is quite a lag on data transmission. sensors are not very sensitive. worst of all battery life is extremely inadequate
Baby,5.0,LOVE it!!,"This is the perfect addition to my name brand jogging stroller!  It has the right amount of space for my keys, my cell phone, a couple sippy cups, and some odds and ends as needed.  Attaches really easily.  I highly recommend it!"
Baby,4.0,Good ..,it is good mobile ..  I was expecting maybe a couple of lights at top ( moving  part ) but is does the job ..
Baby,4.0,i have the UppaBaby Vista,I installed this Organizer onto the UppaBaby Vista Stroller.  The handles on the Vista are very wide which exceeds the installation width of this Organizer.  Otherwise I really like this Diono item and I assume that it fits onto the majority of some other strollers.  I recommend!
Baby,3.0,As Described,The item is as described.it is recommended for any who is interested.it I is worth the money.buy it as it is a high quality item
Baby,1.0,Dried out wipes,"I wanted this because of the strap and easy access to the wipes via the red slide button.  However, it is large and bulky and when strapped to my diaper bag, it bangs against it loudly.  Worst of all, it dried out my wipes in just a few days.  Yes, the slide button was closed all the way.  Very disappointed."
Baby,5.0,Good buy,"Bought this to use to with our Baby Jogger since the BJ doesn't come with a parent console to put my cell phone, drink, keys etc.  It is great.  There is no zipper section to this, but that's ok.  It's made of all fabric, so I was concerned about how it would handle stabilizing a drink, but the elastic is so strong to hold it in place and so far I haven't had a problem.  I actually like this better than the hard plastic parent console I have on my old Graco stroller. Time will tell how well the elastic holds out, but at this price even if it only lasted me a few years I'd purchase another to replace it."
Baby,5.0,LIFESAVER,"Initially my son did not take to pacifiers at all, but I did not want him to be a thumb sucker.  So I bought this at 4 months old and almost tossed it.  Decided to keep it and BOY am I glad I did!! He goes everywhere with monkey.  At night, if he wakes, he'll cry a bit and tos around and he can find him so much easier than a plain pacifier and plop him right back in his mouth for a good nights rest.  He loves \\""monkey\\"" and so do we!!"
Baby,5.0,Used with City Select,"I am using this stroller organizer with my City Select stroller. I have the second seat option along with the glider board. I like this stroller organizer because I am able to adjust the location of it depending on if my older toddler is using the glider board or the seat. Just the other day we went to an amusement park and it worked perfectly for our needs. I was able to put a pack of wipes in the center console along with antibacterial soap. My hubby and I each had a cup holder, which was a plus since the Baby Jogger version on a stroller organizer only had 1 cup holder. I am also able to fold the stroller without removing this unit. It is a great value and fits our needs."
Baby,1.0,2nd monitor  - broken,"This is the second ibaby M3 monitor we've purchased that does not work... THe first had internal problems (according to their tech-support).  We wanted to give the monitor a second chance, however, we are having the same issues the 2nd time around.  The set up SEEMS simple but never works... disappointed"
Baby,5.0,Very nice monitor,Nice monitor with the possibility of panning in and out and changing angles of view from your iPhone. Lullaby is cute and good to fall asleep with. And you can speak with your child through the monitor while away.<br />The batteries should last longer though when not plugged in wall.
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,"I bought an umbrella stroller from Target (for quick trips).  I needed something to hold sippy cups, phone, keys and such.  I was a little apprehensive at first to purchase this organizer (thinking the organizer would be too big for the umbrella stroller), but this product fits perfectly on the umbrella stroller and holds all the sippy cups (even my drink cup) well.  It feels sturdy and detaches easily when I fold down the stroller.  Well worth the $9 paid."
Baby,4.0,"Great Baby Monitor! Used For A Year Now, Use It Daily","I found this to be the most usable monitor since my wife and I have iPhones and an iPad to be able to use as monitor screens and speakers paired to the camera when I first bought it. Setup was not as easy as the marketing made it out to be, but I believe this to be due to when I bought it the software was still be hammered out.<br /><br />The first 2 months were hit and miss if the software would stay running over night or not which was not very helpful for my sleep schedule. After a few updates though, the iBaby is a wonderful monitor system. My only regret now is the sound it makes when the app is running and my battery on my iOS device is running low around 20% or less, it's very annoying to say the least and doesn't stop (a safety feature I'm sure).<br /><br />I have already recommended this monitor to several friends that are expecting and will continue to do so."
Baby,4.0,Daughter loved it!,"I was pleased with this mobile. It did the job. It was however a bit rough to install. I had to cut a hole in a washcloth & place it between the mobile and crib so that the attachment wheel wouldn't scrape against the wood crib.<br /><br />I loved the remote feature, it was nice to be able to turn it on for a second cycle without entering my daughters room!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my BOB,"Highly recommended for a BOB revolution jogging stroller. No need to pay the extra $$ to get one with the BOB name on it, this works perfectly."
Baby,5.0,Cute as could be!,I got this for my niece's baby shower and she absolutely loved it! It was the one of a kind!!
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it,He is 4 months old and he really enjoys playing with this toy. It is his favorite toy right now.
Baby,5.0,Great buy!,"My baby girl likes it a lot. She can get bored with other toys, but with Dee Dee she can play all the time."
Baby,5.0,Love it!!!,My daughter loved it as a mobile and now even better as a music box. She loved it so much she would wake up to turn on the sounds in the middle of the night! We have since taken it out of her crib and she happily listens to it while she falls asleep for naps and bedtime. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
Baby,1.0,WARNING!! Don't buy this.,"I thought this was a really cute mobile and had to have it. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. First off, it is a resource hog using 4-D batteries and 2 AA batteries which need replaced way too often. After using it for only 4 days without anything to obstruct the movements, the mobile stopped turning and would only play music. I returned it and the replacement only worked for a week before making an aweful squeaking sound as it rotated (crickets. Very loud obnoxious crickets.) I again returned it to toys r us. The 3rd one lasted a whopping 3 weeks before making the same squeaking sound. I am completely astonished at the poor craftsmanship coming from Fisher price these days, but this mobile takes the cake."
Baby,4.0,Helps Keep Paci In,"Unfortunately, our little guy doesn't really take a pacifier, but this would definitely help to keep it in/near his mouth if he did want the paci. I don't think I'd feel comfortable putting him to bed with this toy (early on, at least), but it's great for in the swing, car seat, etc."
Baby,5.0,Baby Shower Gift,"I saw a picture of my new niece with wrist rattles and thought, that's a good idea.  So I ordered these for a shower that I'm attending.  These are so soft and well made.  I'm going to arrange leaves inside the box with these little creatures on them."
Baby,5.0,Excellent crib mobile,"We had purchased a different mobile first, and had to exchange it because when the animals turned, they got stuck against the back of the mobile. We didn't have that problem at all with this one. The animals turn just fine, the music sounds great and our daughter loves it. There are settings so you can have just the mobile, just the music, or both. At night, we just use the music for her to soothe her to sleep. For naptime and other times, we'll use the mobile. It is a nice feature. The music plays for a good amount of time and the four different options are good."
Baby,5.0,Simple and Effective,"I actually like that this is detachable.  This does the job, and I love the price.  I don't understand why most cup holders are so expensive.  This does the job, and since the material is soft, and not hard plastic, the drinks actually don't bump up and down, and I don't feel the need to constantly hold my drink down when going over bumps, etc.  Exactly what I was looking for!"
Baby,4.0,Great purchase!!!,We bought the old version because we couldn't wait for the new one coming up this year. And honestly has become one of the great purchase of the year. I'm outside of the house quite often for work and to be able to see my son and my wife thru the app it's awesome!! I guess the only thing will be that once a month we have to unplugged and plugged again because is unable to connect to wifi.
Baby,5.0,"No Longer a Slave to the ""Binky""","My infant does not want to go to sleep.  I am convinced he purposely spits out his pacifier in a last ditch attempt to wake himself up.  I tried the Wubbanub hoping it would make it harder for him to spit it out.  IT REALLY WORKS.  My infant spits out the pacifier, but it is positioned right on his chest, so he can get it back in his mouth!  It is wonderful.  Granted, it doesn't work 100% of the time, especially when he starts rocking in his swaddle, but it has made bedtime so much more easier.  This is a must for parents with infants."
Baby,4.0,Daughter loves her dragon,"Bought this for my daughter because she was born in the year of the dragon. She is now 8 months old and loves this toy. Her favorite part is the mirror on the tail. I do have to monitor her when she plays with it and make sure she can't throw it around because there is a rattle that hangs from one hand and it hurts when it gets going (i know, i was at the receiving end of it). If your baby is at the &#34;toss everything around&#34; stage of life, then consider cutting the rattle off or keep a close eye when your little one plays with it."
Baby,5.0,One of many,My daughter absolutely loves these things.  Pretty steap price for a pacifier but she loves them.  One for the mouth and two more to stick her index finger into the binky. She is 2 yrs old and i have had a supply of these around since birth.
Baby,3.0,I thought my granddaughter would like these more,"Well, I got these thinking she'd love them but, when I put them on her arm, she just looked at them & started reaching for something else."
Baby,5.0,Grand baby loves it,Makes it so much easier for babies to play with stuffed animal and suck on their bin kite at the same time.
Baby,5.0,Monkey pacifier is adorable.,This infant pacifier meets and exceeds all of my wishes. Easy for a baby to hold and makes it easy to find it when misplaced. Quality made.
Baby,5.0,Wubba Nub,"My grandson still uses this at 10 months to gum as he is teething. Very soft, easy to find, very affordable for the length of time using"
Baby,5.0,Interesting,"It's a cute toy and my daughter likes it, but it wasnt super amusing to her. Maybe she is just hard to entertain, but it's still cute. she did like the little mock mirror so she could look at herself."
Baby,5.0,Super price and fits baby jogger city mini,"As another reviewer mentioned, this fits our city mini and the cost was a major factor, at $6, it was a steal and comes in handy for walking around outside in the sun in Hawaii."
Baby,5.0,Installed on our baby jogger,What a perfect solution. Great price. and to top it off it's insulated so your drinks stay cold. Much better price than the baby jogger accessory that does the same thing.
Baby,5.0,Love,"These pacifiers are so great, they are the only ones my little guy will use!<br />perfect for car trips because they don't fall behind them in the seat when they spit them out.<br />Especially when he gets upset in the car he hugs onto the stuffed animal part, and it clams him down.<br />also it's much esier to find in the diaper bag than those tiny pacifers that fall to the bottom and get all gross.<br />my advice is get several... and keep in every room!"
Baby,5.0,A must have if you use Avent bottles,These are a must have if you use Avent bottles. They are great for storing breast milk in the fridge or freezer. They're also good for on the go.
Baby,5.0,My daughter loves it,My daughter has been drawn to this from about three months on. She is now almost eight months and still loves to watch the mobile. The music is nice too.
Baby,4.0,Great Product,"I am not sure why this gets such a range of reviews from awful to great. I received from my sister as a baby gift and she was not sure from the questionable reviews but after I set it up in about 10 minutes it works great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars was the lack of a speaker, I think that would be a nice touch and temperature reading. Other than that I would highly recommend, easy to set up and use."
Baby,5.0,Excellent Baby Monitor especially with multiple kids,"I have two of these.  I bought the first one a couple of years ago for our first child and now we have another child and need for another monitor. This monitor is really easy to use.  Not sure about the problems people are having, but it works great for OSX or for Windows.  For OSX you can use any device or you can use any web browser.  The included IPTool will look for your device on OSX and then launch the web browser with the ip address and port you set up.  It works great.  Also, since I have multiple monitors, I can switch easily between them on my iphones, ipads, or templates.  I can also access my monitors anywhere by using the DDNS address (on the bottom of the camera) using any browser, so you don't even need the software to give your relatives access.  One thing to keep in mind is that the access is not encrypted via [...]  When you use it in house, your encryption is done via your wireless settings...  The directions are a bit weird, but not hard if you have any technical ability.  Even so, a few tips:<br /><br />1. When you set your camera up, make your IP address static.  That way, your port and address are set.  DHCP takes time, and so does the registry for DDNS, so this might frustrate some people going from wired to wireless. Setting it to static will keep everything, well, static and you won't have to wait for the camera to setup and everything else to update.<br />2. You will need to reboot the device (unplug) when going from wired to wireless so that it resets the connection.  When it does not detect a wired connection, it will then go to wireless.<br />3. To switch back and forth between the two devices, hit the setup button on the IOS device to switch.  On any machine, just open a new tab in the browser with the correct ip settings...something like either [...] <<-replace here with valid information.<br /><br />It does not tell temperature or humidity.  It does:<br /><br />1. Monitor in darkness or light<br />2. Passthrough audio (you cannot speak into it - no two way comm)<br />3. Movement alerts<br />4. Connections to passthrough audio<br />5. Connections to home alarm system<br />6. dynamic DNS service to access anywhere if your router supports uPnP<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Setup<br />2. Access anywhere with any platform<br />3. Multiple monitors are easily managed<br />4. Flexible config<br />5. Audio monitoring<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Requires some technical knowledge<br />2. No temperature gauge (maybe???)<br />3. No two way audio native but through 1/8\\"" jacks in the back<br />4. No music passthrough<br /><br />In any case, it works terrific.  As I mentioned, I have two of these and it's really convenient.  I have had the Sony and the Phillips and some others.  Temp guage is important, but I have a more accurate one in the infant room.  I've noticed the baby monitor temp gauges are usually off by anywhere from 3-11 degrees, so I didn't find it useful - just panic causing (omg the baby's room is 85 degrees!!! - nope, the monitor was just plain wrong...)...<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my uppa baby vista!,"I was really wanting a drink holder for my uppa baby vista, but the one that uppa baby makes has terrible reviews and its fairly pricey. I love that this organizer fits my stroller, has multiple cup holders and a zip pocket. This eliminates me having to bring a purse on long outings, all I need to do is toss some cash, my phone and keys into the organizer and we're good to go!"
Baby,5.0,Love this!,"Our 2 month old daughter loves this binky as its one of the only kinds she will take.  It's also much easier for us to keep track of. She is beginning to be able to hold onto the toy now as well, which is nice."
Baby,5.0,The Babies Love It,Bought the giraffe and the zebra for my great-granddaughter and granddaughter.  They both love them and play with them all the time on their tummy-time mats.  A lot of different things to stimulate them.
Baby,5.0,Pacifier,too cute for words! I actually ordered several of these. Love them! The pacifier are removable for easy clean up.
Baby,5.0,Super cute,Super cute and well made I gave it as a gift and her baby will love it.  Definitely recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Love this,"This fits really well on our city mini.  It works well for keys, pacifiers, burp clothes, sunglasses, toys and a soda for mom.  The holder we had on our old stroller always caused the liquid to spill.  This seems to work much better."
Baby,5.0,Adorable,"I bought this as a gift, absolutely love it! Such an adorable toy. Perfect for a boy or a girl."
Baby,5.0,love!,my son just loves this! He is 2 months old and greatly prefers it to a regular soothie. It's also super cute!
Baby,3.0,Review for BABY JOGGER CITY SELECT,"This is made very well and works great. However, if you are using the Baby Jogger City Select stroller and are using it with TWO infant seats (with adapters) than this will not work for you; especially if you want to use the cup holder. Eventually when i use my actual stroller seats and not the infant seats this will work but right now i can't use it because the infant seat gets in the way.<br /><br /> So this review is more for moms of TWINS."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what we needed,"Just what I wanted for our Disney trip!  Something to hold a couple drinks and a place to put my phone.<br />It fit perfect on our Bumbleride Indie stroller. Well, I cant imagine that it wouldnt fit fine on ANY kind of stroller.<br />The way it straps on makes it pretty universal.  The drink compartments are elastic material so they will stretch to fit pretty big drinks. And the zipper compartment was the perfect size for an iphone 5, some loose $1's and disney passes, or whatever you might wanna stick in there.  : )"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Very easy to install, I love the fact that it has a zippered pocket were you can put some change, an ID...."
Baby,1.0,Skip Hop Wipes Case,"This thing is a waste of money. It's bulky, and I honesty don't care if it clips to the stroller... My diaper bag clips to my stroller and guess what, I can take wipes out of my diaper bag when I need them. Also it does not stay closed and even if it is closed, I found that my wipes were drying out in it. Let me save you first time moms some trouble... A ziplock bag makes an excellent &#34;wipes case&#34;. This is another one of those baby products that you don't really need."
Baby,5.0,Son born year of dragon,Not able to find this locally but was shipped from the UK and arrived in 4 days!  My son was born the year of the dragon and loves the other Lamaze toys.  He loves this one as well.  Safe for children under 1.
Baby,4.0,Great!,Great for keys and other items but the sides where the cups are supposed to go into is no good at all!  Don't expect to be able to put drinks in there!
Baby,5.0,Great for Citiy Select!,"After tons of research, I was happy to find this stroller organizer.  It's a great price and works well!  The bottle holders are stretchy to accommodate most bottle sizes.  The zipper pocket on the inside is an added bonus!"
Baby,5.0,Little man loves his Wubbanub!,Greatest invention for my guy.  My little one had a terrible time trying to keep paci's in his mouth and was sitting them out and getting frustrated.  At 2 months he spits this out but can grab and re-stick back in. Washed it in the dishwasher without any issue.
Baby,1.0,Stops working after 3 weeks,"The product is beautiful but it has some major setbacks, first it uses a lot of batteries, but the most important is that the mechanism in the mobile is very poor quality so after 3 weeks of use it stopped moving, it seemed like the little engine did not have enough power to lift the leaves, this is very disappointing coming from a major brand like Fisher Price."
Baby,3.0,For a new born!,It´s ok for a new born but for my 5 months old its too soft. I bought it for him to sleep at night and hold on to something (he love to have something for comforting) but this item never work. My recommend is to buy it for 0-3 mos.
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"I brought this plush toy pacifier for my daughter. Shes a bit over month but this monkey has become her best friend. The pacifier is a regular soothie pacifier that is suitable for 0-3 months. We put the pacifier in her month and the plush toy rests on her chest.<br />My wife was very concerned with the toy laying on the babies chest, and being to heavy for her. When we got it the toy weight barely anything, so its absolutely safe to lay on the babies chest.<br />To clean the toy we just use Purell sanitizing wipes that we just wipe the toy down with and then we take a warm damp cloth and wipe it down again. To clean the pacifier we just boil water, put it into a cup and holder the soothie in there for about 1-2 minutes.<br />I would definitely recommend this to any parents.<br />Oh and it also makes for great & cute pictures of the baby with the pacifier."
Baby,4.0,Good deal,"I really like this case, however its a bit cumbersome. It could be a little more compact. The red slide tends to fall off as well, but it is easily fixable."
Baby,5.0,Absolute favorite!,This has become my son's absolute favorite toy! He started out with the crinkling feet when he was just a few weeks old and still loves to chew on the rings on the tail now that he's nearly 8 months old. It goes with him everywhere and keeps him entertained on car trips.
Baby,4.0,anyone have problems with the leaves not going down??,I love this mobile but I have noticed that from the beginning the leaves have trouble coming back up after going down. So the whole thing stops. Has anyone else experianced this problem? I thought about maybe it was the batteries but it happened from the start with new batteries in it! Other than that I love it and my son really likes it too!
Baby,5.0,Best pacifier,"My son loves his Wubbanub, I have two now and will order another one. They are great in the case they wake up at night and have to search for it."
Baby,5.0,Great for City Mini Stroller!,"When you first get this product, let it air out for a day or two. It had such a strong chemical smell! Very odd. But, works great on the City Mini and has held up great so far (about a month)"
Baby,5.0,"excellent, very useful","do the job, easy to clean and fits the Avent products set.<br />the price is also very cheap<br />recommend it,"
Baby,5.0,Fisher price rainforest peek a boo,"The product was in excelent conditions, really nice, y bought and all the terms were right. my child will love it"
Baby,5.0,I even use it on my bycicle!!,"Extremely HANDY.... fits on just about anything, and since its structure is made of hard wire, it bends and molds to whatever you have.  Really nice option to add to any stroller that doesn't come with a cup holder.  As a matter of fact, I use it on my Uppa Baby stroller, because the cup holders they offered was REEEAAALLLy expensive, and I felt I had already payed enough on the stroller itself.  I also use this product on a Mia Mode stroller."
Baby,3.0,Just okay.,"I don't know what all the hype was about this. Our boy didn't take it at all. The pacifier wasn't orthopedic. So hard to keep clean as there's no cap for it. Once it's dirty you have to wash the entire thing, including plush toy. Wish it had an option to insert a new pacifier."
Baby,5.0,Perfect addition to my stroller.,"I own a Phil and Ted classic stroller with double attachment, and while I love my stroller, it offers few bells and whistles. The customizable options for high end strollers can be rather expensive, so I was looking for an alternative to use as a cup holder for my stroller. This little caddy is an excellent value, very sturdy, and holds two drinks plus keys, wallet, and other odds and ends. I think it would fit any stroller very easily.  (Other reviewers are spot on about the strong chemical smell... You may want to let it air out before using... Preferably outdoors.)"
Baby,4.0,Okay2 lah...,Everything is fine... the delivery time taken is very fast. The storage of the wet wipes is limited. Only that the compartment (the length) is huge. Way too long.
Baby,5.0,Fits baby jogger summit x3,this fits my new baby jogger summit x3 perfectly and is a less expensive option than the brand name suggested cup holder. The zipper pocket is also very handy.
Baby,4.0,Great product,This is the second one I have purchased. I had one for my first son and now one for my second. I am having a few issues with the remote but didn't on the previous one. Fisher price is really good about replacing items if the malfunction so I am not worried about it. Even with the remote problems it is still a great mobile.
Baby,5.0,Solid product,Best wipes case I've found. Wipes don't easily dry out and very convenient to open.  Red slide can come off so be careful not too lose it.
Baby,5.0,Highly engaging for a baby,"These cuffs are baby's first &#34;educational&#34; toy. My grandson is three months old, and of course randomly waves his arms. When he happens to wave the lady bug or bumble bee in front of his face, he is delighted! It won't be long before he figures out that he can control those wrists to which these critters are attached. I used a product that was similar 40 years ago with this baby's father, and it does work in that it encourages eye/hand coordination. The grand baby sometimes gnaws on the lady bug so I am thinking I should buy another set. Love the product."
Baby,5.0,My son loves this Dragon,I bought this for my son at birth and he still plays with it at nearly 2 years old! Worth the money!
Baby,1.0,Poor quality,"I suspect this product might not be genuine. The quality of stitching is very poor compared to other Lamaze products I have bought. Also there is nothing else to this product, no sounds, just a lion that's made poorly. Don't buy from this seller."
Baby,4.0,Helpful for sealing Avent bottles,These disks fit into the Avent lids and allow to seal the bottles for storage. They are helpful and work just as advertised. I will mention though that I can't stand how the Avent bottles require that little ring before putting on the lids. I often forget to put on the ring and all lmy precious milk pours out of the bottle. Fortunately the newer Avent models no longer require that silly ring!
Baby,4.0,Interesting Lamaze Product,I have made a habit of ordering Lamaze toys for my daughter. She greatly enjoys this (as an astrological water dragon) but something about it makes it feel of slightly lesser quality than the typical Lamaze. Perhaps developed for another country?
Baby,5.0,A must have,It is so cute. My 2 month old grandson loves it. I have also purchased several more Rain Forest items. Very well pleased
Baby,5.0,Adorable and easy to find.,"My son loves his monkey Wubbanub. Everyone comments about it, but mostly he can easily find it in his crib or diaper bag.  A great purchase."
Baby,5.0,love this... just ordered my second one,"This is a great wipe holder.  I just ordered another one for my Skip Hop Pronto Changer because the little plastic one in there stinks.  I've been using this for about five months now and I honestly haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have written about.  I actually find that it keeps the wipes wet for much longer than cheaper plastic containers.  The red slider has never fallen off.  It isn't super slim, but it is certainly not as big as a wipes container... maybe the tiny \\""travel\\"" size ones, but it's less than half the size of the refill containers I buy.  You do need two hands to open it, but I can't imagine any travel wipes container that you wouldn't have to do that.  It's much easier than other travel containers I've used because you can easily pull out just one wipe, and there's no danger of all the wipes falling out all over the floor of a restroom when you're just trying to get one out, which has happened to me with other containers (hence my purchase of a second one of these!).  I use the strap to attach it to a hook on the inside of my diaper bag so it's easy to find when I need it... I wouldn't hang it on the outside -- no need.  I used this for every diaper change on a 10-day trip to Paris and it was a breeze.  Love it."
Baby,4.0,Cute!!,"I loved it! Very, very cute  I just expected it to be a little bigger then it was. But, perfect size"
Baby,4.0,ok,This is just one of those extra things I thought I needed. Really didn't need or use this as much as I thought I would. Seems well made and is easy to use though. If you like having the extra gadgets then this is for you.
Baby,5.0,fantastic,is the best for you to talk and see your child on your mobile phone. Execellent camera and very good sound.
Baby,1.0,Stopped working after 3 weeks,Cute and fun design with good options for listening and/or rotating the animals. Unfortunately the mechanical design is awful. Similar to the problem other reviewers have experienced the leafs don't allow for the inner ring to rotate. Now it only plays music and lights up. Poorly made. I don't recommend.
Baby,5.0,Must have,"very easy to carry when you are out or in the house, you save alot if you buy big boxes of wipes!!!<br />Very practical , easy to clean easy to open.<br />I definitly recomend it"
Baby,5.0,PERFECT!!,I just wanted to let anyone who owns the Joovy caboose know that this cup holder works PERFECTLY for that stroller.  I absolutely love it and can't think of a thing wrong with it.  And it's sooo much cheaper than the Joovy brand one.  The two cup holders are very adjustable and can fit all different sized beverages.  The device is very sturdy as well.  Have not had any issue with it tipping over.  Even with a three year old jumping to and from the sit/stand seat.
Baby,4.0,cute,"Very cute, i love that this can keep my daughter busy and learning at the same time, while i can do some chores around the house"
Baby,5.0,Storage for everything!,"- Cup holders that are great for mom/dad or kids<br />- zippered pocket was nice to hold keys, wallet, etc.<br />- nice open storage area for toys, pacifiers, snacks, etc.<br /><br />Overall, I am super happy purchasing this item vs. the BOB stroller organizer.<br />This one is much more affordable, durable, and has more storage.<br />Love it!"
Baby,5.0,"Nice music, Baby loves it","My daughter really likes this mobile. The music is all classical (for kids), which isn't as annoying to listen to as some other Fisher Price &#34;songs.&#34; There is also a &#34;rainforest noises&#34; option. The figures are colorful and fun to look at, and the music lasts a long time (not to mention there is a remote in case it stops). Sometimes my baby can watch it for a good 10-15 mins and not get bored. Visually not the prettiest thing, but if you are considering buying this, chances are it's about utility and needing to entertain your baby no matter what. Easily attaches to a regular crib. Easy assembly as well."
Baby,5.0,Son loves it,He's almost 1.5 and still plays with it every day.  Definitely a good find for any budding musician. Love it
Baby,5.0,Favorite Gift,We absolutely love the Wubbanub pacifiers.  We were given one as a gift when our daughter was born and now we give them to everyone we know who has a baby.  They are fantastic and so cute.
Baby,5.0,Love,"So glad that I found this! My Peg Perigo doesn't have anywhere to hold my cup, keys, bottle, etc.  This is a perfect fit and easy to use!"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,There are many different settigns and the baby likes them all can play music animal sounds or both and it is very soothing
Baby,4.0,It's good but not great!,I was interested in purchasing this monitor because my previous monitors were bad. This one is ok but still lacks some features that are important for this type of product. The microphone is weak so you cannot hear well what is happening with your baby and you cannot speak to him because there is no built in speaker. Besides that is ok.
Baby,5.0,The best!,We got one of these for a gift and had to buy more after seeing how well our granddaughter loved them.
Baby,5.0,My Baby Loves It,What else is there to say?  Baby loves this giraffe.  I purchased it because of the contrasting black and white on his belly.  My one month old stares at this thing and loves grabbing the ring and hitting the giraffe's feet.  It seems to be good quality so far and the giraffe is very soft!
Baby,5.0,Great idea!,Excellent for helping baby learn to put his pacifier in his mouth and its a great teething toy.  My son is 6 months and never puts this thing down.
Baby,5.0,nice,"Grandbaby loves looking at them wrapped around anything but his wrists, especially the bee. You can attach them to anything."
Baby,5.0,Very practical,I really liked order this article because it is very practical and I can carry everything from my daughter and additional drinks other things and those who are with her.
Baby,4.0,Good but not great,"I like that this gives me the ability to actually hold things on the City Mini, but at this point I am really disappointed with the City Mini and the need to buy 8 million 3rd party accessories in order to make it useful. The stroller organizer itself is good, in that it gives you 2 cupholders and space for toys/keys/wallet, etc. The velcro that holds it on the stroller handle is hard to get level and stay in place, as it naturally has some movement."
Baby,4.0,Almost perfect,"The tip of the pacifier is completely rounded as opposed to the slightly curved ones that contour to the inside of the baby's mouth better. I suppose it all comes down to the child's preference... in our case the little one isn't a fan of the strictly cylindrical pacifier nipple so he won't keep this in his mouth for long. Still fun though and can serve as a slight distraction.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very cute, lightweight monkey. Almost worth it just for the stuffed animal<br />Sturdy pacifier with no rubbery taste, holds up to biters<br /><br />Cons:<br />The monkey is only attached to one end of the pacifier, which makes me worry that it will rip off if the little one decides to pull too hard. Every time I pick it up I think &#34;I hope this doesn't rip off as easily as it feels like it could...&#34;"
Baby,2.0,I owned this for a month and had to return it. Read below...,"I owned this for a month and while in theory the iphone aspect seems perfect it just wasn't convenient to have to rely on my phone for notifications of my baby crying.  If the phone wasn't configured correctly, or was in do not disturb mode it wouldn't make any noise at all.  Plus I always had to make sure it was on me and turned up so I could hear it.  I quickly decided that I was going to need a dedicated unit that would make noise as soon as the baby did.  I decided on the motorola unit below and couldn't be happier.  My favorite part about it is how sensitive it is to the baby making real noise but at the same time how the speaker will actually turn itself off when there's no or next to no noise in the room.  That way you don't get this constant stream of white noise and hear every single peep, snore, and rollover.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VL2VRY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004VL2VRY&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20"
Baby,3.0,Connection issues,"I like the concept of the ibaby. When it works, it's great. The quality is very nice. But it has some wifi connection issues."
Baby,5.0,these are great,"These are very useful to turn any Avent bottle into a storage container.  Just remove the nipple and pop this in its place to store in the fridge or freezer.  To use pop it out and put the nipple back in.  Very small, easy to use, and effective."
Baby,5.0,Handy but will not keep anything cold for long,"It fits on the stroller and is easier to use than the all fabric versions.<br />I can also hang it on a wheelchair.<br />BUT it is described as insulated and having a pocket but the pocket is mesh and not insulated<br />and an insulated 'bowl' does not hold in cold.<br />It is perfect for keys, cups, snack cups and any other small item you need handy."
Baby,5.0,"So far, so good","I was looking for a stroller organizer bc the used Phil and Ted e stroller I bought didn't come with one.  Looking on their website, I didn't want to spend $25 for something I didn't like either.  I ordered this one and the Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer.  I have a 40oz Klean Kanteen Classic Stainless Steel bottle that I wanted to fit into the caddy.  Because the Diono cup holders are flexible, I was able to fit my bottle in there!  I was happy about that.  It's not that deep though...I'd say it went up about half way up the canteen bottle, but it was tight enough for me not to worry about it falling out.  For the Jolly Jumper, I would've had to use the zippered portion to put that large bottle in there, so I returned that.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  I can't say anything about durability just yet.  I'll be taking this on a 3 day trip to Disneyland at the end of June, so that'll be the test."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,"I bought this for my son before he was even born. Once he was here he loved it. I liked it because in the middle of the night it is much easier to find a pacifier attached to a monkey than one that is all by itself. Now that he is 10 months old he doesn't really suck on the pacifier as much as he likes to cuddle with the monkey. I think this will make it easier to take the pacifier away. One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours. I have put it in the washer and dryer many times and it is still good as new."
Baby,2.0,Good concept but very poor execution,"We purchased the Withings Smart Baby Monitor with very high hopes. I had been looking for a smart-phone app based baby monitor with our daughter on the way this summer. After researching a few other similar monitors, this seemed to have the most features and relatively good reviews so we ordered it. Before diving into the review, I should note that I work with computers for a living. So I'm probably a bit more tech savvy than the average user.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I was very pleased with the look and construction of the unit. Very clean looking unit without many buttons or lights. Seems like it would fit into any nursery without standing out too much. Unit isn't too big, and folds up like a clam shell for easy storage.<br /><br />Setup wasn't too difficult. Found the app on the Android market very easily. Instructions were easy to follow, and I was ready to go after connecting to my phone via Bluetooth and connecting my Wifi network. Everything looked pretty good at this point.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately the good feeling didn't stick around long. After I was up and running, I immediately noticed how poor the video frame rate and video quality were. I realized that this would be a huge issue once we were using it with our daughter because the lag almost made the monitor unusable. Without exaggerating, there was at least a 1-2 second lag between live movement and seeing movement on my phone. Just for reference, the camera, my phone, and my wifi router were all within 10 feet of each other during this trial. There was no difference in lag or quality with using Bluetooth or Wifi. I even tried resetting and re-connecting everything from the beginning, but ended up with the same result.<br /><br />I wanted to review the night-vision and other features, but the lag and quality were so bad that I honestly couldn't give a fair review.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointing with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor. Forthe money, I didn't expect a performance this poor. We ended up with a similar product by Motorola, and it has worked great on every test so far."
Baby,5.0,baby loves it,great item. keeps baby entertained. when she lost the first one had to get a new one would not stop crying if she didnt get it
Baby,5.0,Does the job well,I didn't want to pay the $20 for the drink carrier that is made for my stroller so I bought this. It works great with my Britax B-agile stroller and I can fold the stroller while the organizer is still attached. I like that it has a zipper pocket for my keys and othe valuables. The drink holder supports my 24oz water bottle just fine and I don't worry about it coming detached.
Baby,4.0,Works well,This works very well on my stroller that has a cup holder that always falls off. I have been able to fit all my drinks but I don't usually order any Jumbo drinks mostly bottled water.
Baby,5.0,Too cute!,I love this item! It makes keeping up with it much easier! My son likes something to hold on to also!
Baby,3.0,Works Okay but Slider Lid Occasionally Open Itself,"This Skip Hop Swipe wipes case works okay for me. It will do the job for the meanwhile. I'll say the price matches the product.<br /><br />Pros: it hold a good amount of wipes for a short period of time for outings, easy to use when refilling, has a strap that you can clip onto anything (stroller, daiperbag), dispense one wipe at a time, stays moist<br /><br />Cons: the sliding circular lid occasionally slides itself out of position and is unsecured at times (it pops off)"
Baby,1.0,Poor quality & defective,"Like other reviewers mentioned, I had to return this item. The leaves on the mobile was getting stuck and the motor was making clicking noises right out of the box. Also, I found the music box quite bulky & bottom heavy; made the attachment to the crib not so ideal. Thank goodness for Amazon free returns :)"
Baby,5.0,Great on my Bumbleride Indie Twin,"I'm using this across one side of my Bumbleride Indie Twin, and it fits well. It's a great catch-all, & we like the two slots for drinks and the little zipper part in the middle for keys. It works well for us!"
Baby,5.0,Our son loved his monkey!,"Our son loved his WubbaNub! He just recently gave up the pacifier, but up til now, he looked forward to going to bed each night so he could spend time with his WubbaNub. It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well."
Baby,5.0,Best Baby camera,This is what you call as simple as it get with setup and working consistently. We have been searching for an camera that can be use to see the room where ever we are and now we found it in this camera.
Baby,5.0,Just the right size,"i brought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she<br />loves them , they stay on her wrist and she shakes her<br />hands all around."
Baby,5.0,So cute,I ordered this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It can hang on a car seat or use it in the house. It's easy to grasp and big and colorful.
Baby,5.0,Seems like it will work well...,"I read a lot of reviews about how the natural bottles leak.  But one review gave the tip of using this with the Philip Avent classic bottle screw rings.  We haven't used them yet with the natural bottles as the baby won't be here till July, but I tried one one with a bottle ring on a Philip Avent natural bottle and it honestly felt like it all came together with a snap and was extremely secure.  Don't think we will be getting any leaks!  I will probably test these out by putting some water in the bottle along with using the screw rings and sealing discs to see if it leaks.    Update (February 2016): I'm on baby #2 now and using these again with the classic screw rings and natural bottles. I have never haf one leak the entire time I used it for baby #1 and now baby #2.  Really great product."
Baby,4.0,Great,Great item. I was able to use it anywhere I want to.<br />Watching my kid at home and watching my employs at work.
Baby,3.0,good product,"I think there a little expensive now, seeing how wal-mart jas the same thing for only $6. But there not wabanub. And for a 3 month old, they really dont like them as much as i thought. But as the baby gets older the baby will like it more."
Baby,5.0,LOVE!!,"I have both the [[ASIN:B003LQQGE4 Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue]] and the [[ASIN:B000LXQVA4 Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo]]. We needed two jumpers so I just bought both for variety but if I had to only buy 1 jumper, it would definitely be the Fisher Price. My baby LOVES the Rainforest Jumperoo. He laughs, squeals and jumps like crazy in it. He loves all the spinning thingies, the alligator and the sun.  He loves the elephant, monkey and the parrot in the front.  The parrot is definitely the favorite!  Hasn't figured out how to pop out the tiger yet.  Loves grabbing the blue frog.  He plays with each and every thing as he rotates around.  He is just so happy in this thing.<br /><br />In case you are debating which one of the 2 to get...... The Baby Einstein is definitely not as jumpy and the seat is not as snugly so I have to stuff some blankets in his back. I believe this affects the jumpiness of the jumper, the huge gap in the seat. So the Baby Einstein is basically like an exersaucer but it is better than a [[ASIN:B007IV17PQ Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center]], for instance, because you can switch out the toys. The Baby Einstein has those 2 arches and 6 loops. You can also attach even more toys with those plastic links such as [[ASIN:B008IT76AW Infantino Ring-A-Links Teether Set]]. I have switched out toys so many times as my baby grew. I didn't use the toys that it came with because they are not BPA free. I took off the sun and the cloud because he kept licking it. I didn't use any of the detachable little toys that it came with. I replaced everything with BPA free and organic toys. Obviously I left the piano and spinner but hey, you do what you can. Every little bit helps. So I would definitely recommend both. The Fisher Price as a jumper and the Baby Einstein as an exersaucer. I do put pillows underneath both because we have hardwood floors and I noticed that my baby's pinky toes would bleed when he jumped too hard."
Baby,5.0,Very interesting,My grandson loves the colors and faces on these.  They are perfect for when little ones are just discovering their world.
Baby,2.0,"bad seller, great product, it's adorable!",The product is great but the packaging it came in looked like it was sitting in a warehouse for a really long time. I wouldn't but from this seller again.
Baby,4.0,Good,"This item is well worth its money, small and convenient for its price. The wipes do dry out eventually, but it took over a month for that  to happen. I would recommend this item."
Baby,5.0,Best stroller accessory,"I was initially looking for a standard cup holder for my McClaren XLR and ran across this item. While sceptical at first the price was so affordable I figured I'd give it a try, besides all of the reviews I read were excellent. And the reviews were right!!! Not only is the holder convenient and sturdy but very efficient. It can hold almost anything and not slide or flip over, its so good I've ordered a second one for my Stokke and am telling all my stroller mom friends about it."
Baby,1.0,2 years and 2 monitors later.. not worth it.,"I have changed this review from 3 stars to 1.   I'm 2 years strong in dealing with withings. After year one my original purchase died. They replaced it free of charge because I was one week short of the warranty expiring. That made me happy that they stood behind the product and assured me this isn't typical of their product.   1 year 1 month later the battery inside the unit exploded and the unit itself will no longer turn on. Because I am 1 month past the warranty now they are offering me a 25% discount to buy a new one. They said it's normal for their batteries to swell but not explode. I told them to keep the discount I'll buy another unit from a different brand at full price. I'm not risking a leaky battery on my baby or future babies. Their customer service is much to be desired. I'm done with WITHINGS.     Original review: Ok let me start off by saying that I really liked this monitor at first. I hate buyers remorse and would have talked myself out of most issues.  I have 2 HTC Thunderbolts (Android 4.0.4) with which I side loaded this app onto because it wasn't &#34;compatible&#34;. I also own the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 which I downloaded the app from the Amazon app store being that it was actually compatible.  With the FIRE HD 8.9 on wifi only I was able to use the microphone, check the temp/humidity, be alerted of too much noise or motion, play a lullaby and turn on the night light. I could also control the volume of the lullaby as well and change the song. The issue was that after about 4 hours or so the app would just turn off. If i was around for that event i could easily just click the app and it was back on again. However, in the middle of the night you dont realize the app turned off. Being unsure if this was a problem with the app, hardware of the monitor, or the Kindle Fire, i decided to try side loading the apps onto our smartphones and try with those.  With side loading the app onto our HTC thunderbolts that were supposably incompatible i was able todo everything i was able to do on the FIRE HD. Pleased with that I hoped that I would be able to have this on all night as well. Nope about four hours into it, it to would just turn off. Again not sure if it was the app, the smartphones, or the monitor itself and then possibly my wifi network connection. I decided to view the app remotely and see if i could rule out the network connection. Complete access even remotely was nice but it did seem again that after so many hours it would just randomly turn off.  I contacted customer support with all the information i provided above and asked for their help. They were awesome about trouble shooting and giving me suggestions. Suggestion 1: Turn the smartphone or tablet completely off resetting the ram memory and then try running the app all night. Result: Fail. Suggestion 2: Rule out the hardware issue of the Baby Monitor: Try with an apple product. If the Apple product is able to run all night then its an Android problem. If it fails as well it is either a network problem or the baby monitor itself.   I got ahold of an iTouch 4th generation(running on iOS 6). An iTouch is alot cheaper and easier to get (without contracts and such so I could return it easily as well). I ran the iTouch all night on the wifi network of my house and it worked flawlessly. Never turned off. And even when it had an interruption in the connection, it reconnected itself and didnt just turn the app off like the Androids i own did.  So customer service resolved the issue as far as what was the weak link. However, I was extremely displeased with the fact that they did nothing to help me with an Android problem with which was the issue. So I spent $250 on this monitor and another $180 on an iTouch with which all that money I could have bought a wireless security camera with all the bells and whistles for that money. I would have lost a few baby friendly features but over all the monitoring would have been the same.  Bottom line: If you own an apple product this will work for you flawlessly. If you own android only products like I did, contact people who have the same android model as you and software and see if they had an issue. I can tell you from my experience the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 and the HTC THUNDERBOLTS did NOT work flawlessly. If you insist on buying this product and still have android only products i suggest buying an iTouch if you are not planning on buying an iPad or iPhone anytime soon. The iTouch can do everything an iPhone can do with some limitations (like making a Tower call or using 3g/4g) but for wifi purposes it can do all the same things for the most part at a much cheaper price."
Baby,5.0,Best toy for my young baby,"My baby did not start grabbing toys early. We have been waiting while trying to teach him to reach out to a bunch of colorful toys. None of them had him interest enough to really reach out for. This pink little dragon was given at baby shower and it was the one that my baby like the most. He would stop crying when we shake it in front of him in the car. And guess what, it was the first toy he ever had enough interest to reach out and explore (4 months old). I was really glad. After that for days before he started grabbing on other toys solidly. I will buy another Lamaze soft toy today!"
Baby,5.0,Fascinating Socks!,My grandson is fascinated with his feet with these socks on...he seems to love kicking and watching the colorful bugs! A very sweet and useful gift for a baby.
Baby,5.0,adorable,my nephew loves the thing.  He holds onto it and is able to keep it in his mouth much easier.
Baby,1.0,Buy a different one,"As a new parent I did not really understand what to look for in toys for my baby. I purchased this based on the reviews but have been very disappointing with this product. I would not buy this jumperoo again, in fact, I wish I had bought a different one. As other reviews have stated, it's too tall for a younger baby. Also, the toys are kind of boring and not really very usable. My baby likes the jumping but the toys aren't very engaging. Like others have posted the tiger with the rainbow barely pops up so it's not engaging. The \\""bug\\"" does not stand up as in the picture however, my baby like to chew on it. The spinning lizard with beads is okay but she only plays with that for a min. or so. The music is cute but there's not too much variety and the other \\""toys\\"" on that bar are a disaster. The elephant is facing the wrong way and is extremely hard for even me to turn. The other hanging toys don't really swing very well. The hanging plush toys above are unreachable. What are they even supposed to do? The overall structure seems stable but not as much as I would like. Overall the jumperoo seems cheap for how expensive it is.<br />TL;DR Seems cheap for the money, toys aren't fun, buy a different one!"
Baby,5.0,"6 disks included, works in natural bottles","I was pleasantly surprised that they indeed had come in a 6 pack.  So I was one of the customers that did order too many.  I have twins, so they will get their use.  Also I was pleased to find that these new sealing disks compared to the older models from a couple years ago have a second rim that accommodate the new natural line.  At first when you put the cap on they seem loose, but when you close the bottle the pressure of the bottle against the cap forms a nice solid seal.  Soo glad they fit the natural bottles."
Baby,5.0,Just got this today and already love it!!,"I love this thing; It took only about 15 - 30 minutes to assemble. My 5 month old is too short for it but better too short than too tall! It has 3 different height adjustments and at the lowest he is too short but I put my snoogle pregnancy pillow underneath his feet and there he was jumping away! He seemed to be overwhelmed by all the toys at first but he's been in this for close to an hour and still isn't tired of it. I'm able to clean the kitchen, finish cooking, and write this review. I'd say this is a must buy for first time moms who just need a few extra minutes of free time! Sorry to sound like an infomercial or something but Im really happy with it so far. Now this is my first day with it so I will update if anything changes."
Baby,5.0,It's like an extra set of hands,"I'm really happy I bought this product! I had read good reviews and that's why I also want to leave positive feedback.  My baby simply loved this mobile, loved the music and the movement of the leaves with the animals. It has been my saver many times when putting my baby to sleep.  Highly recommend!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome,Awesome!!! Another great Wubbanub we love!!!! Wubbanubs are the only pacis my son will take. I'm sure we will be buying more!
Baby,5.0,"Got it for umbrella stroller, but used it on my Jogger!","I bought this to give me storage on my umbrella stroller during a vacation to the Grand Canyon (I'll note here that my umbrella stroller is the cheap one,... I hate it, but it was cheap and small / lightweight,)<br />Anyway, it worked fine. It was a pain to have to detach it to take it on the busses. It would have been nice if it had slightly longer straps so I could carry it like a bag. But, it served its purpose for our trip - not at all upset with the purchase!!<br /><br />Then I took the kids to the zoo, using a jogger, and was happy to see that I could attach it, and add storage under the attached cup holders AND under the canopy. Our water bottles were in the shade! (see picture)<br />Since the jogger folds rather than collapses all around, I could easily leave it attached!<br /><br />To be honest, I wouldn't have given this product 5 stars until I used it with my jogger."
Baby,5.0,Fit on out City Mini GT perfectly.,Great price and we use it all the time! Fit great on our stoller and I'm glad we didn't spend the money on the one that Baby Jogger sells.
Baby,2.0,Did not live up to expectations,"Before we purchased the Withing Baby Monitor, we did a ton of research on different consumer sites. It came down to the Withings versus a Foscam IP camera. We ended up deciding on the Withings monitor because it was essentially an IP camera built up to be a baby monitor. There were a lot of great features like the ability to play songs, the night light, and night vision. Plus it was compatible for both Apple and Android products (very important since we have both). If you watch the demo video on the Withings web page, the resolution is great during the day. Night vision also looks very clear. Can't go wrong with this purchase right?<br /><br />The camera arrives, and I go to download the app on my Android. The Google Play store tells me \\""device not compatible\\"". Okay, well let me try my tablet. It has a different version of the Android OS so it should work.. \\""device not compatible\\"". After scouring their website I did find a buried link to an Android app. It works on my tablet, but crashes on my phone. Things are not starting off well.<br /><br />We test out the video. I have the camera on in a decently lit room. My wife is on the couch maybe six feet away from the camera, and I can barely see her. The pinch to zoom works, but all I get is a garbled pixelated mess. There was also close to an 8-10 second lag. This was over Wi-Fi, and I know my network isn't congested. I plugged the camera into my gigabit LAN just to see if it was any better. It was not.<br /><br />I'm still really trying to find a reason to like this product. We turn off all the lights and test the night vision. You cannot see anything. Night vision does not work at all. The only things that did seem to work on the monitor were the lullaby's, and night light. But with a $250 price tag, I really need more out of my device.<br /><br />We returned the device and purchased a Foscam FI8910W IP camera. At less than $90, it does everything I need and more. Of course it does require a little bit more know howin setting up versus the Withings monitor, but it really is well worth it. Lag time is virtually unnoticeable. The clarity of the video is excellent. There are apps available for both Android and Apple. And the night vision is amazing. I can zoom in on a picture on my wall while it's pitch black and make out the lettering.<br /><br />In summary, I hope this helps someone out in the future. I went into this really hoping for an amazing product, and just could not be more let down. I saved a ton of money with another product, and it works."
Baby,5.0,Wish I'd found these sooner,"Bought these with the avent standard breast pump conversion kit so I was able to pump directly into my bottles and not have more pump bottles to clean every day.  I think I'd be pumping for 6 months before I found these, and I wished I'd found them sooner!  These are also just great for portability to make sure your bottles don't spill.  Highly recommend getting these if you use Avent bottles."
Baby,5.0,Brings the FUN!,Our 4 month old granddaughter absolutely LOVES this jumperoo! A lot of options for amusement and she has loved being in it for over an hour each time....then eats and naps...and if I ask her if she wants to &#34;do Happy Feet&#34;---she flashes a huge grin and wants to get back in there to dance to the music!<br />She will outgrow this in a small amount of time---but it is worth every penny for the joy it brings!
Baby,4.0,Better than the rest,"I'm only on day 3 of this monitor, but it's working so already it's better than the other ones I've tried.<br /><br />There's about a 2-second delay. (Just like similar monitors.)<br /><br />This was the first monitor we looked into, but it had a $13 price tag on the app (that we'd both need) so I refused to buy it on principle. Now the app is free.<br /><br />We bought the Baby Ping (which we couldn't get to connect to our internet) and the Phillips (which we hooked up, but once we moved it, couldn't get it to re-find the crib).<br /><br />I'm sure this monitor will have some negatives as I use it more, but it was easy to install, so far has been reliable, is easily relocated (I like to monitor the dogs when we're out), can go wireless, clips to crib without having to be screwed into the wall (ping) or propped on something (phillips).<br /><br />Bottom line is I think this is a 3-star product, but gets 4 based on it's place in the current market of this type. I'd think that someone would have come up with a better one already, but when I watch the news, there is a delay so I guess I can't expect much more.<br /><br />BTW I saw one review complaining that you shouldn't have to have an iPhone to use this monitor. I'm not sure why you would buy this if you don't have an iPhone, but I'm only comparing it to monitors that are for iPhone use and are viewable from anywhere. I'm not interested in just seeing the baby when I'm home, I want it for pet monitoring when I'm out."
Baby,1.0,Product worked for one day,"I have ordered a replacement one so hopefully the new unit will work properly.  The one day it worked, it had decent video quality, had a nice night light the could rotate colors, but the microphone option to talk through the unit just locked up the app everytime you tried to use it.  Hoping the new unit will actually so I can update my review!"
Baby,5.0,So original!,"this product is so original! my baby tried so many pacifiers before, but this definitely is his favorite! Love it!"
Baby,5.0,awesome,love the case. lost one bought another. lost it again bought a new one:) hope i won't loose it again!
Baby,4.0,Great for baby and parents.,These are great! No more searching for pacifiers FOREVER and baby can get it in their mouth much earlier on. They also like the cuddle of the monkey.<br /><br />I don't like that it doesn't disconnect so I know we ended up washing it a lot less than we would have but we have a perfectly healthy 1 year old now so didn't seem to bother him. Monkey eventually does fall off. We have gone through 3 of these in the 1st year of his life but it is worth it!
Baby,5.0,Does what it should!,"These discs are great for using Avent bottles to store breastmilk (which I loved) but also great for sealing off bottles while on the go (Breast milk, water, formula, juice any liquid)"
Baby,4.0,Baby LOVES this,"My baby would not take a pacifier (from birth to now, 6 months) yet had a very strong suck/chew desire.  A friend (pediatrician) gave us one of these as a shower gift.  My son LOVES it.  He chews/sucks on it from all angles and it sooths him like nothing else. The pacifier is very well attached, I inspect it daily and it is not loosening or wearing at all.  We ordered this second one so we would have a spare.<br />Highly recommend! Buy it! It’s the best 15 bucks we have spent."
Baby,5.0,Great accessory!,"This organizer is super easy to attach to any of our strollers (ones with two separate handles and ones with a single bar-type handle) and fits and works well on all of them. I use it for every walk and outing we go on with a stroller, because it's so nice to be able to keep my phone, water bottle, etc. handy. I love this thing and kind of want to buy another one, so I don't have to keep moving it between my strollers all the time. The only downside I can think of is that when I fold up my Inglesina Zippy stroller (folds up like an umbrella stroller), this thing can't really fold up with it, so I have to unloop at least one side of it. But honestly, it's not a big deal at all. Again, I love this thing so much. Highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,Cute,"My daughter loves all her wubbanubs. I bought 4, 'cause she doesn't accept any other pacifier. This one I bought as a gift. It's so cute and soft!"
Baby,5.0,Good,"Bought this for my son when he was born. The animal was a little small so it didnt quite keep the pacifier in place, but for the price it was great!"
Baby,2.0,Needs to be attached to crib to see anything,"This camera really needs to be attached to the crib to have any decent resolution.  I tried putting it on the dresser that's just a foot away from the end of the crib (propped up on some blocks).  The resolution - both daytime and night time - was horrible.  It really needs to be attached to the crib using the included mounting bracket.  It's pretty much a glorified binder clip.  Any baby who can pull to standing will rip this thing off.  My son is almost 3, so I've had to carefully explain to him that he needs to be careful and not touch the camera because it is very expensive and easy to break.  I would be really nervous to use it around a younger baby or toddler as it's really easy to yank off.  I guess you could mount a shelf and then put the camera on the shelf.  However, one big drawback is that it needs to be opened to 90 degrees or the resolution is even poorer (I learned this on the Withings FAQ website).  It's very tricky to pull that off without using the angled bracket that attaches to the crib (that is easy to yank off).  I'm seriously considering returning it for these reasons."
Baby,5.0,Best Monitor Ever,"This is my 3rd monitor. I loved my 1st, which was just a normal Summer Infant. 2nd was the $300 Summer Infant, and had no tilt so you couldn't move it with your baby, but I loved the app where you can view your baby from anywhere. So when I came across iBaby, I went for it. The reviews are bad, and I'm not really sure why. I love love love this product. The app is flawless, the hardware is amazing, the picture is beyond anything I ever expected..... I can't believe people didn't like this product. If you love Apple Products, you will love this purchase.<br /><br />Sending my Summer Infant back today. :) Def going to recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
Baby,5.0,great value and functionality with babyjogger city double,"Was perfect for our Baby jogger City series double stroller. Fit on one half of the sides, and doesn't get in the way when you need to collapse the stroller.  For the price, it's all you need - save your money (babyjogger version is 3x the price) and buy this one."
Baby,5.0,A must have for newborns,I ordered this product thinking it was really cute and my baby would be able to use it when he was a little older and capable of grasping objects. After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.
Baby,3.0,Good but...,"My daughter enjoys the jumperoo, and it was working great but the part that lights up and makes noise stopped working after approx 6 months of occasional use.. I've changed the batteries but it's just broken. She loves to jump but I can see she quickly tires of the toys.. if I had to buy another jumperoo I'd get one with more toys on it."
Baby,5.0,The Perfect Mobile,"My granddaughter loves this mobile, The night light, the remote, the music and sounds of the rainforest.  We all love that she loves it so much"
Baby,5.0,Love this item!,"got this for my 6 month old daughter because she was having trouble with a traditional pacifier.  Once she dropped it in her crib, she couldnt get it back in her mouth again.  She is able to hold on to the monkey and easily finds her way back.  easy to wash clean.  I wish they used Nuk pacifiers, but this works fine. Ordering her another one!"
Baby,4.0,Love it,It is exactly what I was looking for.  It was the perfect gift for  the baby shower it was purchased for.
Baby,4.0,Baby enjoys!,My 8 month old loves her teether keys! She enjoys the sounds it makes and that she can chew all over it!
Baby,5.0,Works great,We already have our second child using this mobile. Both of them loved it. We love the remote - our 7 month old sleeps in our bedroom. All we have to do is use the remote to turn it on in the middle of the night. Amazing product!
Baby,4.0,"I was skeptical, but this works well","I wasn't sure about this case, but decided to try it since our diaper bag didn't come with a wipes case and I didn't want to buy travel size wipes just for the diaper bag.  It's a little bigger than I would like, but it does work well.  The slide top is easy to use and huggies wipes work perfectly in this container.  This is a great travel case especially for the price."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for Britax B-Agile Stroller,"Those with a Britax B-Agile stroller will know there isn't a parent tray included.  I bought this to old keys, water, etc.  I am glad I did.  It fits perfectly on the handles and is very useful.  I can easily access my water, phone, and any thing else I need right away.  This definitely makes my B-Agile even more versatile than it already is."
Baby,5.0,great organizer,"I bought this for a trip to Disney.  It held drinks, my camera, etc. It attached perfectly to my city micro and did not get in the way of folding it."
Baby,4.0,great for city mini,"I bought this organiser recently and so far so good. The only thing is - it had strong smell, so I had to leave it to air for a couple of days."
Baby,5.0,Perfect addition to our nursery,"We purchased the ibabyhot after reading many mixed reviews. Some negative some positive. With this camera I also purchased a wifi extender to put into the nursery. I was a little nervous to plug it in after reading the nightmare setup reviews, but went ahead with it anyway. I read the simple instructions and did just as they instructed. Setup on<br />Y took 3 mins tops. It works perfect. Now I can check in on my little girl from anywhere. I have mine running off the extender on wifi not the cord and they is very little delay. This thing has been a live saver and the added bonus is I can check in on her even at work.  Night vision with this camera is also amazing"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my City Mini,"I attached to my City Mini as soon as it arrived & haven't removed it since! I can open & close it without it getting in the way and it holds my refillable water cup, my daughter's Avent bottle and anything else I can pack in it like my phone, keys and my 7yr old's small Sunny Delight bottle."
Baby,4.0,Good once installed,"It worked fine in the house, however, it took an Internet technician to get the networking to work outside the home. It is now working wonderfully. My son can actually view the nursery from Afghanistan, so for that we are so pleased."
Baby,5.0,"Bright, colorful, fun textures and noises",My 5 month old daughter loves this dragon.  She loves the textues and the crinkel noises the wings make. The tail is really easy for her to grab.
Baby,5.0,Great for a day,Purchased last night and had my grandson for the day.  He is four months and it was a great toy for him to play with for a while.  He really liked the cat and bird it was great to watch him try to reach for them.  I don't think it would be the best toy for him everyday because I believe he may get bored.  A great toy to have at grandparents house because it is small and don't take up a lot of room.
Baby,3.0,love it but.....,"LOVE this device ... but I'm arguably a 'techie' who doesn't mind rebooting things, and fiddling with settings occasionally on my devices and even I get annoyed at constantly having to 'reboot' the app on my iphone or iPad to connect - I also think the device 'hogs' IP addresses of other devices on the network somehow occasionally and requires rebooting the wifi and router ... when it works, it's definitely a 5 star device ... when it doesn't, your annoyance factor rises quickly to 10+<br /><br />I travel a lot and LOVE being able to check in on my little guy over 3g ... it's still worth the money despite the constant crashing / buggy app .... in my opinion"
Baby,5.0,Perfectly fun for babies!,"We just bought this a few weeks ago for my 3 month old.  She can't reach the floor yet even on the lowest setting, but we just put a pillow underneath and she can bounce away.  She loves the blinking lights and sounds and the fact that the seat swivels and full 360 degrees around.  I like that the back of the seat comes up high to protect her head if she gets a little too bouncy in there.  It is a little bulky, but that's because it has so many toys to play with all the way around.  It is sturdy and well made and keeps her entertained for a long time. It was very easy to put together, took about 10 min. including taking it out of the packaging.  I was looking at another jumper, but kept reading reviews that said they wished they had gone with the Rainforest Jumperoo or that they eventually ended up with this one anyways so I decided to purchase this one from the start and definitely do not regret it."
Baby,3.0,It's okay,I like it but dust and small particles tend to stick to the knight part of the toy. Wouldn't but again.
Baby,5.0,love it,Bought this for young man with Autism. They are great for keeping him occupied while transporting to and from school
Baby,4.0,Holds the Necessities,Works as specified - holds plenty of wipes for the diaper bag.  My only negative is that the red sliding &#34;dispenser&#34; opening can be a little sticky to open.  It does fit fine in our diaper bags for carrying.
Baby,5.0,Love it,Very good product for hi-tech parents :) Recommended for everyone who want to check on baby any time. Love it.
Baby,5.0,very good,"very good toy, my baby liked it very much i will buy more toys from lamaze :) it wood be better if the company will ship it faster for free, just too much time to wait..."
Baby,5.0,Works great on the Joovy Caboose,"We bought this for our Joovy stroller and it has worked great so far!  I really like the adjustable velcro straps because you can change how high or low the organizer sits on the handlebars.  We have found they are quite sturdy as well, supporting two 32 oz water bottles.  The material feels very durable and strong.  Great purchase, especially for the Joovy Caboose."
Baby,5.0,A Baby Favorite!,Greatest invention of the century!  It's so adorable how infants hold on to this pacifier.  Most children love monkeys and this combination makes it a win-win gift.
Baby,4.0,Dragon for my Dragon Baby,"My daughter was born in The Year of the Dragon, inspiring a dragon theme in her nursery. Because there is not a lot of baby dragon items out there, I purchased this dragon toy to go with the &#34;theme.&#34; At 9 months, she still plays with this toy, as I have it attached to her car seat."
Baby,5.0,Great,Great product from avent. I now use my old small avent bottles as containers of small stuff like hairclips etc.
Baby,4.0,Does its job,"I use it on my City Mico, it does its job. You don't have to take it off to fold the stroller. I've had two iced coffee in the organizer and they didn't spill. Even when the stroller seat is reclined all the way down, the organizer stays in place."
Baby,5.0,Great!,Easy to find in carseat while driving! And easy for them to find in crib in the middle of the night!
Baby,5.0,so easy to use.,Looks great easy to use great size perfect for carry on.<br />Love that is clear so you can see when to refill.
Baby,5.0,Great mobile.,"I wanted a mobile I didn't have to wind up as majority do now, this one has a switch and a remote which hangs on bubs door handle for easy access if he is unsettled. When I first looked at the pics I thought it looked flimsy however that is not the case at all. Bub and I and my 5 year old all love it."
Baby,3.0,It works,This was much bigger than I thought it was going to be.  But it works good and didn't go through batteries too fast.  Worth the $$.
Baby,1.0,terrible!,"Its terrible! Red lid comes off very easily. If you put more wipes it opens by it self! i hate it , very bulky. Do not buy it."
Baby,3.0,Okay product,"Maybe it's just my twins but these didn't seem to help them \\""find their feet\\"". I used only a few times. Wasted the money but maybe it works for others??!"
Baby,5.0,monkey adorable,My grandson lost his &#34;monkey&#34; and we needed to get one fast as the stores were sold out.  He loves &#34;monkey&#34; because he can hold onto it while he uses the pacifier. Great idea.
Baby,3.0,physical therapist recommended,My son's PT recommended we get these feet rattles and i thought the colors would be good but the rattle isn't very loud so didn't keep my son interested
Baby,3.0,Torticollis,My son's PT recommended we get these feet rattles and i thought the colors would be good but the rattle isn't very loud so didn't keep my son interested
Baby,5.0,Good to me,"Put on my gababoo bee .i can leave my phone my keys and my sons toys in there,really Strong and useful for me !"
Baby,5.0,Cool Toy,Think this is an awesome toy for a newone in your life.  I purchased for my new great nephew who's nursery is all jungle animals so the giraffe will fit in perfectly.  Hope he has lot's of fun playing with it
Baby,5.0,Love,My daughter loves her Buddy as she calls it! We never leave home without him! It his is actually one I bought as a gift for a friend! She had seen my daughter's and asked about it for her newborn. I highly recommend these! They're cute and pretty easy to keep up with! My daughter likes to rub hers as she falls asleep.
Baby,5.0,Super!,Would recommend to anyone!  Keeps the pacifier from instantly landing on the floor and bouncing around when baby lets go.  My baby is also able to get it back in her mouth sometimes on own!  Great product!  Only complaint is that it's harder to clean (obviously) than usual pacifier.
Baby,5.0,Best $10 I ever spent!,"I love this thing.  It is so convenient.  There is plenty of space in the middle pocket (I often surprise myself how much junk I can fit in there - toys, socks, pacifiers etc.), there are also two cupholders which enable you to take a bottle of water for yourself and one for the baby.  It has a nifty little zipper mesh pocket where you can put your cell phone or other items that can fall out, and the velcro is super strong and durable.  I couldn't be happier with this organizer, fits perfectly on my Britax B-Agile."
Baby,5.0,Best.toy.ever!,We just received this for our 4 month old son about a week ago (who is extremely needy and thinks he has to be held or in his ergo 24/7.) He's 26 1/2 inches long and he can JUST reach with his toes (I know a lot of people complain about it not having a min height) the seat turns effortlessly for him (he always gravitates to the musical toy.) The best part of this toy... I can make dinner without baby!!
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,This is a good toy to use for tommy time with any infant. My son enjoyed laying on the little pillow and playing with the giraffe and palm tree.He also loved kicking the ball on the bottom up the mat. We used this mat until he grew out of it.
Baby,5.0,Excellent jumper,So glad that I read lots of reviews and did some research before buying a jumper for my daughter. She is 4 1/2 months old and loves this jumper! Lots of hands on activities and she loves it that when she jumps the sounds are activated. I would highly recommend this jumper.
Baby,5.0,Good for newborns,The gentle rattling makes this a wonderful cause and effect toy for newborns. They can go on wrists or ankles to encourage movement to create the sound!
Baby,4.0,Sons Love It,"I have a 4 year old and he loves the remote that he can use to help turn this on for his baby brother. His brother finds the animals moving to be magic. Easy to set up, doesn't seem to be sucking the life out of the batteries as fast as some of the toys I had for his brother when he was a babe. Super cute in person. =)"
Baby,4.0,"Baby Girl loves it, but took some growing into (& then quickly grew out of it)","We received this when baby girl was around 4 months old, at that point she couldn't reach the floor and was only somewhat entertained by the whole thing. When I got it I actually thought it was defective because, as others have mentioned, the elephant seems to be facing the wrong way and is *very* difficult even for me to turn. I also thought the bug/butterfly was broken because it just flops around but I guess that's what they intended.<br /><br />Baby girl eventually got tall enough to reach the floor on the 1 setting and started to get the hang of it, then really loved the bouncing. She initially went for the spinning parts of the toys b/c she was familiar with that activity from some other toys she has. Then she went for the floppy bug, which is apparently great for chewing on. It also took her a while to realize she could turn the seat, but now she's got that covered too.<br /><br />She only recently at 7 months started messing with the peek-a-boo tiger, but she just pulls on the tiger, she doesn't push the button. Although, as others comment, that button is pretty worthless for getting the tiger to really pop out.<br /><br />But it's the bouncing that she really enjoys and that's the part that's developing her muscles so I'm good with that. The only problem is that now she's at a height where she's between level 1 and 2. I wish there was a level 1.5. If I had a way to sew in another level on the straps I would b/c now on level 1 her knees are bent. She still bounces but I worry that she's really landing hard, but I guess now she's really working her legs b/c she's practically doing burpees with the squat/jumps she's doing. I tried switching to level 2 but she can barely touch her toes then. It's surprising what a difference the two levels are.  I'll try changing levels again in a couple weeks.<br /><br />I like that there are at least the two sound levels, the music gets annoying *really* fast. So I also like the setting that doesn't make constant noise - if she's not bouncing a lot the sounds don't come on as much.<br /><br />This thing is a pretty good space hog. It takes up a LOT of room in a small NYC apartment but I managed to rearrange some things so we can leave it up instead of trying to \\""fold\\"" it away. Even in the folded position it takes up a lot of room, but it at least helps a little if you do need to store it away, I just got tired of dealing with opening and closing it. The one complaint I had about having to open and fold it was that the little button you push to release the sections is pretty hard to push in. Maybe it's the angle I was working at but it was a pain (sometimes also literally) to release the sections so I could lap them.<br /><br />But for the couple issues with the toys and the significant height differences in the levels I would give this a 5. If baby girl only sort of liked it I would give it 3 stars, but she *loves* this thing - she's at the age where she is dying to move around on her own and this seems to give her some feeling of being able to move (until she gets cranky then she seems to feel trapped...). I only wish she could sit in it for longer than she does so I could get more done.<br /><br />(Update: now at almost 9 months she's not quite as interested in this, in fact, she cries when we try to put her in it. She's moved on to crawling all over so she's not fond of anything that confines her. So, like so many baby items, this was great for a short period of time.)"
Baby,5.0,My Baby loves it!,"I don't know why, but she loves it!  She likes the animals.  She likes the music.  She has liked it since birth and is 8 months old now and still loves to look at it.  In fact, it is part of her bedtime routine. I bought it used for $10, but after seeing how much she loves it, I think that it is actually worth $50."
Baby,5.0,Works good on Uppababy Vista,"I bought it to save money from the expensive accessories the Uppababy requires and it does the job!<br />I wouldn't put a hot beverage in it, but for everything else, it's a good fit! And it has a little and convenient pocket with zipper inside.<br />Good product!"
Baby,4.0,Serves it's purpose,Not sure why I bought them but if you need sealing discs these work fine with the Avent bottles.  I think I used it once to shake formula but it was a pain to then switch the nipple so I didn't use it again.  Waste of money.  I'm a first time mom that bought everything and anything.
Baby,5.0,Its Nice,My daughter just loves this toy! Their are all types colors and textures to explore. She loves chewing on the teether and the rings and squeezing the crinkly &#34;foot&#34; of the giraffe. The entire bottom of the giraffe crinkles too which was a nice surprise. Overall a great product for this age to keep them entertained and happy!
Baby,3.0,Better than most,"Overall this is a good product and it's better than any other plug-and-play video monitor currently in the baby market(\\""baby market\\"" being the operative words).<br /><br />Having owned the monitor for over a year I am in a unique position to give a well rounded review.  I have found most owners are overly eager to review prior to experiencing some of the more notorious and well documented issues.<br /><br />This product seems really great at first but inevitably starts to show it's true colors.  If you expect this to stream audio all throughout the night, without interruption your're in for a disappointment.  Nine out of Ten times the connection is interrupted and your audio turns off leaving you unaware until your child starts crying loud enough to wake you.<br /><br />If and when you do have issues good luck getting them resolved in a timely manner.  Customer service is pretty terrible.  I believe this company is headquartered somewhere in France and the only way to communicate with them is via email.  That said, it takes an average of 5 days for them to respond and if they address your concern the first time around consider yourself lucky.<br /><br />As far a video baby monitor is concerned, it's great when it works and it works 85% of the time.  When it doesn't work it is extremely frustrating there is no timely fix.  This could mean you're without a monitor for days or even weeks which only amplifies the frustration.  It seems as though Withings was a little too ambitious with this product and released it prior to properly dev testing and resolving every last bug.<br /><br />Overall, if I had a choice to purchase again I would probably go in a different direction.  It is important to realize there are other comparably priced wireless networking cameras which are not specifically marketed to the baby demographic.  Said wireless network cameras primary function is to stream audio/video reliably and as a bonus, can also be repurposed when the children are older.  They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile.They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile."
Baby,1.0,Terrible Product,"This product simply works terribly.  The customer support is far worse.  I dare you to try to get customer support on the phone...you can't there is a company policy to not take phone calls (not kidding).  That seems ok if they had a well run on-line support center...nope.  We waited three weeks for a response.  The product itself works spotty at best, ours flashes the image and frequently shuts down without warning.  This monitor is responsible for waking myself, my wife or the baby up almost every night- not a feature mentioned in the description.  Save yourself the headache buy ANY OTHER baby monitor.  Thanks for reading this, I feel better getting this off my chest."
Baby,3.0,Good but scary!!,"I don't know if it was completely worth the money but its definitely better than most of the monitors out there. However, I got it for my son who is 2 and around the camera are red lights for the infrared so you can see in the dark. And he was is so scared of it we hardly use it.."
Baby,5.0,Best Pacifier,"I have retired all of our non-Wubbanub pacifiers since my son prefers these so much! They can get a little grungy from being chewed and drooled on, but I just send them through the washing machine. They are very good quality and look brand new when they come out."
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller Accessory,"This stroller organiser is fantastic for my City Mini. There are 2 cup holders on each end with a good sized middle area between to hold snacks, keys, phone, wallet, etc.<br /><br />The organiser attaches to the handlebar via velco so you can adjust it to your needs. The depth of the organiser is sufficient so you don't need too worry about things falling out.<br /><br />There is a smell when you first take it out of the packaging but because it will stay strapped to the stroller in your apt/home/any ventilated area, the smell will quickly dissapate.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. And given the many many positive reviews, so do many other parents (as this seems to acccomodate various stroller brands and models)"
Baby,5.0,Works well,Did exactly what it's supposed to do. Have me a place for 2 drinks and keys. Doesn't work really great for 32 oz and bigger fountain drinks but I would buy again
Baby,4.0,Good console,It's a good console. Fits the city mini stroller by baby jogger nicely. Good price too. What else can I say?
Baby,5.0,Really keeps my little one's interest.,"I  (and returned) 3 other mobiles before I found this one. My LO really engages with this one. The music is great, audible, and lasts for 20 mins before you have to restart. I live that you can restart by just pushing a simple button on the mobile itself or using the remote. The best part about this mobile is that each of the animals turns 360 degrees on its own in addition to the spinning of the mobile.<br /><br />Warning, this is not a mobile to put your LO to sleep though!<br /><br />I just wish manufacturers would make mobiles to fit on playpens."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,Perfect. One word and done. Hold two cups..no problems. Lots of extra room for keys/phone/snacks. Sturdy. Well-made. Matches well with my black Britax B-agile stroller that doesn't come with cup holders. Love it.
Baby,5.0,Won't live without it,"She loves it. The monkey helps to not lose the paci, she loves her little monkey friend. Would buy for someone else."
Baby,5.0,Best thing I've bought,My little one has a blast in it. I wish I would of got it 2 months ago. She belly laughs in it all the time. Must have!
Baby,5.0,Best for babies not yet crawling,"We first got this jumperoo two years ago for my daughters first Christmas.  She was 7 months old at the time.  She enjoyed the seat and used it occasionally but it was never really her favorite.  She was just beginning to crawl and was more interested in moving around on the floor.<br /><br />Now with my second daughter we were able to get this seat out for her when she was first big enough to fit into it, which was around 3 months old.  She has absolutely loved it from the first time we put her in it.  Sometimes she'll jump as hard as she can, while others she'll just pull at some of the toys while resting in the seat.  It is the first thing I'll put her in when I have to get something done.<br /><br />I've decided I think the big difference between my two girls is the ages in which they started using the product.  My first daughter was old enough that jumping wasn't as exciting for her anymore.  She had other ways of moving around and it just didn't keep her attention enough.  Therefore I think this is probably best up until your baby really starts to crawl around and be more mobile.  My daughter is 6 months old now and not quite crawling yet so she is still really enjoying it.  It is a product that has a fairly limited time span for a child, but I think it is worth it for how much fun they have with it.<br /><br />The product has held up really well after being taken apart and put back together between children.  The quality is great and it still looks like new.  I'm sure I will be able to use it again if I have more children in the future, which helps to make it worth the somewhat steep price."
Baby,5.0,Functions as described. Works well with wifi and 4G mobile data service.,"We like it. We connected all of our mobile devices and tablets to this device.  It's easy to set-up, password protected, and provides traditional features of a baby monitor even if you're not watching the video.  For example, if your baby makes noise in the night, your mobile phone or tablet will resonate this sound for you even if the display is turned-off.  The monitor has infrared or low-light video capability that works fine.  You can also talk to your baby, if you connect your own speakers.  The field of view is also adjustable by remote with the slide of your finger.  Works good from my office's wifi network, and from the 4G service from the sidewalk.  I've only connected Apple products to the device, not my computer nor any Android-based device; I'm not sure whether you can do that with this device. For an Apple-product-only device, it's awesome.<br /><br />My overall satisfaction is high as I've purchased other similar products and returned them.  Forcing myself to think of the negatives, it would be nice to have a built-in speaker for the talk-back feature, but this isn't a deal breaker for us.  Also, if you have a limited data plan on your mobile phone, your mobile phone may encounter additional data charges if you're not connected to your wifi network.<br /><br />I recommend this product.<br /><br />As an update, I found the settings to allow me to access this device by Android apps and by my desktop browser."
Baby,5.0,My baby love this jumper!,"My baby absolutely love this jumper!! One of the best purchases we made so far. I just wish it has a mobile toy, that would make this jumper more interesting for my baby! But overall this is a great buy for parents who wants to have a few minutes of free time while baby plays."
Baby,3.0,Perfect for our BOB but they've doubled the price,"We've had our Sunshine Kids stroller buggy buddy on our BOB for two years now and it's exactly what we needed - inexpensive but functional. The two cup holders are great for my son's sippy cups as well as my drinks and I don't feel bad if my coffee sloshes around. Wipes right up and is good as new.  When I fold the BOB up, the console sometimes gets squished but it pops right out again when I unfold the stroller.<br /><br />In fact, I just signed into Amazon to buy two more of these consoles for our new Bumbleride Indie Twin but unfortunately have discovered that this item is TWICE as expensive as it was when I bought it two years ago. Really?? That's why I took off two stars. I really like this console but not for this price. I'm going to keep shopping around."
Baby,5.0,Best!,"I was tired of playing the &#34;find the pack&#34; game all the time. Since we bought this we haven't lost it yet, even though we do have a backup just in case. Not to mention that it's adorable!"
Baby,4.0,The kiddo is obsessed with the Jumperoo,"If my baby were the one writing this review, he would give it 10 stars if he could! He LOVES it. No other toy or activity makes him as giddy as he is when he's in the Jumperoo. He's been using it since he was about 3.5 months, and appears to constantly discover new things about it. He will happily jump around or just sit and play with the toys sometimes up to 45 minutes. It's amazing.<br /><br />I love it too. My only complaint is that I wish there were more options for adjusting the height. We use a padded tray underneath his feet right now, and it seems to work."
Baby,5.0,Very handy,"Brought this for my sit- n-stand stroller that didn't have a cup holder.  It fits well on the stroller and I have packed it full of drinks, toys, sunglasses, etc.  also, it is a good size so my other kids can still sit or stand in the back of the stroller."
Baby,3.0,My 2nd wubbanub.,I always give 5 stars for wubbanubs bc my daughter loves them so much. SHe lights up every time she see them. They are perfect for babies who can't hold their binki in their mouth very well (much like my daughter.) They have flaws such as the cleaning hassle and the brand is in the works of making some for older babies (these are only meant for 0-6). Which sucks bc my daughter is 6m. At least they are trying. But what made me give this 3 stars is not bc of these reasons. i would still give it a 5. The pros totally out wight the cons. but why this particular one earned 3 stars is bc when received it had cotton sticking out of the stitches. It had a huge knot of thread where it was sew shut. The tail had no filling. JUst a long piece of cloth. THe whole monkey felt less filled then her kitty that she has. Other then that its works great. I was just upset about the quality. Shipping back would take wayyyyy to long as i am stationed overseas. It takes forever to send and receive mail out here so i just dealt with it. My daughter can care less about the threading. She loves her wubbanubs.
Baby,5.0,Awesome!!,Very happy with this caddy! Fits my bj city mini perfectly and is big enough to hold my needs. It also has drink compartment to keep drinks cold for my little one and I. It even folds down with the pram so i dont need to take it off each time. Exactly like the sunshine kids one but cheaper. Glad I went with this over the baby jogger one :)
Baby,5.0,Takes Abuse!,Ordered this for my 7-month old son. This jumper takes a lot of abuse from him. He jumps like a madman but the jumper still hasn't fallen apart--been a couple of weeks. Only downside is that his thunder thighs are a little bit of a tight fit.
Baby,4.0,gets the job done,Don't waste your money on expensive cup holders for your BOB stroller. This gets the job done at a fraction of the price.
Baby,4.0,"Great, but baby thinks it's a toy","My 3 month DD old did not want to stay asleep at night, nor did she want to sleep in her crib during the day, so I thought it would be  a good idea to get a mobile. After spending hours of searching amazon and finding very many mobiles that don't do anything, don't last long enough or are defective, I decided on this one because we also have the other rainforest items (bouncy and play gym). It arrived in great shape, we put it together without a problem, and it works just fine. The only thing we ran into was that the remote didn't work, but since DD's crib is in our bedroom anyways, it wasn't a problem for us. The best part about this mobile is that it lasts 20 minutes. We've had it for 3 months now and it is still in great shape. I know a lot of reviews said that the leaves stopped working, but I have not run into that problem.The only real problem-and this may be because the other rainforest items that we have are play related- is that it doesn't put her to sleep. I was afraid of that when I bought this mobile, but I was pretty desperate, so I gave it a shot anyways. Once I turn it on, DD becomes wide awake and starts kicking her legs... she'll do many things except go back to sleep! So, needless to say it has become nothing more than a crib accessory: Something that is not, under any circumstances turned on, but nice for her to look at when she wakes up :). So, if you have the rainforest toys, like the bouncy chair and the play gym, it might keep baby awake if your baby is anything like mine."
Baby,4.0,Great jumper,"My seven month old absolutely loves this jumper. It allows her a great range of motion than other jumpers and the toys are interactive. This jumper was fairly easy to put together (my husband was able to assemble it in 20 minutes). I would recommend this jumper to others. I took a star off because it is overpriced on Amazon, and is cheaper at Wally World"
Baby,5.0,Great Product,My daughter is a bit young and small to fully enjoy but this Jumperoo has so many different pieces for her to play with that I'm sure it will be a favorite in the coming weeks.
Baby,5.0,EXCELLENT!,"This monitor is excellent!  Very clear viewing.  Can watch with my iPhone or iPad.  You can remotely change the music and it has a circle that changes colors or stays one color, you set it. Small and very easy to carry anywhere!  Attaches to the side of a crib or sits on a table.  Night vision is really clear.  I can't say enough about this product!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy!,Ordered this for my nephew when he was about 6 months. He's almost a year now and still loves it. It's a great travel toy and his mom usually keeps it in the diaper bag when he's not playing with it around the house. Recommended!
Baby,5.0,Soooooo happy we purchased this monitor!,"It is so easy to set up, use, and so convenient! You can check on your little one from your phone, iPad at any point in time! The camera can move from side to side so if your little one gets out of bed you can easily follow them. It has a motion detector too if you don't mind an alarm going off when the babe moves. I am so happy we bought this!"
Baby,5.0,Colorful and interesting,Our grandson loved sir prance a lot.  This caught his interest and he started playing with it when he was just starting to reach for things.  Cute toy.
Baby,5.0,perfect for stroller with no mommy storage!,"this fits on my peg perego book stroller perfectly.  it is perfect for holding two drinks, plus keys, cell phones and whatever else in the middle.  it does not feel flimsy.  i love it, and the price is right!"
Baby,5.0,Love It!,My grand-daughter is able to move and jump much more freely than in another one she has access to and uses at another home and will be happy in the rain-forest for long period of time (1 hr). I would recommend this to everyone.  I just think the fisher-price rainforest jumperoo should be available in local stores as well as on-line.
Baby,5.0,Best on the market,Withings is the only monitor I found that does everything well. Alert functions and real time interaction worked flawlessly. I would recommend.
Baby,5.0,Love this!,"Fits a venti Starbucks without feeling like it's going to fall out, fits a 32oz Nalgene bottle too. Has a nice zippered pocket and fits my BOB perfectly."
Baby,5.0,Durable and Fancy,"I love this mobile, packed it away for my next baby. Loved the little remote that comes with it, so convenient for those nights when mommy just can't get up again.  Put my baby to sleep every time. :)"
Baby,5.0,Awesome,I think I paid like $7 for this and it fits my stroller perfectly (Baby Jogger City Mini GT).  It folds up fine with the stroller as well.  Costs a ton less than the 'official' one for my stroller and does a fine job.  Love it!
Baby,2.0,"seat doesn't spin, bug just flops over, and too tall for my larger-than-average 4 mo/old","The title pretty sums it up. i was really excited tog et this since all the reviews are so great, but maybe we got a defective one. the bug that is clearly shown in the photo as standing up straight and being swatable, literally is flopped all the way over the edge and completely invisible to baby.<br /><br />The seat doesn't spin at all - we have to yank it super hard to get it to move a couple degrees.<br /><br />No where on their site or in product descriptions does it say what size your kid needs to be in order to reach the floor at the lowest level. It just says they need to be able to hold their head up. Our 4 m/o daughter is in the 90th percentile for height and weight (15lbs and 25&#34;) so I assumed at least one of the settings would fit her - nope! she doesn't even come close to touching the floor. We had to put 2 huge cookbooks under her in order for her to be able to bounce.<br /><br />additionally, the toys aren't that interactive. the music is either on or off, and not controlled by baby's actions, and without the other toy that just flops over, there's not much to do but bounce.... if they can reach the floor."
Baby,5.0,Baby Wipes Case,I purchased this item to add to the &#34;wish list&#34; for my grandson as my daughter was expecting her first baby.  It is a wonderful product and I would heartily recommend it to anyone as a gift or addition to an already existing baby registry.
Baby,5.0,perfect for a new born,"This is perfect for a newborn, gives them something to hang onto and safe.  Wish i could find the dinosaur one though, THAT;S the one I wanted, the monkey is cute though."
Baby,3.0,Has it's issues; only worth it for wifi users,"First off, this thing will not work over wifi. I had to hardwire this to my network to get any use out of it. I also have trouble accessing the video feed with my phone. You'd think that this alone would be enough to make me return the monitor but the fact of the matter is that it works great at home or when connected to wifi remotely.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Family members can access video feed<br />Humidity readout helps bring comfort to baby when sick<br />Night vision works well and it's light varies in intensity depending if in use which is comforting as IR is harmful to the eyes<br />Works great at home<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wireless mode isn't consistent<br />Trouble access feed from phone network<br />Lag<br /><br />I find the audio and nightlight feature useless because I own another device that does this better, but I can see how someone looking for an all-in-one solution would utilize it."
Baby,3.0,so-so,"quality and ease of use wise, it's so-so only. not that fantastic. can live without it and just go for the normal baby wipes packaging."
Baby,4.0,Useful,"As described easy to use and holds a good amount of wipes, slight bigger than usual wipes cases but very well made. Recommend this product."
Baby,5.0,love this!,My son lives this jumper! Its great that it grows with him and has lots of activities to keep his attention. Holds up great and easy to clean
Baby,4.0,"Great product, bad seller","After doing months of research, my husband and I finally decided to purchase the Withings monitor system because it had everything we wanted: two-way communication, music, and (most importantly) wi-fi capable so we can could see our child when we're outside of the home. While our child hasn't been born yet, we've played with the system & works just as described.<br /><br />We are disappointed in the purchase because Amazon LLC said it was a &#34;NEW&#34; item, but when we opened the box there were no directions included (which we simply thought was a mistake, so we looked them up on the manufacturer's website) and someone else's information was always imputed into the system. It had someone else's child's name, their date of birth, email address, wi-fi info, etc. I immediately deleted all of their information just in case they could still be connected to the system. Very disappointed that it was not actually NEW but was already used. We would have returned it, but we're less than a week away from our due date and don't want to take any chances of not having one when our daughter is born."
Baby,5.0,hours of happy baby time,"we have a very active and curious 5 month old.  after several unsuccessful purchases in our quest to find the perfect activity station for our little one (and give Mom some R&R for 30 minutes each day) we finally found THE ONE.  he loves it!  if your child is a mover and shaker like ours, the Jumparoo is a home run."
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it,My baby loves it!  He is almost 5 months and is growing fast.  I wanted to get something that would entertain him while I cleaned the house because he cries every time I leave the room.this is the perfect distraction plus it helps him learn to balance and jump.
Baby,5.0,Love it,Love this rainforest jumper. Keeps my baby entertained and occupied. He loves all of the little gadgets he can look at and play with. So happy we purchased it!!!
Baby,5.0,Great for city select stroller!,"Finally, I found something that fits the City select. It is on the small side, but doesn't interfere whith folding the stroller and very sturdy for daily use."
Baby,4.0,Good quality product,"This musical mobile is a good quality product, I was impressed with how well the pieces were designed to fit together. The crib adapter is very secure and easy to use. You can't tell from the picture, but the animation is very good, with all of the palm leaves moving as well as the toys. The remote is handy also."
Baby,5.0,Great lamaze toy,We bought a very large selection of the lamaze developmental clip toys for our son when he was born and Dee Dee was the one he gravitated the most to.  She's a beautiful pink and her wings crinkle loudly.  Her legs are a fuzzy felt and she has a great little rattle.  Her tail has a piece of reflective paper in it but you really can't see anything when you look at it.  She was a great addition to the collection.
Baby,1.0,So scary- baby fell on his head!,"My son is almost 7 months old and this morning one of the three straps holding the Jumperoo came out of the holder and dumped him on his head, dangling from his legs which were still inside the harness. I am grateful that my son is medically ok, but it is unacceptable that something like this could happen to a child in a piece of equipment used exactly as directed. Buyer beware- don't risk your child's safety!"
Baby,2.0,Slides open in diaper bag,"The red closure button doesn't stay put well and often slides open in the diaper bag, which dries out the wipes.  The case is also bulkier than I expected."
Baby,3.0,Mixed reviews,"I really don't know what to say about this baby monitor. I was soooooo excited to have this baby monitor. We really wanted it to keep family and friends connected with the baby as we are far away<br /><br />Well the monitor arrived and we attempted to set it up. Our experience was:<br />Incomplete directions in box<br />Incomplete directions on site<br />No phone number given at all.  Anywhere<br />Only way to reach customer service is via email<br />Actually, email was sent before first attempt to set up with questions that were not covered in manual or online. It took 2 weeks for a reply.  And the late reply was incomplete.<br /><br />After 48 hours of utter frustration, trying everything possible I set up an appt with the Genius Bar at my local Apple store. The guys there were happy to help and eager to see this product working. 2 of them were there to help me and were not able to get this started. Grrrr<br />With the geniuses help, we wrote a note to withings customer service with specific product details and issues standing in the way of successful set up. The note was sent on July 1st. Today is July 12 and still no reply. This is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />I had no other choice than to return this to amazon. I wanted this product to work so I asked for a replacement. Amazon got a new one to be in 2 days. I was able to set the new one up on my own.<br /><br />So how is the product working?  Overall I like it. The camera is pretty good. The app works well on both of our iPhone and iPads. I love the fact that there is no separate unit to carry around. And it works just as well on wifi as it does on a g3 network out and about.<br /><br />I have MAJOR concerns about security. In order to share with others you must give them your email address and password. Then this person (grandma) has full controls to make account changes etc. there should be a way to let others watch/view only. Not make any changes.<br /><br />I will update this review once the baby comes and we can use it in real time. I am still not able to get all of the functions to work. It could be me but as of now no reply from the company.  Beyond frustrating."
Baby,1.0,Did even unpack the box...Disapointed,"Upon opening package, I noticed that item was not in new condition.<br /><br />There were several scuffs, scratches and grime all over the product.<br /><br />I ordered a replacement item, I will update the higher star rating if problem is resolved.<br /><br />Amazon was the seller/shipper :(<br /><br />Now, we need to wait for a replacement, we were really hoping to see our baby jumping it today."
Baby,5.0,Love these!,I love the Wubanub line of binkies! They are so cute and great for helping my little one learn to grab things and they are easy for me to grab too when she drops it. I have a couple of these now and will probably be getting more.
Baby,5.0,second one,"A few years ago I purchased this for my first granddaughter. She loved it and her little sister did too.<br />Now I've purchased the second one for my grandson, our number ten. He's still young but I know he's going to enjoy spinning and playing with this great toy."
Baby,1.0,DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY if you love your children!,"I'm exceptionally tech savvy and have years of IT experience.  This device is a waste and I returned it while vacationing. We bought it to help monitor our kids while being supervised by a new and never-tested local nanny service. I thank God that the local service has been exceptional as the Withings just, well, sucks! I did everything by the book and re-read all \\""instructions\\"" in total.  The thing just doesn't work.  \\""Registering\\"" online does nothing for my device connectivity but does create a new SPAM string. So... yea for that.<br /><br />I don't believe ANY of the positive reviews.  I tried Bluetooth and wi-fi and, even after registering directly on their site, got a DEAD monitor.  Sure, it lit up and beeped but never displayed my sleeping children.<br /><br />Please, do NOT even attempt to work with Withings.  They just suck.  Further, their app absolutely SUCKS and I'm shocked they're still in business.<br /><br />FYI: Amazon refunded my money BEFORE Withings even received the unit back from me.  THAT should tell you something.  Amazon should DROP this snake-oil product."
Baby,2.0,Barely functioned - expected better quality for the price,"After a ton of research and deliberating I finally caved and dropped the $260 for this baby monitor. I was reluctant because of the price but also excited because it has a lot of features and is sold in Apple stores (so it has to be good, right?).<br /><br />First impressions - packaging is very nice, like an Apple product. Unit construction is more solid than I expected. Hinge has nice resistance to it and the unit is hefty, as expensive electronics should feel.<br /><br />Setup - Stick in battery, plug in, powered on, connected to my home network, linked to it via Bluetooth with my iPad3, no problem. Very simple.<br /><br />Desktop/browser viewer - Sorry, THERE ISN'T ONE!! After video quality this was probably my second highest 'want' in an IP cam/baby monitor. I saw posts online asking Withings for a desktop/browser app over a YEAR ago; they say it's \\""in the works\\"" but they still don't have one! For $230+ you better have a desktop/browser viewer. Just ridiculous.<br /><br />Video Quality - In a word: bad. Over my very fast n-channel wireless home network I was literally getting 1fps. One. Frame. Per. Second. Trust me, I timed it. And the picture was hardly \\""HD\\"". It was blocky and horridly rendered, looked like 256 color mode or something. I tested the monitor out in the same room as the router, and in various other rooms with no improvement.<br /><br />No worries, I'll try hard-wiring it with an Ethernet cable. Connected the cable, reconfigured the baby monitor to use Ethernet only. Video quality: still crap. Okaaaay. I closed the unit, removed the battery to force power cycle. Powered it back up: a little better. Picture was slightly clearer and was running at ~5-10fps, slightly better, but hardly smooth. Also, there is a full 2-3 second delay between real time and what the monitor registers. Eh, annoying, but I can live with the delay. However, the FPS is just atrocious! I even Googled example footage online to see if I just had a bad unit or not - the videos I found were a little better than what I was getting but not impressive (which I expected after dropping $230+ on a baby monitor!!). I messed with router settings, QoS, port forwarding, all with no improvement.<br /><br />I also tested the IR night vision in a pitch-black room and the video was exactly what you'll find online: very washed-out as if the subject was in a spotlight. Other cams (like the Foscams) provide a much less intense IR illumination and light up more of the subject with a softer, more uniform light instead of a spotlight.<br /><br />A bit of background info: I am a computer engineer by trade and also buy and review a fair amount of tech and gadgets on the side. Also, my home wifi network is running off a Netgear R6300 and with Comcast I typically get 30-60Mbps down/5-8Mbps upload, so I don't think my setup is the problem.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good construction<br />- easy, simple setup<br />- lots of features: two-way mic, colored LEDs, plays music, humidity/temp sensor, movement and audio alerts<br /><br />Cons:<br />- video picture quality and FPS is VERY POOR, both over wireless and Ethernet<br />- NO DESKTOP APP/BROWSER VIEWER - cannot stress this one enough. I do not expect to solely check on my baby with an iOS device when I'm at home because of the battery drain, and because when I'm working I'll be on a desktop or my wife on a laptop. Withings has no excuse for not having a desktop app/browser viewer for this product, especially at the premium you pay for it (I mean, come on, I paid ~$200 for a solid wood crib on Amazon! The price is just absurd...).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Returning it and buying a Foscam FI8921. It is half the price, has pan/tilt option, better FPS, better video quality, better IR night vision, and has a browser viewer. I'm expecting setup with the 8921 will be a bit more intensive, but I will gladly spend more time getting it up and running than having to deal with the Withings baby monitor.<br /><br />There is aguy on youtube, channel name is \\""awkward hamster\\"" that reviews and uses a number of Foscams with his Apple products and the FI8921 looks like a MUCH better, cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I will update this review when I receive and test out the FI8921. Wish me luck!<br /><br />***EDIT (7/16/13)***<br />Received Foscam FI8921 last night and tested it out: VERY impressed.<br /><br />Setup: popped in CD and loaded Mac software, connected 8921 to Ethernet and had fullscreen HD video on my Mac in about sixty seconds. Awesome.<br /><br />Video Quality: Excellent! Video is amazingly crisp and definitely 720 quality. Video gets a bit blurry when panning/tilting but instantly regains focus when cam is not moving. Latency is very good - no more than 1/4 to 1/2 second delay from real time to feed displayed on screen. I am extremely pleased!<br /><br />Web UI: the browser interface (which I am testing in Safari on Mac OS 10.8.something) is very intuitive, organized, fast and packed with features. You can do everything from change the cam network settings, control pan/tilt, activate two way mic, IR lights, reboot camera, etc.<br /><br />iPhone/iPad App: I have not had a chance to connect to the cam via iOS app yet so stay tuned.<br /><br />Wireless Setup: My cam shipped with Firmware version 1.1.1.10. After following the PDF guide and trying multiple times I could not get the cam to connect to my wireless network. I quickly found the Foscam support forums, downloaded the new firmware for the FI8921 (version 1.1.1.13) and (after two tries) got the cam firmware upgraded and rebooted. Tried to connect to wireless again: BOOM. Worked first time. Video quality/fps is exactly the same as when connected via Ethernet. I am extremely pleased.<br /><br />Conclusions: So far, the Foscam FI8921 is an exceptional product that meets all of my criteria for an IP cam/baby monitor: high quality video, high fps, night vision, good price, browser interface, iOS apps, remote login ability.

Baby,5.0,Super cute,"I would love to buy all the Lamaze products, they are great for babies... My son loves it, it's the perfect toy to take"
Baby,5.0,Great Mobile,I love the remote control feature.  The music is very soothing.  I love the animals and how the leaves close slowly while the animals go round.  Very cute.  Would definitely recommend.
Baby,4.0,Lots to do,My baby is 4 months old and can almost touch the floor. She likes all the colors to look at. Easy to put together. Only down side is that only one station has lights and sounds.
Baby,1.0,it's quite useless. not child-proof.,"the case is quite shallow, you can't really fit in a lot of wipes.<br /><br />my son was playing with the red cover and it broke after 1 day.<br /><br />a waste of my money. should have read the other reviews before buying this."
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves It,"My 4 month old's feet can't touch the floor yet, even at the lowest height setting, but she loves the Jumperoo! She's jumping, smiling, and squealing whenever I put her in the Jumperoo. For one week now, the batteries are still running well and baby is still happy. Great activity to keep baby entertained, especially when you have things to do around the house!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my Baby Jogger City Mini Stroller,"I love this thing. It was so inexpensive and yet goes perfectly with my City Mini. Holds even larger bottles of water with room to spare. Has a mesh pocket with zipper on the inside too for keys or anything important you don't want to fall out which is well thought out and a great feature. I usually have a sippy cup on one side, a water bottle on the opposite side and have plenty of space in the middle for keys, wallet and my iPhone. Because it's soft, it also folds up with no problem when you put your stroller away."
Baby,5.0,Work great!!!,Great lids to store milk on your Avent bottles. Can easily be inserted and removed. I hand washed them and throw them in the sterilizer. They are very sturdy.
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,Fits stroller very well and a plus is its slightly insulated.  It was exactly what I needed for my trip!  The sturdy velcro straps are long enough to fit almost any umbrella stroller I would imagine!
Baby,4.0,Works well,"Ordered this to go with my Baby Jogger Summit XC.  Works well.  Holds 2 drinks, room in the middle for my phone, keys, boogie wipes or whatever, and there's a little outer pocket for garage door opener to fit on.  Does the job."
Baby,5.0,was perfect for the price,the couple we gave it to the husband is an app crazy person.  he loved it and started to set it up right away after the baby shower
Baby,4.0,Just what I needed,"I thought this was going to be another one of those cheap stroller accessories but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!  I use this for my citi mini double stroller and it is a perfect fit.  It is very sturdy and I love that it can actually hold a cup or bottle without it being flimsy like the other cheap parent consoles.  I gave it 4 stars because I wish it had more compartments.  Overall, I love it and wish I had found this sooner."
Baby,4.0,fast shipping new like said,fast shipping got faster than i thought i would. wish it was a little better on price and almost paid as much for shipping but good product and baby loves it !
Baby,5.0,Does a great job,"I needed a wipes case but don't use Huggies or other brands that give a travel case. I found most of the other cases on Amazon to be expensive or flimsy looking.  I have really liked this case. Yes, it's bulkier, but it also holds a ton of wipes (I have never had them dry out, though they are constantly being used and replaced, so rarely in for more than a week). The red dot does not come off easily, in my experience, and the case itself is easy to open for refills. I will actually be purchasing a second one for a back-up bag."
Baby,3.0,Met expectations,"Its a wonderful product, but Every now and then we have to restart it for it to log into the internet"
Baby,5.0,Excellent product,"I love this mobile - its easy to use, can be moved from place to place quickly and the remote control allows resetting without getting too close to the crib."
Baby,5.0,He loves it.,"Much larger than expected. Bright colors,different textures, and smaller toys built in. He loves playing with DeeDee and chewing him up."
Baby,5.0,Monkey Buddy,"I bought this for my son who was two months old. He's six months old now, and has yet to let go of it.<br />He plays with the monkey as much as he uses the pacifier. The feet of the monkey have beads in it, he uses it as a teether.<br />My only complaint is that you can't exchange the pacifier, once it breaks or you need a bigger size, you have to buy another one.<br />Over all LOVE IT."
Baby,5.0,We all love it!,"The look on our 5 month old's face when she discovered she could JUMP was great!  She really loves this jumperoo and has easily figured out how to turn the seat to play with all the toys.  We thought we'd get pretty annoyed with the elephant noise and sure enough, there was a point when we decided that we did, but now it's just background noise.  At first it was hard for just one person to get her in it because she wasn't keeping her legs straight enough but now she has it figured out that when it's jump time, the legs must go in straight.  Today we adjusted the height for the first time and it was pretty easy--just a quick check of the manual.  Overall, we're very happy with this purchase."
Baby,3.0,Bought it for it's portability/storage capabilty,"We considered other jumpers but bought this one because of it's relatively unique capability of folding down to a more compact footprint for storage and ease of moving. The unit does in fact collapse down at the base, however, attempting to move the unit while it is collapsed is nigh impossible without two people. Even then, the space savings is marginal. Without collapsing it, the unit is too large to move through standard door frames which makes it even more fun. Otherwise, the jumper is nice and has a lot of toys on it. Only problem on the activity side is the dragonfly with the flexible base that stands straight up in the pictures is completely flopped over and hanging over the side of the unit where baby can't even get to it. Not very stimulating in that regard. I would not purchase again."
Baby,2.0,My son is ambivalent...,"He hates the paci part but he loves the stuffed monkey part, so I guess it was a good buy. The paci is not detachable from the plush animal, so if your baby doesn't like Soothie style pacis, don't bother buy this. Just buy a stuffed animal instead!"
Baby,5.0,So cute,"So nice and small, soft and great for little hands. Will see how it holds up in a few months."
Baby,5.0,love it!,loved this stroller cup holder. it works on the bob stroller. very simple but just what you need. its actually a lot better than the britax stroller organizer that i purchased for the other stroller because the fabric is more stiff so your drinks don't lean over and spill. very happy with the purchase :)
Baby,5.0,gift,The website was very user friendly and the wubbanub was a perfect gift! Product was what the picture had shown and described.  Very happy with my purchase and the gift was a great success!
Baby,5.0,amazing!,since most strollers don't come with these anymore i love that this fits practically any stroller so i can just keep reusing it.
Baby,1.0,Bought to replace Baby Einstein,"Just bought this Fisher Price item to replace our Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper that was recalled today. Looks like a much safer alternative to the Baby Einstein model which \\""due to the 'sun' toy attachment on the activity jumper which can rebound with force and injure the infant, posing an impact hazard.\\"" Stick to the Fisher Price models!"
Baby,4.0,Great!,"I think it is near perfect and so much better than regular wipes, but the red dot pops off at times and the case pops open occasionally.  Near perfect"
Baby,5.0,Works great!,Works just perfectly as advertised- plenty of velcro to adjust to size of your stroller bars and has a wire inside to maintain the shape of the organizer.  I can fit up to 4 water bottles in it:)
Baby,2.0,Poor quality,"I bought these because my daughter enjoys other Lamaze brand toys. She is 4 months old and pulled the butterfly straight off the sock, then ripped his wings off."
Baby,3.0,It doesn't fit,"Very disappointed. The mobile looks good, but it doesn't fit on my son's convertible crib. It seems it's specifically for cribs with small railings."
Baby,5.0,"Love, love, love!!!","Infants notoriously spit out pacifiers - it's a fact.<br />We love the Wubbanub because it positions the pacifier in such a way that my daughter can stop sucking for a moment and it does not fall out and roll away.<br />At 14 weeks old, she will now slurp on the legs, tail and head of this thing and is learning to put the pacifier back in on her own - Don't leave home without it!!! :)"
Baby,1.0,"WARNING: Zero support by phone, by email 6 days!!","I bought this premium baby monitor a few months back, thinking that a high baby monitor would be backed by decent technical support (if needed). And boy was I wrong..<br />I woke up the other day to find my baby somehow got hold of the wire & ripped it. So I contacted Withings support. For starters they have no phone number, can't they cough up a 2-3 member support staff for the dozens of products they offer. So I tried e-mail support which took them 6 days to respond -6 DAYS-.<br />After 6 days they responded with the following:<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />My advise would be that you get one by yourself, here are the specs:<br /><br />- 2 amps output<br />- 5 V output<br />- micro-USB connector<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br /> | Withings<br />Turn on your well-being<br /><br />I contacted Withings because I wanted a OEM replacement, they didn't say they don't offer replacements, they just say go to Amazon. I bought a Withings product that why I'm contacting Withings!!! Shame on you Withings for not offering even half decent support with the high end products you sell."
Baby,5.0,Great item!,"I bought two of these: one for my daughter and one for a friend.  LOVE the Wubbanub!  My little girl was tiny, so other pacifiers could get lost so easily and fall down into her car seat or furniture.  Not the Wubbanub! I could lay it on her chest while the pacifier part was in her mouth, and she LOVED petting the fur! Also, on the rare occasion that she did drop it, it was MUCH easier to find than a pacifier alone!  HIGHLY recommend!"
Baby,3.0,"this is a good product, but low battery!!","This product is very good, but has two problems:<br />1 - Don't work off line (only wireless)<br />2 - The batery down on 15minutes."
Baby,5.0,Baby boy loves this!,Such a great mobile! Seems crazy that so many other mobiles are so expensive yet so cheaply made... This mobile has been awesome. My son loves to watch the spinning animals. He'll just look up at it and coo. So fun. Would definitely recommend this mobile.
Baby,3.0,Not bad,"It developed some pilling on the fabric, and the pacifier began to break off. It's not bad, though, overall. I'll consider getting another for my next child."
Baby,3.0,"It's cute, but...","I really like the look and feel of this product.  It feels heavy duty, like it won't break easily or fall apart.  After a few weeks of using it though, I notice I have to be very careful to put it in the diaper bag properly or it will slide open and dry out the wipes.  It's really easy to use and if you had a diaper bag that is configured differently than mine, I think it would be great.  I slide mine into a narrow side pocket in a Skip Hop diaper bag.  Since it's the same brand, it seems the two products should work better together, so that's my issue.  Otherwise I would give it five stars.  It's easy to use, easy to open, holds a good number of wipes without being bulky and it's cute."
Baby,5.0,This is just the cutest!,"I am obssessed with this product, and simply cant wait for my baby to come and play in it, it seems very durable and well worth the cost, I think it requires batteries, I didn't see it anywhere on the box, but when I try to play the music it doesnt play so I assume it does, I haven't set it up yet just waiting for my LO to come here!"
Baby,3.0,Would be Better if the Remote Worked,The bright colors and various shapes appeal to my grandson and the music volume is low enough to soothe and not excite.  I would like it better if there was a different selection of music - we usually just use the forest sounds - and if I could get the remote to operate.  Fresh batteries in the remote and adjusting the sensor on the main unit hasn't done the trick.
Baby,5.0,So cute,and connects to anything for play. Baby loves it and I love the flexibility. Bought it cause I needed to spend a few more dollars to get free shipping well worth it.
Baby,5.0,My baby loves this!,"My baby was having a really hard time learning to use a pacifier.  I read reviews on this product and saw others saying it helped their babies to have something to hold onto, so I decided to check it out.  It is awesome!  My baby was able to figure out how to hold onto the toy to keep the pacifier in her mouth, and then learned to keep it in through sucking.  Now at 5 months, she loves to hold and pet this as a lovee, and she chews on all of the monkeys limbs when she isn't in the mood to suck on the pacifier. Definitely a favorite toy in our house!"
Baby,5.0,Fits good!,"It fits good on my Chicco c6, holds cup, bottle, wallet, keys, most of the small items that you need. Can't beat the price also."
Baby,5.0,love it but...,i have purchased many of the lamaze play and grow animals and my grand triplets love them but i find the lion especially collects a lot of fuzz and dirt and looks dirty
Baby,1.0,I actually hated this product,"Ok, the good.  During the day, the quality of the video is great, and the sound quality is better than any other baby monitor I've seen or heard.  I also liked that it comes with a built in temperature and humidity sensor, which is a smart idea, and more baby monitors should incorporate this.<br /><br />Things I hated about this product:<br /><br />1. On the first night of using it, I accidentally left my wifi turned off on my iPhone.  I left the app open and running, and I ended up streaming 16 GB of data over the course the night.  16 GIGABYTES.  Luckily I have an unlimited data plan, if my wife had made the same mistake, it would have cost her somewhere on the order of $15,000 in overage charges based on her data plan.<br /><br />2. The night vision is horrible.  I can barely make my daughter out, and for several hours, couldn't tell her head from her stuffed bunny.  It's surprising how terrible the night vision is, considering this is a high end product.<br /><br />3. This device CONSTANTLY spams you with notifications and alerts.  Mostly, \\""Monitoring of your baby has ended.\\"", followed in two minutes by \\""You can now monitor your baby.\\""  (Apparently, whenever it loses the wifi signal for a second, you need to know right away, and end up getting two alerts.)  When I wake up in the morning, I'll usually have between 8 and 12 alerts, so I have to mute my phone if I want to sleep, which defeats the purpose of a baby monitor.  Note, this is after I disabled all of the alerts I could - you can configure alerts for sound in the room, movement in the room, temperature and humidity.  I turned all of these off because otherwise you get 20 alerts an hour, and even with those off, I get alerts all the damn time.  If my wife accidentally leaves the monitor on after my daughter's nap, I get spammed with dozens of alerts in the afternoons at work.  This is extremely annoying.<br /><br />4. There is a small status bar at the bottom of the screen that you can't move or get rid of.  Unfortunately, the way our room is set up, there is no way for us to position the camera so this bar is not at least partially obscuring our daughter when she sleeps.<br /><br />5. The video is very choppy most of the time, and usually more like a series of photos every few seconds.  Also, there is a noticeable delay, often as much as five seconds between what is happening on the camera and what is actually happening in the room.<br /><br />In general, this product feels half baked, and like it was released in a beta version.  It wouldn't take much for this to turn into a great product, but it's definitely not there yet.  I hated this baby monitor, and returned it to the store after around 10 days."
Baby,4.0,Practically Perfect in every way,"After hours of research and reading reviews we finally decided to get a Jumperoo instead of a stationary exersaucer. We bought this for our 3 month old daughter because she was no longer satisfied laying and playing with the toys on the activity gym; she wanted to be able to sit up. She is very active and needed something more stimulating now that she has mastered rolling over in both directions.<br /><br />We have had this for about 2 weeks and she has really enjoyed it. The only drawback is that it is made for a taller child. She is 24&#34; and her feet dangle about 2 inches off the ground even on the lowest height setting. We solved the problem by sliding a small box under her feet and now she can bounce herself while she plays. She has tons of fun and can usually play for 20-30 minutes at a time without getting bored. However, she is not yet able to turn herself to get to any of the other toys. Maybe when her feet can actually touch the floor.<br /><br />Like other reviews have mentioned, the butterfly toy is basically just a limp noodle. She can't even play with it because it dangles over the far side of the toy ring and she can't reach it. I am planning on calling Fisher Price to see if they will send a replacement. Also, the reason we picked this particular theme over others were the reviews that talked about how wonderful and stimulating all the toys were. She loves the toy in the front that makes music, even though it drives my husband crazy. But this is the only toy she will play with for a long period of time, the others just don't seem to hold her interest.<br /><br />Update 7/2/15: This is maybe one of the best baby items that I have ever spent money on. My 2nd child is 6 months old and she has been using it for the last 3 months and loves it. She is very fussy and and was colicy until she hit 6 months and this was the only way we could keep her from crying for hours on end. It has made it through almost a year's worth of use between my 2 kids and lookslike it is virtually brand new. I even bought a 2nd one to keep at my in-laws so that my daughter has something familiar when she stays with them. She is just now learning to bounce herself but she figured out how to turn herself and play with the toys right away. She is 27&#34; tall at 6 months and can easily touch the floor on the 2nd height setting. If anyone is debating between this and the evenflo jumper system, I would buy this one a million times over."
Baby,2.0,Didn't worked.  Bad service from manufacturer,"My brother bough this monitor and I tried it and really liked it.<br />It was a little overprice, but having the iPhone app as an interface was really handy and comfortable.<br /><br />I ordered one for me before our baby arrived and couldn't setup it.<br />I'm kind of a techie and tried several times with several iPhones and iPads and could not get it work.  Also tried contacting customer service, but the manufacturer does not have any contact phone, just an e-mail which I'm still waiting for an answer after three days.  I figured that such a pricey item might have a good customer service, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I will replace it and try a new one.  Hopefully this next one will work.<br /><br />Btw, my brother tripped with the charger cable (kind of short cable, and very ease to trip with) and the his charger broke, It's a mini usb charger, so it's very easy to find a new one, but I've read some other people having the same problem.<br /><br />Once you get it to work, the video quality is very good, the lullabies sound good too and there is a little bit of white noise from the mic.  If it'd really worked for me, or the customer service worked better, I would rate it 4 stars."
Baby,5.0,Very neat idea.,This pacifier is very nice and helps keep baby from losing paci on floor. Also doubles as a cute little toy monkey.
Baby,4.0,Does the job!,I like this holder.  I have a double citimini stroller which lacks anywhere to put anything!  This works great and is really easy to install.
Baby,5.0,Best toy ever!,"We got this for our baby boy almost two months ago- he was getting so \\""kicky\\"" all the time, that it was hard to hold on to him. This Jumperoo has been an absolute blessing! He LOVES it! I have the best photographs and video of him bouncing like crazy and giggling in it! The toys all seem to engage him well, the construction was easy, and the item seems to be very well made. It has had daily use for nearly two months, and I haven't witnessed any negative wear and tear. I do pull out the cloth chair several times a week to wash through the laundry, and again - no wear and tear at all. Highly recommend!"
Baby,4.0,Great for my little one,Aside from the fact that the stuffed toy is sewn onto the pacifier it's great for my 3 month old the paci doesn't bounce all over when he spits it out and he can put it back into his own mouth it's easy to find since it really can't fall behind him when he is in a swing or bouncy seat! Plus it's really cute. Wish it could detach from the paci just for better cleaning
Baby,5.0,good buy,"I was about to purchase the britax organizer and my wife found this one. I was glad she did so, because it is great. It is way better quality than what I expected. Has some steel wire as frame on one side. Good product."
Baby,5.0,Favorite,"One of my favorites for my children.  These are so easy for your baby to find when looking for them.  As they get older, they can hold onto them without them falling all over the place and getting dirty, and won't have to wake you up in the middle of the night if they misplace it, my babies always seemed to find it because of the stuffed animal at the end that is easy to grab.  Some of animals sit better then others - the frog, monkey, and cat have a flat stomach so they can sit flat on your infant, so keep that in mind. I have 2 of these for my second child and he's kept up with both of them."
Baby,5.0,great product,this is such a great product for the price.. its easy to manage and attach to the stroller ..it really fits well and is very handy..thanks!
Baby,5.0,Baby loves the crinkle sound!,"These are great!  We've been using them since about age 2 months (daughter is 4 months now).  She enjoys just picking them up and crinkling the bug's wings (not necessarily wearing them on her wrists).  We've strapped them around her feet, too, and she'll stare for long periods of time at them and kick like crazy!"
Baby,3.0,its ok,"My son love love loves his monkey pacifier.. I wish it would have a snap connection instead of being sewn onto the plush toy.. if the pacifer gets ruined, it would make more sense to just unsnap n connect a new one. I think it would be more worth the money that way aswell"
Baby,5.0,Sanity saver!,"We should have bought this sooner! If you are having any doubts about buying a Jumperoo, take the plunge...you will be so glad that you did! I am not one of those parents that buys everything under the sun for my babies, so it was hard for me to shell out the cash for a toy that we would use for less than 6 months. Several parents recommended this to me because our little guy loves to stand, and although I wish I could, I cannot hold him all day long. He loves it, I love it, it's a winner at our house!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The toys are attached so no playing pick up all day long<br />-It makes fun sounds<br />-Three adjustable heights<br />-There are toys to look at above baby so they have plenty of visual options. The toys also adjust to accommodate for different heights<br />-The chair very smoothly swivels! Awesome, so baby can turn him/herself around to play with new toys<br />-Bright colors for visual stimulation<br />-I wouldn't call it portable, but it semi-folds up if it needs to take up less room or be moved to another location<br />-Easy assembly (It does come in several pieces, assembly is required)<br />-It stands in a neat circle, doesn't have legs at awkward angles to trip over like similar products. It takes up a full corner in our living room (32&#34; in diameter & 32&#34; tall)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-My baby boy loves it so much that sometimes I forget that he has been in there too long :) Whoops! I call it my sanity saver because this is the only &#34;toy&#34; that he has been happy to play in for more than 5 minutes."
Baby,5.0,Just amazing,"this monitor is just amazing, the sound quality from the mic and from it's own speaker is great. Image quality is also great and the most important feature is the ability to see your baby from any place which any of your apple or android devices, also you can have three accounts to access the app and watch the baby, but still you can use a single account on all your personal devices.<br />The only issue is the delay due to the internet speed, which I hope will get solved with the new app updates"
Baby,5.0,Great idea!,At first our 1 month old didn't really like this but it comes in handy when she's still looking for something to put in her mouth after feedings.  This little gizmo will help put her right to sleep!  It also stays put so she can get it back in her mouth even when swaddled up.
Baby,5.0,Baby Girl found her feet!,What fun to watch baby girl discover her feet.  I love to introduce new toys to entertain my new grand daughter.  I have just as much fun watching her as she has playing with her feet.  Great purchase. I love all the Lamaze toys.
Baby,5.0,Works good,"I bought a stroller that had no cup holders or handle caddy so I got this with it. Fit on the stroller great. Only downside is that you have to unstrap at least one end b/c it doesn't fold with the stroller. It bends, but, I got sick of bending it back into shape when opening the stroller. It's held up to my abuse however, so that's something."
Baby,3.0,elephant ears hurt!,"The rebound from the elephant and the support bar just hurt my fingers!<br />i guess i am going to stick some sponge behind the ears.<br />another query was, one of the toy has scratched marks, as though man made trying to scratch off some markings or so. other than that, everything else is fine..."
Baby,3.0,Rattle sound isn't loud enough,"A friend of mine recommended these because her baby just loved them.  My daughter is mainly annoyed by them being on her wrists. Also the rattling sound isn't loud enough.  She can barely hear it, so doesn't connect that she is the one making the sound."
Baby,1.0,Horrible Product - Save Your Money & Time,I have spent at least 5 hours trying to get this product to work.  I am very computer literate and this has been a nightmare - it just does not work.  No telephone number for customer support.  Only way to get customer support is via email - and it takes 24 to 48 hours to get a response.  Save your time and money!
Baby,1.0,Poor quality,"Ok, the idea is good, but the way it's made is just awful. These are supposed to be put on baby's feet - maybe on the baby that never ever moves? Is not like a real sock with a foot shape so it doesn't stay on for baby to shake. And the material is horrific."
Baby,5.0,Loved it,"Love the product , i use it at all times. The only thing i would say its missing its the android friendly app"
Baby,5.0,baby boy loves it !,"i bought this for my 3 month old grandson on a recommendation from a friend. he's still to small to leave alone in it, but i sit with him and support him some with big books under his feet and it is amazing how strong his little legs have gotten. Its pretty cute to see his face and his struggle to stand..he's pretty pleased with himself. A GREAT INVESTMENT..it looked a little busy to me but he seems to love all the colors and the caribbean music !"
Baby,5.0,Works great.,"I have UPPA BABY and this works great on it. I didn's want to spend $30 on the uppa baby adapter, so this is awesome. It can hold 2 bottles, plenty of space in between and it seems to be made of a strong material."
Baby,2.0,They didn't stay on,Nice idea and we just dangle it in front of our baby and he plays with it that way. I like the idea but there's no elastic to it at all so he kicks his legs and they go flying off. I do like the Sassy 2 Piece Wrist Rattles Set Amazon sells although colors may vary and we ended up with the pink strawberry and bumble bee (we have a boy so we'd prefer every other one than that strawberry but it's cool).
Baby,5.0,love it!,Lots of different textures and sounds. Keeps my son entertained in the car and my older daughter plays with it too!
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,My grandson was only 4 month old the first time he tried it. He loves it. He had to be taken out of it against his will because he bounced so much he was making his little toes sore.
Baby,5.0,Very handy,I am very satisfied with my purchase! Having two kids I needed something to hold wipes and was easy to access. The red button does come open sometimes but it really hasn't affected my feelings for this product or my purchase. It was bigger than I had originally thought but I am still very pleased with my purchase.
Baby,5.0,So much fun!!,My 5 month old loves to jump in this! The seat is very easy to turn so I don't have to help him reach the other toys. I highly recommend this!
Baby,5.0,Mobile,Our granddaughter loved it as a baby & is now 2 1/2 & still loves the music when she goes to sleep at night!
Baby,5.0,my baby loves this paci and so do we!,My baby loves this paci as she has a friend in the crib with her. It's so cute bc we watch her pet the monkey while she's soothing herself to sleep. We love it bc it's big enough for her to find in the crib and she can place it into her mouth herself... We don't have to wake up as often to put the paci back in her mouth. We ended up buying 2 to have 'back-up' monkey when we have to clean one etc. I highly recommend this product.
Baby,5.0,Our Daughter's Favorite Pacifier,"These Wubbanub pacifiers are permanently attached to what appears to be Philips AVENT Soothie. The only pacifiers she likes are the ones made of the soft silicone, and having one attached to a plush toy gives her the ability to put it back into her mouth on her own before she develops the dexterity to put a regular pacifier back in her mouth. Since we bought this, we are awakened much less in the middle of the night!"
Baby,4.0,very cute,"I got this toy because my son loves the dragonfly Lamaze toy, and we wanted a second toy to hold his attention.  As cute as this one is, he doesn't like it as much as the dragonfly.  He does play with it though, and I think it is really cute and gallops great if a parent dangles it the right way."
Baby,5.0,My kid loves it,"it looks like it was designed thinking about the kid and not the parent, I love that!<br />Putting it together was supper easy and my kid was happy and jumping around in no time!"
Baby,1.0,Glitches,"My husband and I were really excited for this product and really wanted to make this work.  We loved that you could use your iPhones and iPads.  However, from the beginning we've had issues with glitches.  It constantly loses connection, stalls out, the sound stops working and the app will just freeze.  So annoying when you are trying to monitor your baby.  It will also lose connection in the middle of the night and sound an alarm that scares the crap out of you!  We are returning this for something that we can be a lot more confident in."
Baby,5.0,"Great Seller, great price, great product!",We use this all the time with wipes for our baby. Beats having to open a case and having them all fall out when trying to clean our baby. Simply slide the red cap back and pull of the wipe and everything else stays in. :)
Baby,4.0,Really like it,My only thing was it was bigger than expected lol.  I know that's an odd complaint but I'm using it to strap on to a stroller for quick grab purposes but other then that wipes stay moist and easy to use.
Baby,5.0,great product ..,Great product when you can't find the binky...my son loves it but pulls it out because he rather play with the monkey -_-
Baby,1.0,Stopped rotating,Same as some of the other reviews.  Worked great at first but after only 4 uses the mobile stopped rotating.  Very disappointing and still trying to figure out how to return because it was a gift and I don't have any receipts.  Boo.<br /><br />UPDATE: I called Fisher Price and they had me mail the base to them and they mailed me a new mobile.  The new one stopped working too!!!  I called Fisher Price again and they mailed me a refund coupon.  It was the biggest hassle being a new mother.  Do not buy this product.
Baby,1.0,I could not get it to go wireless!!!,I tried for two hours to set it up with my homes wireless system I could never get it to work! As long as it was connected to a LAN line/router it worked Ok... Loved the idea that you could move the camera around but even connected to the router it would keep on loading every couple of minutes... I am so disappointed!
Baby,5.0,So handy,"Carry anything with you on your walk, it holds 2 large bottles of water in the sides so they won't fall, the middle pocked has a zipper so small things wont get lost, strong velcro holds it to the handle of my BOB stroller. Great value for the price!!!"
Baby,5.0,Both childern loved it!!,"I love this jumperoo , I originally bought it 5 years ago for my fist born.  She loved it so much she would jump till she fell asleep lol.  When my now 6 month old was born i looked around for other jumpers but none really compared to this one.  The price is great, very steady and fun.  My son loves it and Im a happy mommy. Must have."
Baby,4.0,Bought it for my Sister,"My sister recently became a mother, and she wanted something to watch her newborn child. Knowing i was the most tech swavy of the family, she consulted me to find somthing hi-tech. Ive been peeping this particular device before she went into labor, primarily for it's unique wifi feature, that allows one to view , talk, and play music to their baby (or caregiver), regardless of where the parent or viewer is. The baby came sooner then expected, so my sister decided to buy it on her own. Here's the things he likes, and dislikes about it:<br /><br />Likes:<br />-The fact that she can see, talk, and play music (and lights) to her child, regardless if she's at work ( School teacher) or at the supermarket over a 3G, 4G, or WIFI connection.<br />- You can connect it to any wireless network, which means when she brings her over to my house, my mother can set the device next to her. Sometimes they have conversations through the damn box!<br />-Multiple users can view the video feed, but only two at a time. Her husband, and my mother can view the child through their iPhones and iPads.<br />-Included battery, which lasts two hours. Micro usb cable included.<br />-Installation is a breeze<br /><br />Dislikes (At the time of the writing)<br />- Well, only two people can view the video feed at once.<br />- The video delay ranges from 5 seconds to 11 seconds, regardless to whichever connection youre on, you could be upstairs in the bedroom in my house uising the fastest affordable  internet (I have a NETGEAR Wireless A/C router i bought in January, on a Comcast/Xfinity 50mbps internet connection)an youll still have a delay. This is bad when you wanna talk to whomever's watching your baby through the  two-way speaker. Frame rate could be better<br />- Taking it out the packaging (you understand me once you open the retail packging) is harder than breaking the included Micro USB cable. that micro USB port it so easy to break. Use a micro USB from a smartphone instead, and plug it into the wall. '<br />- Included battery ONLY lasts two hours.<br />-Instlation is a breeze, ntill you get the app! it gets GLITCHY! but with a bit of paitence, it will be done, and the monitor will work.<br /><br />So if you have MONEY, and you want the BEST possible way to observe your child, sibling, niece, nephew, godchild, foster child, etc. I suggest you invest in this monitor!o the wall.

Baby,2.0,Four month old seems easily frustrated by it,"So we had a jumper than hung from the door jam and my 4 month old just loves it. However, she can get overactive in it and actually hit her head on the side of the door post in one of her excited twirls. So I thought this would be a good replacement as the seat twists to explore different toys.  Now, my daughter is in the 95% percentile in height and her toes just barely hit the ground which added to the fact that once seated, her weight is too much (15.5 lbs) to propel the seat around to explore new toys.  The toys are kinda lame and only a few of them even entertain her.  I dont know how they get away with charging so much. It seems to be 3 times the price I should have paid."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,I just know that this hard plastic case is just perfect for my diaper bag.<br />It fits perfectly in the wipes pocket. (It's the Fisher price deluxe fast finder diaper bag)<br />It holds a good amount of wipes.<br />It looks very durable :-)
Baby,3.0,Wish there was a way to remove the pacifier,"We love the soothie pacifiers.  I was in search of a Wubbanub as soon as I realized my second child would actually take a pacifier.  I liked it for the cuteness, but was also looking for a way to keep the pacifier from popping out across the room.  I didn't realize that the pacifier doesn't actually detach from the stuffed animal.  Yes, you can handwash it, but I was hoping to be able to remove it for better sterilization purposes.  It's cute, but we tend to use the solitary pacifiers more often."
Baby,5.0,Pleased,"Nice toy and good seller. Baby seems to like it, but it's better for 4 months and older so they can jump and reach the ground."
Baby,5.0,Wish I bought this sooner,"I bought this after reading several other good reviews here on Amazon about it and I'm really glad I did. It was so cheap but it's good quality and fits on all our strollers. One of our strollers doesn't have any sort of parent caddy so I stopped using it until we got this. I need somewhere for my drink to go and other little odds and ends like keys and cell phone so they are handy. This works great!! It velcros on very securely. I highly recommend this, and you can't beat the price!"
Baby,5.0,Granddaughter loves.,We have our granddaughter during the day. She has been using the jumparoo for about two monthes. She laughs and plays with all the attachments. She gets great exercise and will be content for 30 or 40 min.
Baby,5.0,PERFECT!,I use the organizer with the Baby Jogger City Mini Single Stroller. Everything is perfect in size. Very convenient!<br />I recommend!
Baby,2.0,Fisher Price rainforest mobile,The mobile worked only a few times and then jammed and wouldn't turn unless i pushed it. Really disappointing as my baby hasn't been able to enjoy it.
Baby,5.0,Everything we had hoped,"Our daughter has loved this Jumperoo. She plays in it daily.  The variety of toys keeps her busy for 30-40 minutes at a time. The chair is very easy to wipe clean for a small mess and easily goes through the was for bigger messes.<br /><br />The only downside is that she is now five months and we still have to put a box under her feet, as even on the lowest setting she cannot touch the floor.<br /><br />All and all a great purchase."
Baby,5.0,Other use for a great product,"While this product is marketed for use with infant strollers, I use it with my golf push cart.  I found the beverage holder for my Bagboy push cart to have major design problems and was searching for a better alternative.  The Buggy Buddy fits the bill perfectly.<br />It is very sturdy, straps in below the cart handle bar and has room to securely hold two beverages.  I use two stainless steel vacuum insulated beverage holders.  The buddy keeps them in a convenient location, stretches to easily and securely hold them and fits below the handles.  The buddy also has a large compartment that makes for easy access to small accessories that I want to get to quickly.  There is a zippered compartment, though I don't really use it.<br />It's funny, that with the number of engineers working on golf accessories, there really aren't any that do what Diono's fine product does.<br />I would have appreciated this when my daughter was an infant, but am happy to have found this for my push cart.<br />Diono, I'd like to suggest you start a line of golf products.  You can just repackage this product for golfers who use a push cart with a wide handle."
Baby,5.0,This is actually a necessity!,"At first, I was very reluctant to buy this, now I don't regret it. I'm usually against buying unnecessary gizmos and gadgets invented to make life easier than it already is, but this one has proved to really help in a lot of areas!<br /><br />Convenience:<br />My son would always spit out (on accident) and lose his paci mid-sleep, so we find ourselves getting up many times a night just to put it back in his mouth. This acts a \\""paperweight,\\"" so when he spits it out, it still sits right at his lips, just incase he decides he wants it again. Over time, as he starts to gain more control over his hands, he's learned to grab the monkey, itself, and bring it closer to his mouth. He has also learned to recognize the feeling of his \\""monkey.\\"" If I place any other stuffed toy near him, he'll ignore it until he finds his monkey, lol.<br /><br />Efficiency:<br />Oh, and this is GREAT for never losing anymore pacifiers! We've lost 2 before we decided to buy this! Once we got this, we've never even come close to losing it since it's practically a toy!<br /><br />Avent SOOTHIE attached:<br />There IS one caveat -- don't buy this unless your baby ALREADY LIKES \\""Soothies\\"" (which is the type of pacifier that's attached to the stuffed toy). If your baby is already used to orthodontic pacis, he/she may not like switching over to this type of pacifier.<br /><br />This VS. clip-ons:<br />I like this more bc it also acts like a toy, and it helps their fine motor skills when they learn to grab and grip onto things. A clip-on may also get in the way when you're trying to pick them up or hold them. The toy also helps to avoid letting the nipple part touch surfaces.<br /><br />ONLY CON:<br />The pacifier is permanently attached, but this is only a minor issue to me. When washing the paci, I don't mind getting the toy a little wet. It dries pretty quickly. And I try to clean it as soon as it gets dirty from milk or anything else. I also wipe it down occasionally."
Baby,4.0,Works good,You get 6 which is a bonus since it only shows 2.<br />When I boiled them 2 of them warped but still made it work.
Baby,5.0,Absolutely adorable!,I just HAD to purchase this to go along with an  upcoming baby shower gift after watching another friend's 1 month old cuddle this sweet little monkey in his fists while sleeping away with the pacifier in his mouth. Seriously one of the sweetest sights!.  Perfect for not having pacifiers spit out and dropped in unsanitary places. Small enough for the littlest of babies but enough  to grow with. I will definitely be buying an assortment of these when my day comes to be a mother. :)
Baby,1.0,Bought a 2nd  mobile and still defective,"I purchased the same mobile, again, thinking I initially got a lemon. Well turns out the second mobile is flawed too. The music and lights work but the leaves stopped spinning after 1week. I made a complaint to fisher price and they said it would be forwarded to their q&a department. I'm disappointed because I had high hopes for this product based on earlier reviews. I'm now going with another brand and you should consider other options too."
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves this mobile,"This is the second rainforest mobile we have purchased.  The first was for grandchild number one 7 years ago.  The second was for grandchild number three.  It is a great value and both babies loved the animals, music, and lights.  It helped to soothe many nights."
Baby,2.0,Fantastic while it worked but broken in less than 2 months!!!,"I should probably begin by saying that this WAS a wonderful mobile.  Our son absolutely loved it and we hoped to be able to use it for our next child.  However, the motor in the mobile began to fade within the first month and was dead by the second!  At first we thought it was simply time to change the batteries since we'd used the mobile regularly.  Unfortunately, while the music and the lights in the base station still work perfectly, the mobile simply won't move.  We considered buying another one, but $20/month is a bit pricey for a mobile."
Baby,5.0,LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!,"My baby is in love with these wubbanubs!  The monkey is realllllly cute!  This was actually our 2nd monkey we bought.  We lost the first and had to have another.  We also have the giraffe, turtle, dinosaur, and new brights dinosaur, and brights lion.  All of them are darling.  Worked perfectly when he was little to help hold it in his mouth. Now, he is a year and he can find them in his crib easily if we wakes up."
Baby,5.0,Cute,Baby loves it. We attached it to his car seat and he doesn't seem to be bored of it even after seeing it every time he goes on a car ride. He is 6 months old.
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT!,My little girl loves this thing! I even bought the elephant one for her and ordered one for a friends baby! Great product!!
Baby,4.0,Functional but not necessary for us,I bought these thinking I was going to store milk in the bottles but ultimately ended up not pumping into the avent bottles despite purchasing the converter kit for the Medela pump.  They work as promised and are good value but I am now not using them.
Baby,4.0,Jump baby Jump,"it is all good. I just wish the setting and play tray was a bit wider, otherwise our babies are enjoying it."
Baby,5.0,Great for tummy time,wish I had this when my son was a little smaller but it does the job.  It keeps him on his tummy an entertained
Baby,5.0,Cute!,This is perfect for infants.  If it falls from their mouth they can get it back without it falling to the floor.
Baby,1.0,THE WORST!!,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MONITOR I HAVE EVER SEEN!! THERE IS ATLEAST A 10 SECOND DELAY AND THE UNIT IS CONSTANTLY BUFFERING OR DROPPING THE CONNECTION.  I CURRENTLY LIVE IN A 1-BEDROOM APARTMENT, HOW COULD THE CONNECTION DROP WHEN I AM ONLY 5 FEET AWAY AT ANY TIME!!! IF I COULD GIVE THIS A NEGATIVE REVIEW, I WOULD!! I DO NOT USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS, BUT THIS PRODUCT HAS SENT ME OVER THE EDGE, AND IF THIS HELPS JUST ONE PERSON FROM NOT PURCHASING THIS MONITOR, I WILL BE SATISFIED. MY BABY IS ONLY 2 WEEKS OLD - SO IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OVER USE.  I HAVE ONLY TRIED TO USE THE PRODUCT MAYBE 5 TIMES, WHICH AFTER EACH USE I AM LEFT MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED WITH MY RIDICULOUSLY OVER-PRICED AND UNDER SATISFIED PURCHASE. I WANTED SO MUCH TO LIKE THIS PRODUCT BUT CANNOT FIND ONE REDEEMING QUALITY ABOUT IT. AFTER MORE RESEARCH I HAVE NOW DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE SAMSUNG SEW-3037 BABY MONITOR AND AM IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL, MAYBE THEN I CAN HAVE SOME PIECE OF MIND!"
Baby,1.0,horrible product,"wow is this thing bad!  totally unreliable - difficult to configure - barely connects to the network and horrible, horrible slow customer support from withings...oh, and did I mention the errors using the iphone app are either in French or you cannot even understand them.  stay away from this product.  It is so bad that I will have to buy a separate baby monitor - this thing cannot be trust to monitor a baby."
Baby,2.0,Neat toy but not reliable,"It's a nifty monitor, and (at least with my iPhone), it works nicely -- most of the time.  I like the functionality it offers, but the stability is far from perfect.  It looses connection frequently and when their website goes down, it's difficult to connect at all.  Not cool when this happens in the middle of the night!  We are going to go buy a back up monitor tomorrow. :(  Cool toy, but not reliable enough to serve it's sole purpose. This was a gift, but I'm still disappointed someone had to shell out this much money for something that does not deliver.<br />Bottom line- if you want a cool and convenient way to monitor your baby with the device you already carry around with you- then this is it.  But if you want something you can trust will alert you when need be, I'd suggest getting something else (at least as a backup)."
Baby,5.0,So glad I got this one over the expensive one!,I am so glad I read the reviews and got this little caddy.  It is compact and holds everything I need.  It can hold a variety of bottle sizes.  I take my baby on a walk everyday in our Britax stroller and this complements it beautifully.  I am so glad I saved myself $20 and went with this one!
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Got it for my preemie grandson. Monkey lays on his chest and helps to keep the pacifier in his mouth.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,Bought one for a new granddaughter.  She loves it and it stimulates her to respond.  Just bought another for the upcoming Great Granddaughter.  Still in box and will be given at shower.
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,This was a perfect addition to the other items we have bought for our son. Whether he is happy or sad when he gets put into this he instantly becomes excited and dances to the music. Definitely worth the investment.
Baby,5.0,So happy I bought this,It was fairly simple to install and it is such a good thing to have a video monitor so I can watch whether my baby is awake or asleep....and if he is safe.  Love it
Baby,4.0,Good monitor for what it is.,"We got this to supplement the audio monitor that we already have.  Baby has taken to making noises throughout the night, but doesn't really wake up. This way we can check in on him to see if he is awake or just making noise.<br /><br />The decision point was that we could use our phones to watch the kid in his crib, rather than having yet another screen to look at or plug in.  This probably means that we are going to stay and iPhone family for a few more years. Set up was insanely easy, once I read that you need to actually plug it into the router before it would register on WiFi.  From there, it's no harder than setting up a wireless printer.<br /><br />It does take a few seconds (up to 30) to load the app and get a video feed, the quality is decent.  I like the infrared so we can see him at night.  Though it feels like we are watching a bad episode of Ghost Hunters or Paranormal Activity.  I half expect to see Toby open his room door or move the mobile at any moment.<br /><br /> Downside is that if you leave it running on your phone all the time it will eat through your battery just as fast as any other app; so keep that charger handy."
Baby,2.0,Not worth the $,"I bought the Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Casefor the stroller. At first it was easy to use, but you have to make sure that it's not too full or the red dot will not open.  Eventually the red dot will fall off... you can place it back into place, but it falls off frequently. Also when u place it into your diaper bag the red dot will move and open, exposing the wipes to air and dries them out, so when placing the case inside diaper bag you have to make sure that the red dot is closed which is annoying and not convenient at all. I think it's way over priced"
Baby,4.0,Good for the price.,"Good for the price.  I am rating it four stars as it did have a very bad odor for a few months, could not leave it in the house for a while.  It is great for going for walks, holding phones, mail, bottles, and our drinks.  Other than the smell, we like it."
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"Our grandson loves his jumperoo!!!! And so do our kids, they can actually get things done while he is having a blast! He bounces for hours at a time. I highly reccomend this item."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,"I love this thing, more like my son loves this a lot he is always holding it and everything.  we do not regret getting this that's for sure id recommend this to everyone."
Baby,5.0,Bought for my Car,"I have no kids. But searched endlessly for just the right thing I wanted to put on front seat of car, to be able to reach over and get stuff.... and when putting on breaks doesn't go flying off the seat. This was perfect and LOVE the Quality of it."
Baby,5.0,works for us,"this holds my drink, my son's sippy cup, his snack, my snack, keys, phone and wallet. I love it. Very durable"
Baby,5.0,Great addition to the stroller,"I consider this a must have for a stroller. It is much cheaper than other products out there, but I think it is much more functional and practical. It can comfortably hold two drinks, my phone, keys, and my sunglasses. I also put my credit card in the mesh part for safe keeping."
Baby,4.0,iBaby M3 Monitor,"I have been using this monitor for almost 2 years now and i love it . Easy to install and beautiful picture . I had an issue after reinstalled it on a new wifi network at my house , i was not able to view my baby on other wifi networks but the iBaby support team helped me solving this issue in not time ,instant replies  and detailed steps to follow . Now i can see my baby anytime and anywhere :)"
Baby,4.0,"Good idea, great price","I needed something quick and easy for my i'coo stroller.  It can hold wide bottles like the fat Dr. Browns as well as drinks for adults.  The zipper netting pocket is a cool idea for keeping id's and cards or a cell phone privately.  However I wish the middle compartment where you can store whatever, had a closure so you items placed in there won't get wet or people see what you have and while you're tending to baby, its easy for someone to steal and go.  (Sorry I'm from the &#34;concrete jungle aka New York City we think about things like that constantly lol).<br />Otherwise great idea for the high end strollers that doesn't have a cup holder, tray, or storage, etc."
Baby,5.0,works for avent's natural line,I'm happy with the sealing discs; this will be great for keeping milk in my natural avent bottles! So far loving them.
Baby,2.0,Your Baby Deserves Better,"Last week, Withings' servers went down, meaning every single Withings baby monitor out there stopped working. There was no message on Withing's Twitter account until hours later, and their site was down too. Even when the servers work, the baby monitor has a several second delay. The iPhone app behaves in a bizarre way with alerts sometimes coming in even after they're disabled. If you leave the app running, your battery will quickly drain. Almost every night, we lose the connection to the server and have come to rely on hearing the baby down the hall, not on the monitor.<br /><br />It sounds appealing to be able to monitor the baby even when you're not at home, but I would gladly sacrifice this feature for a local wireless connection that actually worked."
Baby,5.0,love it,"my little one has got some cheeks, and all other pacifiers would leave indention marks on them, this is the best, and little one absolutely loves it, ordered 2 others to keep in diaper bag and 1 and grandmas. Wont be caught without one"
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I bought it looking for a bigger portable wipe container, and after reading good reviews I didn't hesitate. Big waste of money, the red button does come out quite often and regardless of been properly sealed the wipes dried in a matter of days! I literally went to get wipes after 3-5 days of putting them in and they were dry! You live and you learn, stick to the one that comes with your Huggies wipes, they might be smaller but they keep the wipes moist and their easy to get to."
Baby,5.0,SO WORTH IT!,"My son LOVES bouncing up and down and playing in this jumperoo! The music is fun and upbeat and the colors are bright and cheerful. It was really easy to put together, and the fabric seat insert is easy to take off (and put back on) for washing. I was a little apprehensive at first about spending so much for this item (for $100 I was hoping he would really love it!! -- thankfully he does!), but it was SO worth it! This has been one of our best purchases for our baby! :)"
Baby,5.0,fits great,Fits my Britax b-ready stroller perfect!  Well made.  It has held up to constant summer use on all my strollers.
Baby,5.0,Granddaughter loves it!,"Our granddaughter loves this mobile!The music is nice,her favorite is the rain forest sounds!<br />She watches the leaves open and close,loves the monkey most of all!"
Baby,2.0,Very disappointed,"First off, they barely make any noise, and there is no flexibility to get them on my sons feet.  Cute idea, poor product.  I should have gone with the wrist rattles.  I won't buy Lamaze next time though!"
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,"FIrst of all, it was pretty easy for me to assemble. Once we put my son in it, he just started jumping! He jumps and jumps and is always smiling. Sometimes he stares at the animals and tries to grab them.<br />He always tried to pull himself up so I decided to buy a jumperoo. I'm thankful I bought this one and would gladly recommend it to others."
Baby,4.0,Great product for my child!!,"I would have given this product 5 stars but setting it up and taking it apart to wash is a bit difficult. The batteries are also hidden, making it hard to put in. Other than that I recommend this to anyone who has a froggie of a child (jumping up and down). My little girl loves it!!!"
Baby,1.0,Terrible,"We've owned this thing for over 6 months now, and I'm ready to declare that it is definitively terrible.  Withings tried so desperately to make this look like an Apple product, but it does anything but \\""just work\\"".  The connection drops all the time, it is impossible to view the feed for more than 5 seconds.  The video quality is terrible and insanely choppy.  The 'alerts' are useless because the thresholds are inconsistent.  And what happens if you're out of town for a couple days and the thing decides not to recognize your wifi network any longer?  Get ready for non-stop alerts about \\""not able to monitor your baby any longer\\"" until you can get home and unplug the thing.  This has happened twice and I literally had to un-install the app in order to get some peace and quiet.  Have tried factory-restoring it many times, no luck.  I was convinced for a while we had a lemon because I couldn't believe a product this bad would ever be declared ready for market, but Withings has never even responded to my request for a replacement so I guess I'll never know for sure.  You'd be better off using the $230 this thing costs to start a camp fire, at least you and your child would have something to smile about then."
Baby,5.0,My daughter loves it,"My 10 week old daughter LOVES this mobile. I can put her down in her crib and she'll lie there &#34;talking&#34;, cooing and even giggling for sometimes as long as 20 minutes, entertaining herself. She's so happy every time she sees it, even when I'm carrying her - if she catches sight of it, she lets out a little happy shriek and starts kicking and flailing her arms about excitedly.<br /><br />We didn't attach the felt leaves because the mechanism that waved the leaves kept getting stuck on our unit, and the little animals would in turn get stuck. So all we have on are the animals and the plastic leaves. Not a big deal. Still love this mobile!"
Baby,5.0,Baby approves!,This is my baby boy's favorite toy. We got it for him at around 2 months and at 4 months he still loves it. He loves to look it in the eyes and talk to it and of course gaze at himself in the mirror. He's recently started sucking on the red teether as well. Great toy!
Baby,5.0,great jumper,"My daughter loves this jumper! We bought it for her when she was 5months old and the first time we put her in it she started jumping immediately. All the toys keep her attention especially the lizard, sun and she loves to chew/suck on the fly. This has been a big help to me, I just move it to the kitchen and put her in it when I need to clean dishes or cook dinner."
Baby,5.0,Using on my baby jogger,I love this cup holder. I can keep an open can in it and it not spill (granted keep and eye out for bumps and dips). It keeps it shape and the three compartments plus the zipper pouch make this a great buy!
Baby,2.0,Not quite as technologically savvy as anticipated,"Product was returned as it was not as expected.  However, this does not mean that I will not pursue the next product by iBaby monitors when released.  Please note, the product performed as advertised; however, it did not meet my needs at this time.  I will purchase IBaby products in the future."
Baby,4.0,My granddaughter loves it,My granddaughter is 5 months old and is now able to touch the ground. She just loves to bounce and grab on to the toys. So much better than I imagined it.
Baby,5.0,My son loved this,He would not go to sleep without his Wubby! He always held on to the little animal like he was hugging it. Both my sons did this when they were little.
Baby,5.0,Great price and even greater quality,"I got this mobile after looking at a lot of others.  The music is very soft and comforting, and my daughter really pays attention to the thing as it moves.  It fits securely to the crib, and does not interfere with the bumper guard.  Fisher-Price makes a great product, and this is one of them."
Baby,4.0,So convenient...,This is a great product... Easily attaches to stroller and makes it easy to keep things within reach. Only thing I don't like is that I wish it was more versatile with the velcro to make it easier to attach to different stroller sizes.
Baby,5.0,My Monkey Loves His Monkey,"I bought this for my 4 month old as he had trouble maneuvering his regular pacifier.<br /><br />I am quite impressed at how well made the overall product is made. The monkey is soft and with beans in the hands and feet. The pacifier, which is a Soothie, the same kind they give you in hospitals, is very securely attached. I've tugged on it and have no concerns about it coming off.<br /><br />As I it comes with a Soothie, which is Monkey's favourite, he took to it right away. There was a slight learning curve in getting him used to it, but he quickly got the hang of it."
Baby,5.0,good,"This item is really very good, and I like it very much! It was really useful for me, thank you!"
Baby,4.0,technical support is great,"I had problems to set up the monitor and see muy baby from my office, the ilab helped me to figure up was going on and solve it."
Baby,5.0,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,Fits easily on any stroller and it gives you the extra storage that you always seem to need when you have little ones!
Baby,5.0,"Easy to use, durable and perfect for us!","This is the perfect addition to our stroller. It easily holds my water, my daughter's sippy cup, my phone, wallet, keys and a few other things. It's easy to put on and very durable!"
Baby,5.0,Great baby gift!,Bought this for a baby shower; it's really adorable.  Baby should love playing in this jumper!  This is a great baby gift.
Baby,5.0,Works great for our Family!!!,"When my husband came home with yet another gadget after or daughter was born I was very upset, I could not believe he purchased another monitor system when we already had one that was set up in each of the boys room and all he had to do is purchase another camera for our daughters room to be added. Our daughter is now two months old and I just downloaded the app onto my phone and iPad two weeks ago (yes that's how upset I was that I wanted nothing to do with the camera or app) and now I love it! I can be driving, in a store or at work and can see my lil princess. We like this camera so much we got another for our 19 month olds room. The picture is so clear, the sound is great and I love taking snapshots! Now I am thinking about replacing the one in my 5 year olds room so they are all on the same system. Although this product is not made by Apple but for Apple it is Awesome and we are a Apple Family!"
Baby,4.0,Stroller Cups / Storage,"Haven't used this yet.  Looks like it will accommodate a drink or medium water bottle with no problem.  Center storage large enough to hold small wallet, keys, cell phone, or snacks etc.  The wire frame keeps everything in place.  I think I will like using this item."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"OK.. everything is all right. All perfect, product is the same of the sale. Very beatiful and cool. I Recomend"
Baby,5.0,Love this,I love all skip hop products that I've encountered. This is no exception. Sturdier plastic than a lot of other dispensers I've seen. I don't use the slide on top because I kept forgetting to close it (absent minded new mommy).... Otherwise keeps a good amt of wipes handy and they stay moist for a good period of time in this container.
Baby,5.0,Glad I Chose This Organizer For My B-Agile...,"Over the pricier one made by the company that made my stroller. It does exactly what I need. It goes on easily and gets out of the way when I need to fold the stroller up. If you don't want the \\""Diono\\"" showing, simply turn it around and--poof!--no logo. That also puts the mesh, zippered pocket on the outside, closer to you. I would definitely recommend."
Baby,4.0,Great buy,"This is a great jumper and keeps my daughter entertained for a long time. You want to have some great laughs at your child, put them in this and when they figure out how to jump in it, it is priceless."
Baby,5.0,Perfect Stroller Organizer!,"I purchased this stroller organizer with the intention of using it on our future trip to WDW, but I find myself using it with our single stroller a Contours-Lite since it only came with a removable cup holder.  I love this organizer because it holds so much! I can keep a sippy cup, a can of soda, my keys and my cell phone all in the compartments at one time.  I usually keep a small lysol wipes in there as well to clean tables and door handles as needed.  This is easy on and off, so if you have multiple strollers you can switch between strollers often, very easily. We plan to use this with our stroller rental (Citi Mini Double) when we travel to Disney World fall of 2014. You can use it on one side of the double."
Baby,5.0,5 month daughter loves it,purchased this for my 5 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it. can jump and play from 30 mins to an hour in one sitting. very safe and colorful to keep her entertained.
Baby,2.0,Do not waste money on it,"The quality seems to be OK, but the use of this toy is somehow doubtful.<br />Both them based on other reviews,but our daughter, is not interested in them at all. Might be she will hold and shake them for 5 sec, but not more than that(Noe she is 17 months). When she was smaller she also was not paying attention to this toy."
Baby,5.0,Cute!,"Will be using this and another Wubbanub as a decoration on a centerpiece diaper cake and (ultimately) a gift for BFF's baby shower. These are small - perfect for a baby - I ordered a larger stuffed lion to sit on top of the cake as the topper. I wish the pacifier part came wrapped separately for hygiene's sake. FYI: This came packaged in a crinkly plastic bag with a cardboard tag. Not very pretty packaging, but you could make it cute!"
Baby,4.0,iBaby,"I love this camera, it is really nice and you can point to many different angles.<br />However the app is just ok, the image freezes a lot."
Baby,5.0,most amazing purchase,"My son looooooves this item, it is his security blanket. He takes his PAL everywhere :)<br />Will be ordering another one!"
Baby,5.0,Baby loves this vs exersaucer,"We were given a hand-me-down exersaucer which is great, however, it had way too many toys that it made my daughter cry. Also she wasn't heavy enough to make the exersaucer bounce so she just sorta stood there looking stunned.<br /><br />With this jumperoo - there aren't too many toys but enough that she stays entertained. Also because it's on bungee cords its intuitive for her to bounce up and down. It's a little tall for her (she's 25&#34;) even on the lowest setting but we just put some books under her feet and she's perfectly happy.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this toy for a baby who is just getting their jumping legs."
Baby,5.0,Classical music is a hit with my granddaughter.,I had no idea that the music selections were classical but it happens that this child loves the classics and demands to listen as she naps or goes to sleep at night.
Baby,5.0,I bought it for my future baby,I have yet to have my child play with it but it is totally adorable and can't wait to have my baby.
Baby,5.0,diono buggy organizer,"great quality for the price, attaches with velcro easily to a stroller, fabric sturdy, hold a bottle, keys and room for other items"
Baby,5.0,best pacifier,"You need to get more than one, because it becomes such a favorite. Our grandson loves his monkey. Before he could grasp, he could still pull it into him because of the attached toy. We have twin grandchildren, boy and girl. One is not into pacifiers, and her Wabbanub was never a hit, but the other had more trouble calming, and this helped him keep his needed soother in his mouth."
Baby,5.0,cutest chupon eva,I recomand this prodect to anyone it is so cute i got it for my nephew and i wasnt sure he'd like it since he only likes the chupon the hospital gave him and rejects all other but i decided to get it anyway and he loved it XD (chupon means pacifer in spanish)
Baby,5.0,great baby gift,"Wish I would have thought of this. They did not have them with my kids so after seeing my nephew with one, I thought they were great baby shower gifts. The moms have loved it."
Baby,5.0,Wish I had bought it sooner!,We bought this recently for our then 6 1/2 month old daughter.  She absolutely LOVES it!  She starts bouncing before we can even turn the sound on!  We have also seen a great deal of improvement in her leg strength.  It is slightly difficult to get her legs in the leg holes properly on the first try but that is a minor inconvenience and you get the hang of it after a while.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.
Baby,2.0,Too Small,"We own three of these types of mats, listed here in order from my favorite to least favorite.  Tiny Love Gymini Move & Play, Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym, and Fisher-Price Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym.<br /><br />Here's my comparison:  The first two, made by Tiny Love and Baby Einstein are very similar.  They both come with lots of toys to dangle, and you can also add your own.  They have lights and music which my son LOVES, and there is space to place other toys around my son for him to grab.  Both can fold flat in half easily without taking them apart and can store in between my couch and coffee table, so they are easily and quickly put away and taken out when needed.  Both are easy to wash, I just take off the arches and wash the mat part.  This is important if your baby spits up a lot like mine :)  I do not put them in the drier.  Here are the differences:  I like the Tiny Love mat better because it is much larger, so when my little guy starts to squirm around more, he will have more space to play.  Also when I lay next to him and talk to him, he can see me better with the Tiny Love mat (on the baby einstein mat, the toys are lower and closer together so they are always blocking him from seeing me).  Also, the Tiny Love mat is adjustable so that you can move the intersection of the two arches down so that your baby can look at the lights and music even during tummy time.  Since my son is not particularly fond of tummy time, this helps a lot.  The Tiny Love mat also has sides that fold up, which I haven't used yet but I'm thinking these might be useful when he starts playing with toys that can roll away but before he starts crawling.  The Baby Einstein mat comes with a little whale that you can prop baby up with for tummy time.  This doesn't work well for us because is is asymmetrical and he always ends of sliding to one side and becomes uncomfortable, so we don't use the whale.<br /><br />The third mat, made by Fisher Price, I really do not care for at all.  Is it so small that there is no space for me to place any toys around my son, nor can he move more that a few inches without being at the edge of the mat.  The arch dangles too low so toys suspended from it are nearly touching is face, although the arch is not directly over his face anyways so he doesn't even really care about those toys.  Although it's small, I would have to disassemble it in order to make it flat, which is not difficult but with a baby, I have better things to do, so it actually takes up more space to store than the other two I reviewed.  There are no lights and minimal music.  Disassembly to wash it is difficult since I have to take off the plastic sides.  The only thing my son likes about this mat is the mirror, which he looks at during tummy time.  (both other mats also have mirrors though)  Pretty  much, by son is better off just laying on a blanket."
Baby,5.0,Just what we needed!!,"My 2 month old has taken a pacifier since day 1 (almost a necessity for falling asleep), but we've always struggled with how to keep it in. His suck reflex is consistent with what he does on the breast so he pushes out some and doesn't just suck, resulting in a pacifier that would fall out every two seconds.  Our solution was to fold a burp cloth into a strip and then tuck the cloth around his chin/shoulders and the pacifier, holding the pacifier in place.  He could always push the paci out when he wanted to and it never covered his face tightly.  However, this was a pain in the butt and I was always a bit worried about the cloth covering the face too tightly (SIDS paranoia, anyone?).<br /><br />We got the Wubbanub today.  It was smaller than I expected (I was thinking beanie baby size) so I didn't think it would work too well.  I was also thinking it would be easier for him to grab when older, but he doesn't grab much right now so I wasn't holding my breath.  I thought he'd still just push it right out.  Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />We tried it for nap time, and....AMAZING! It didn't fall out at all.  I am watching a sleeping baby with a pacifier in his mouth, with no rigged up burp cloth contraption  to hold it there.  I'm in love."
Baby,5.0,great for baby jogger,"Went with this organizer for my City Versa and it works perfectly.  The cup holders are not hard to get your drinks into, like one reviewer claimed. Serves it's purpose, fits great, looks good, and I got it for like a quarter of what the Baby Jogger one goes for."
Baby,5.0,Working very well,"This product working very well over 3G network. Is very easy to install. I hope, in a near future this company will development a software for Android."
Baby,3.0,Much bigger than expected,I was expecting something about half the size of this.  It was too big for the diaper bag.  I ended up buying the Huggies travel case (that holds about 20 wipes).  This stays in the stroller instead.
Baby,5.0,My child loves it,The music is very nice and it stops automatically after a while. The noise tha makes the toys moving is not so high.
Baby,1.0,Wrist rattle,Hardly rattled. Baby loved the colors. Hung it on her baby seat and she loved seeing the colors. But I purchased it for a rattle which was a disappointment
Baby,5.0,Daughter loves it!,"I am so glad I bought this, my 6 month old loves the crinkly wings and mirror tail.  I am so glad I bought it!! Very well made and easy to wash."
Baby,5.0,An amazing product for new parents!,"I just LOVE this product. It gives us peace of mind when we're away from the baby. It's compact, look good when click onto the railing of the crib, and easy to travel with. The best feature for me is the \\""walkie talkie\\"" feature that allows you to talk/sing to the baby when you're not around. For my husband, he likes that he gets to watch the baby when he has a break at work, so he won't miss her too much.<br /><br />I also like the light feature that provides some sorts of hypnotizing effect when my baby is fussy.<br /><br />One thing I'm not really extremely happy with is the limited choices of the lullabies. However, my husband and I enjoy the soothing \\""ocean\\"" sound on it. Sometimes my husband fell asleep faster than the baby with the ocean waves...<br /><br />Overall, I love this product. And all my friends or family are amazed by this product, and wish there was something like this when their kids were little.<br /><br />Oh, one tip for the user, don't not shut down the monitor, just leave it ON all the time. It gives me troubles when I turned it on and off worrying that the electronic product is too close to my baby. Sometimes it doesn't connect well with a weak wifi connection."
Baby,5.0,Great for little ones!,"I highly recommend getting new babies a Wubbanub!  My daughter was always waking up in the night because her pacifier would fall out.  All we had to do was replace the pacifier and she fell asleep instantly.  Once we bought this, she was able to put the pacifier in her mouth on her own.  The extra body helps the baby develop those hand motor skills.<br /><br />I was originally worried about this thing on her face and SIDS but it is smaller than a Beanie Baby so it is really a non-issue.  It's also very cute to see the babies with this in their mouth.  My friends' kids have them too and love it."
Baby,4.0,Daughter Loves It,"Our daughter loves this mobile!  The animals turn and the leaves wave up and down.  Even when she is being held anywhere near it, she will stare at it waiting for it to move.  I was apprehensive when I ordered this mobile due to some of the reviews I read about it not working for very long or not fitting on the crib.  As for the problem of not working for very long, we have had this mobile for over a month now and it is still going strong.  It is unfortunate that some people have had trouble with it in that aspect because it really is a beautiful and entertaining product for baby.  And in terms of it not fitting on the crib, I just have to say that right on the box it says that it won't fit all cribs (specifically convertible cribs).  I think maybe that is just a matter of people not paying attention to the product features or doing their research.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that the plastic screw contraption that holds it onto the crib could possibly be a little sturdier.  I am confident that it is not going to break or come loose and fall on baby, but I think if they were going to focus on improving any part of the mobile, that would be it.<br /><br />Oh, and also:  the rainforest noises are great.  The classical music options:  not so great for anyone who is actually a fan of the beautiful sounds of classical.  My husband likes them just fine though so I suppose it is just a matter of personal taste."
Baby,5.0,fisher price rainforest jumperoo,"this product is rated very well, and I love the brightness and the design I think it will keep  him busy for awhile."
Baby,5.0,Great,"I love it, i bought this for my baby´s diapper. ts so resistant. I´ll defenitly buy another one for my makeup business. Im in love!"
Baby,2.0,My review may be tainted because of the packaging being so horrible....,"It arrived in the mail after a VERY long wait. Once it finally arrived, I was so excited I opened it right up to find the toy shoved into the plastic evelope with NO tags on it or anything that would show it was new. Small pieces of stuffing/fibers were sticking out of it all over. It smelled like the plastic envelop it was shipped in and overall was very disappointing.<br /><br />It was just not the quality I expected and feel I received on my other Lamaze toys (which we love - the Octopus and Peacock)."
Baby,4.0,Recommend this,"I have a city select and it works well.  I didn't want a humongous console, but wanted somewhere to put a few things and hold a drink.  Sometimes I need to adjust it because of the kind of handle my stroller has, but small price to pay.  It works great, is compact, and was inexpensive."
Baby,5.0,This is awesome for the price,I bought these for my Jogging stroller and it's awesome.  The price Is great.  I just bought a Britax brand for 30.00 for my new baby's Britax stroller and really they're about the same except this one is just a great deal.  Would definetly recommend it. Hands down.
Baby,4.0,"Wonderful montior, but POOR customer service!","I bought this monitor, less than a year ago. First thing first, I am deaf and I have 2 small hearing children and a hearing husband. For my situation after reading all these reviews, I went ahead and bought this monitor after my 2nd child was born because after using all the \\""deaf technology\\"" with my first child, it didn't help me when my children woke up from naps, in the mornings (my husband leaves early before we all are awake and I stay home with the kids) or hear my kids move around in the bedroom. I loved this monitor but after getting it through the glitches that comes with setting up anything new, it worked great, it is not perfect but it worked. I did have to plug it in and out(this part is what is broken) and it no longer plugs(the battery part/recharger) in anymore. I have been in touch with Withings, wrote a ticket over a week ago, been in touch with the IT person on FaceBook, but no avail to have anyone help me to answer any my questions AT ALL. You would think as expensive this product is, you'd have better customer service. I mean, I had to shell out every penny I had to buy this just to have a peace of mind while my kids were napping or in their room, rather than me checking on them every 15 mins which equals no peace of mind for mommy. I am just at the point now where I am frustrated about what to do to fix this monitor. I need this product fixed. If anyone has any suggestions/advice, it would be greatly appreciated! I have a hard time believing this product isn't supposed to last just a year. If that is the case, it is not worth it."
Baby,4.0,peek a boo,Love this mobile it is just what I was looking for. Well worth the price and the moving pieces with lights.
Baby,5.0,Best video baby monitor,Just the best overall features offered by any video monitor. 3G connectivity is awesome for a working Dad who just wants to check in on a sleeping baby back home.<br /><br />Customer service is excellent via twitter.
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves it.,"The attached toy helps keep the pacifier in the babies mouth, it also gives something for the LO to play with or hold. To clean, stick them in the washer and then sanitize them."
Baby,5.0,Love it.,I love this mobile.  It is actually a discontinued item so I was happy to see it here on Amazon.  My first child absolutely loved this mobile.  He would wake up in the middle of the night and turn it on himself.  That was of course when he was a bit older.  As a baby though he also enjoyed it.  He would sleep very well.  Some reviews say how quiet it is but I find that very refreshing.  I don't want a mobile blaring in my babies face or ear when he is trying to sleep.  I purchased this again for our newest edition.  My kids will be 5 years apart so I am hoping this baby loves it just as much as the first.
Baby,5.0,really nice love it,very colorful really cute chararters fast shipping really cute I knowmy baby will enjoy it nicest one I have found
Baby,5.0,Permanent addition to our UppaBaby Vista,"I inexplicably owned the Vista for two years before buying this and I regret waiting for so long. It fits, it folds, it keeps drinks upright and it hides my keys & phone from my toddler. Awesome. I also like the inner zipped pouch to stash parking structure tickets.<br /><br />I read that there was some concern that the actual cup holders are soft and don't provide enough support, but I've found that those cardboard sleeves from any coffee shop hold the cup holder up (and open) quite nicely.<br /><br />One thing to know if you're using this with the Vista, if you don't extend the handle then the Diono Buddy will get in the way when you recline the seat (when the seat is in the forward facing direction). Since my husband and I are both tall, we extend the handle so it's never been an issue for us."
Baby,2.0,Not fit,It looks good but tt does not really fit my stroller so that it doesn't stand still. I had to return it.
Baby,4.0,Good seal.,Those seals really prevent the bottles to leak. Very simple to use and to clean. It was a good thing to have in the baby's bag!
Baby,3.0,"Cool, but not worth $100.","This jumperoo is okay. Our daughter loves being in it for brief periods of time...5-15 minutes max. When she's in it, she loves it. At first, she didn't seem to know what to do with it, but now she's got the hang of it. The little blue elephant snaps back a little too forcefully for a baby toy, in my opinion. Though it hasn't happened yet, I can see the potential for her little fingers to get stuck between the elephant and the side bar. The dragonfly toy is super limp and just flops over, which is kind of lame.<br /><br />If you're a first time parent, invest your money in the Fisher Price Swing instead...we paid $100 for that on Amazon and it has proven to be worth EVERY penny. It's great for naps :)"
Baby,5.0,Bouncy Bouncy Bouncy,We bought this for my four month old daughter. The first day she used it she loved it so much she fell asleep in it. Now anytime she is in it she is just yelling with joy. So glad I got this for her!!!
Baby,5.0,Had this for my second daughter and want another for my soon to be here baby!,"I originally purchased this second hand for my second child and absolutely loved it! It was very easy to put together. I loved the fact that everything came off so you could clean it. It was a little bit of a pain to get the seat part off at first but once you figure it out it's not too bad at all. The batteries generally lasted a long time. She used it pretty much from when she was about 4 or 5 months old (with a pillow under her feet) until she was 9 or 10 months old (when she was able to walk), but she would still climb in it on her own at times until we got rid of it. It was a great investment and I am hoping to get another one for our next baby who will be here in January!"
Baby,4.0,"A Great, Functional Alternative to Brand-Name versions","I bought this to go with my Baby Jogger City Mini GT double stroller. I was seriously upset that the coordinating stroller console sold by Baby Jogger costs nearly $30. The price was right on this one. I take walks for about an hour every day with my babies, and this holds my water bottle, keys, garage door opener, phone, and has room to spare. I keep pepper spray and sometimes money in the zippered pouch, where these items remain out of sight. I would say 4 stars instead of 5 because it can slip around a bit on the stroller (again, this is a double stroller so this item isn't &#34;custom-made&#34; for it) and it takes some messing with the straps (but not much) to get it at the right height to fit the water bottle in without it being blocked by the stroller handle. Again, the price is right on and I find this useful."
Baby,4.0,A handy accessory!,It's helpful being able to have &#34;lids&#34; for the bottles other than nipples for when you either need to shake formula or store breastmilk in the fridge.
Baby,2.0,Doesn't spin well at all.,"Looks great, sounds great, but it struggles to spin. It sometimes will spin after I push it a few times, but needing to manually push it kind of defeats the purpose.  Brand new batteries doesn't seem to matter, the motor just isn't strong enough."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,I got this as a gift for a friend with a newborn baby.  She loved it for her little guy.
Baby,4.0,Fun entertainment for our son...gives mom a little break!,"We bought this jumperoo for our 3 month old son...he is a very curious/active little one & doesn't like playing on his back or tummy for more than 10-15 minutes at a time.....he seems to get bored quick....however; he is always happy when I was carrying him around...but that gets old real quick! I needed something else to entertain him for a few minutes a day so I could get a few things done around the house!<br /><br />At first he only liked being in the jumperoo for 5-10minutes....but after a few weeks he can now handle about 20 minutes in the jumperoo before he gets bored.<br /><br />CON - my son is of average height according to Dr BUT his legs are still not long enough/his feet do not touch the ground (he is now almost 5months old...my husband places a thick book underneath his legs for his feet to touch)...We do have it on the lowest height setting....I am hoping he will grow into the jumperoo soon...like I said he is not on the short side.  My husband says the toys are a little cheap for the price but our son seems to like them just fine.  I do wish there were a few other things to entertain him....the push button that pops up the tiger could have been something else more entertaining. The tiger barely pops up.<br />Overall, I am happy with this jumperoo."
Baby,5.0,Loved It!,"My Son loves it and can't let it go, he always has this one or the Giraffe Wubbanub. He has his binki and stuffed animal in one."
Baby,3.0,Fun product,"Just like any new tech its a bit glitchy and slow.  Over all I am happy with it and use it regularly.<br /><br />My first one broke with in 3 weeks,  the video went all distorted with rainbow colors.  Withings support was USELESS,  after 3 attempts to contact them they claimed I must of dropped it &#34;which I did NOT&#34;,  they made no offer to help me.  Lucky Amazon is awesome, I was able to return and have it exchanged by Amazon."
Baby,5.0,Can't Live Without This!,My daughter loves her Wubbanub. I give this as a gift now to every new mom I know. I don't know if it's good or bad but my 19 month old will not sleep without this so we had to get a backup just in case so we are never without one! It's very soothing to her and she loves it!
Baby,5.0,Volume Sufficient,"As others have said, this mobile is not very loud but when you have it in a quiet nursery I do feel that the volume is appropriate and just right for helping baby fall asleep. My daughter loved this."
Baby,5.0,wow this is a super deluxe crib mobile!,"the leaves move up and down, the animals are bright and colorful.  the music is OK its like an mp 3 but not real instruments, the baby likes it.  The rain-forest noise is very quiet, she does not like it(crickets and monkeys).  The remote doesn't work incredibly well, but I have not tried to change the batteries.  you can choose light, music or motion, or any combo of those three.  The top is removable for when you baby is older. The batteries have lasted in excess of 13 weeks so far.  As a note you must have this thing on a crib with bars and spaces. it attaches by screwing thought a space between the bars, so you can't attach it to a standard pack and play or co-sleeper."
Baby,5.0,YES! Get it!,"I have purchased 3 different &#34;parent consoles&#34; for my two strollers. This is the one only one we haven't sold off at a garage sale. This one is THE BEST. It's too bad it was the third one we tried, if we'd tried it first we would have been finished searching and saved money! It's thick canvas material is sturdy and cleans easily. It hold my big jug of water, my cell, and snacks with ease. The velcro straps are infinitely adjustable, which makes switching between small stroller and jogger a breeze. If you're looking for a really awesome and affordable stroller console you have found it!"
Baby,5.0,Good little organizer,I researched all the options before I picked this one.  I didn't think we needed all the bells and whistles that some of the other organizers have - we just needed somewhere to stick our phones/wallets and a drink or a bottle and this does it.  We haven't had the fancier ones so maybe we don't know what we are missing but this organizer works perfectly well for us.
Baby,4.0,I liked it!,I liked the price it was easy to attach to the stroller.  It holds just enough stuff that you may need to be convenient.  The quality is exceeded my expectations.
Baby,4.0,Awesome jumper,"It's a really good jumper. Entertains my baby for a while...he just gets easily bored. My only complaint is that I wish it were easier to place my baby in the seat (his feet can never get through the holes the first go around) and haul around from room to room. Other than that, it's a great toy that I'm sure he will learn to love just like all his other toys that he gets bored with initially and then later becomes infatuated with."
Baby,5.0,The only pacifier my son will take!,"My son has had a hard time keeping pacifiers in his mouth since he was born. I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. It doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps tremendously. If he is reclined, or in his car seat, it sits on his chest and stays within reach of his mouth so that he has access to it. It has become the only pacifier that he will use!"
Baby,5.0,What an adorable jumperoo,I loved the colors and the sounds on this jumperoo.  I have to say unfortunately that it did not adjust short enough for my granddaughter is extremely healthy but does not weigh enough to be able to touch the floor.  I am keeping it in hopes that even after she is walking they will be able to get her to use this to jump in if she can then touch the floor.
Baby,5.0,My grandson loved it!,"However, unfortunately we lost it in the store while shopping.  No one turned it in and we were extremely disappointed.  So we bought another.  Love the new one just as much."
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,The leaves are adorable.  The music is so relaxing.  My grandson loves it!!!  Easy to assemble and fun to own
Baby,5.0,Every baby needs one of these!,Bought this bc my friend recommend it. I thought my 3 month old would eventually grow into it but he loved it from the get go! It was super easy to assemble and well worth the money. I wish I could upload a video of him jumping in it. It's super cute!
Baby,5.0,love it!,I bought these for a baby shower monkey theme gift basket I made and it looked so cute! thanks so much
Baby,5.0,Great addition to umbrella strollers,"We got this to use with an umbrella stroller that didn't have a cup holder.  It goes on easy and works well with many cups and it's nice to have a place to put the garage door opener or keys when going on walks.<br /><br />The top of the caddy has a wire that runs through it which can be easily shaped or deformed as necessary to adapt to cups or allow the stroller to fold up or expand.<br /><br />The one issue with this caddy is that when it is attached to your stroller and you fold the stroller up, the velcro loops can slide down over the joints that allow the stroller to open and close making it difficult to re-open the stroller without first sliding the caddy back up.  Once you realize this can happen it's not that big of a deal."
Baby,5.0,Works great on my Britax B-Agile,"I am so happy that I decided to purchase this item vs the Britax version (which costs 4x more!!) It fits great and looks nice. Also, the DIONO wording is smaller than what is shown on the above picture."
Baby,3.0,Quirky but ok,"I never have managed to connect to it through the Internet, but finally got it working with my network after moving the router.  Alarms had to be set way low or were constantly going off. Waited too long to return it so will make do.  On the plus side, customer service was really pleasant , calling me back to explain that it needed to be used with my iPad or iPhone, not the desktop PCM."
Baby,5.0,great product !,"Fits my Britain B-agile stroller, and holds my giant 30 oz cup of water I carry everywhere. Great product, and the price makes it that much better!"
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"I have the city select by baby jogger and this fit perfectly! It's so nice to beable to hold drinks, my phone, whatever I really need to, it can hold a ton! Shipping was super fast as well!"
Baby,5.0,Good product,My son loves to grab the money while sucking on the pacifer. The monkey keeps him entertained and very happy.
Baby,1.0,Terrible Idea,"I thought this would be a great idea for a young baby that can not hold his pacifier. It turned out to be a terrible idea and a waste of money. Directions are to wash the pacifier in warm soapy water and wash the monkey in the machine (see the issue?). The pacifier is sewn into the monkey's mouth so if you want to change the pacifier it can't be done unless you want to remove the stitching and sew in a new one.<br /><br />Also, the monkey looked much larger in the pictures; it's actually very small.<br /><br />This is a good idea that needs some imagination to make it workable."
Baby,5.0,Does the job.,"We bought this for our trip to Disneyland.  Held our maps, drinks, etc.  It's attached to an umbrella stroller, and we don't have to take it apart when we fold it.  It kinda adjusts itself when we fold the stroller."
Baby,5.0,Works just like it advertises,"Excellent product, it is amazing to be able to see your little one from where ever you are and know they are ok"
Baby,5.0,Favorite teether,This teether toy has helped a lot especially now that his teething is peaking. I love the different sounds it plays as a distraction from the discomfort he gets while teething.
Baby,5.0,Great,This is a Very good product.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  They are Great for traveling with bottles.
Baby,5.0,My baby loves this!,"We originally bought an Exersaucer for my daughter, but it was so big and bulky that she had trouble reaching all the \\""stuff\\"" on it and it was stiff enough that she really couldn't bounce much at all.  My daughter is small for 8 months, around 15 lbs, so that may be a factor.  This one is PERFECT!  She can reach everything and bounce even on the smallest baby setting, but there's plenty of room to grow by adjusting the cords on the sides.  She likes all the toys thus far still after several weeks.  I don't bother folding it up normally, but it's a nice option for when we are having guests and want our house to look more like a home and less like BabiesRUs!  This is nice though because it's a LOT lighter weight than the Exersaucer, which was so darn heavy I pretty much had to leave it in one place.  This one is light enough that it's not a chore to carry it from room to room, so we're able to get a lot more use out of it!"
Baby,3.0,This product is ok,My son seems to like it but from the description I thought it would be more like a beanie baby last like a stuffed animal I also thought you could detach the pacifier part but I was wrong The pacifier is sewed to the animal but over all we are happy also our wubanub arrived quickly and new in the box
Baby,4.0,No English manuel included! baby loved it! but it broke in two months!,"Took a star off only because we didn't find an English manual only Spanish, it took my husband a little longer to assemble.<br /><br />Our LO really love the jumperoo, it's the colors!, the sounds! the toys on it! and it can also bounce!  He loved it!  He's basically on it everyday but we limit his time to 5-10 minutes a day that's all.  We also put a sheep pillow/mat for his little feet.  But the jumperoo actually broke after 2 months use.  Our LO is only around 50-75 percentile.  he was really sad the day one of the spring broke.<br /><br />Amazon should will give customer a better pricing plan.  If a customer purchase something a day or two before an item's price drop they should give them a price adjustment.  They haven't even ship out the package yet and they wouldn't adjust it."
Baby,1.0,Over Priced and doesn't work very well :(,"Was excited to get this...after 4 months it stopped working customer service was horrible to deal with after weeks of emailing they finally sent me a new but I had to send mine in first for them to review it.<br /><br />Pros: you can use it while your away from the house bc it's on your iPhone (when it works)<br /><br />Cons: doesn't work half the time you have to continue to reset it for it to pick up your internet signal<br /><br />At night the picture goes in and out..flashing from the picture of the baby to a black screen<br /><br />You can set it on alert bc it would keep you up all night long, continually alerts with any humidity and climate changes (everyone ac kicks on it comes on)<br /><br />I never write bad reviews I just wish I would have known before dropping over 200 ;("
Baby,5.0,Great fun,Was easy to assemble and seems to be well made. Lot of fun for grand child as well as grandparents
Baby,5.0,Great purchase,My daughter (17 weeks old) loves this item.  The colors are perfect for her vision and I put this on anything that hangs.
Baby,5.0,Great quality and price!,"Originally bought the BOB caddy for my BOB stroller, but returned it due to defects in the webbing which made it unusable.  Then Amazon suspended sales of the BOB caddy (I assume b/c others had same issue), so I got this one instead... SO glad I did!!  The quality and design are both much better than the BOB version and it fits my jogger perfectly.  LOVE IT!!  I paid almost $15 for it, so seeing it now at less than $7, it's a steal.  Definitely get this one!  I'd still pay the $15 for it and am tempted to buy one at this lower price just to have an extra on hand... but after 4 months of almost daily use mine still looks brand new."
Baby,2.0,Disappointed,After much research we decided this was the best baby moniter.  In theory it was but after about a month it constantly would disconnect and you couldn't use it. Very disappointed.
Baby,4.0,A Pacifier and a Toy All in One,"Not only is this pacifier very cute, but also it doesn't get lost so easily as do unadorned pacifiers.  It's a little too big and bulky for newborns.  However, they will grow into it and appreciate the cuddly monkey."
Baby,5.0,Great Monitor for our baby,"This is our second baby monitor and my wife and I just love it.<br /><br />It set itself up almost effortlessly and with their app download from the apple app store, easily synced with both of our iPhones and iPads and allowed for viewing the feed whether we were connected through our local LAN or over the internet. We love that it shows temperature and humidity, and that we can pop on my sons favorite lullaby right from the app. With Withings new web based viewing, its encouraging to know that they view this as an active product and are continuing to make it better and more feature rich.<br /><br />The one annoying feature is that it detects significant changes in light levels as movement in the room, and sends annoyingly loud notifications to all of our connected devices even when there is no one in the room.<br /><br />Also, we have mounted the camera to the wall over my sons crib, but as it plugs into an electrical outlet, my son loves to try and reach through the bars and pull on the wires, dislodging the camera. We have had to move his crib away from the wall to protect the camera wires from his playing/chewing.<br /><br />Overall we love this product and would recommend it to any parent looking for a great monitoring solution for their child."
Baby,4.0,Gift for a neighbor's baby,The infant seemed to enjoy them and they appear safely constructed. That's about all that we can say about them.
Baby,2.0,Cheap and Does not stay closed,The case seemed durable but after a couple of weeks of use the red cap broke off and the case would not stay closed.
Baby,5.0,A++++++++++ Product Would Buy Again.,These are the best pacifiers by far for new born/ infants... It makes it easier to hold the pacifier in the baby's mouth and for them to find it in the middle of the night. The little animals give them something to hold onto for comfort...  We bought at least 10 of these on Amazon for our daughter and as gifts...  A+++++ product...
Baby,1.0,Doesn't stay closed,"I just got this item in the mail and even in the packaging the red dot slides and doesn't stay tightly closed.  I read that in the other reviews people said the dot slid to easily and I wish I would have listened.  I didn't even open them, after seeing that it doesn't stay closed at all I decided to send them back. I found something I like a bunch better, the OXO tot on the go wipes dispenser.  It is the same size, has the string to attach it to things and has a locking case.  Sorry Skip hop, this design isn't that great!"
Baby,5.0,Love it so much we purchased it twice!,"We purchased the Rainforest Jumperoo for our first son and he LOVED it!  Unfortunately, during a move, the movers lost the main plastic ring that the seat and toys fit into, and hangs from the springs.  It is not a piece that Fisher-Price offers for replacement, so we had to purchase a whole new Jumperoo when our second son arrived.  He is 5m old and LOVES it!  He is above the 99% in height and weight, so he fits perfectly and will have many months of entertainment.  I like that it gives him a place to play that isn't laying down or sitting at an incline."
Baby,1.0,Not able to open the remote screw.,"I tried to unscrew the battery case of the remote for mote than a hour but it is stuck, this is going back to amazon rightaway. One of my worst purchases from amazon. This is not what I expected from them."
Baby,5.0,Works great with Britax b-agile,"Save your money and buy this stroller organizer! It is just as nice and functional as the Britax, only a ton cheaper!"
Baby,5.0,Nice,Great toys for curious kids.  Interesting sounds and vibrant colors help stir their imagination.  Very good product for the price.
Baby,2.0,Very bulky and opens by itself,"I have a few things from skip hop which I really like, so I ordered the wipe dispenser too. I find it very big and bulky, much worse than to carry your pack of wipes in the diaper bag, so no advantage there. Then, I sometimes find it open in the diaper bag (the red dot slides easily when you  try to get something from the bag), which results in dried out wipes. Then, when you want to use it outside of the bag it's not as easy to get the wipes out with one hand as it should be, but that might be a general wipe dispenser problem..."
Baby,3.0,OK,I have used this item for almost a year at this point and I would review it as just OK.  The only benefit to this item is that you can attach it to your stroller etc for easy access.  Not the best options for sticking in your diaper bag because the red sliding button opens when you are pushing into a pocket.
Baby,5.0,cuteness,My grandbaby loves this.  As a newborn this little money helps hold his paci in place whether he is in his bed or in the carseat...so cute!!
Baby,4.0,Keeps our baby occupied,"Our baby loves this, even from the first time we put him in. He loves the spinning sun and really enjoys jumping in it. It keeps him occupied long enough for me to get some things done in the kitchen while watching him."
Baby,5.0,Daughter Loves It!,"This may be the best $100 i ever spent. Bought it for my daughter when she was 5 months old. She liked it straight away, but it took her a few goes before she started to jump. She's now 6 months and LOVES it. She jumps like crazy and smiles and laughs in it. I love that I can put her in it and for 10 minutes i know she can't go anywhere so I can get a couple of quick chores done (whilst checking in on her every couple of minutes of course). The only downside I suppose is that it's quite bulky and not really easy to move, so it has just stayed in the same place in our living room. But it's definitely worth it for how much she loves it. Would recommend."
Baby,1.0,Unreliable,"I wanted to like this product, but out first device failed an we ended up connected to a couple's baby monitor in France. After the lengthy return process, our second one showed up and worked great for a little while. Now, it will not boot up. Just sits there and flashes a blue light. We've tried every troubleshooting technique possible with no luck. How can a company make such low quality products for something as important as your child? If I can't get my money back, I really don't care anymore. This is the last time I consider a product from Withings. I just want something that works."
Baby,4.0,Baby monitoring in the digital age!!,"This is a great way to monitor your baby (video, temperature/humidity reads, music, lights).  I highly recommend the investment for any new parents - instead of just knowing that your baby is crying or making noise, the way old baby monitors work, you can actually see what they are doing and know if you should go in and disturb them or let them be.  We have been using the baby monitor since birth and give it much credit in getting our baby to sleep through the night at 2 months!!  We knew when to disturb him and when to let him fall back asleep.  And I love that I can check up on him sleeping in his crib while at work or traveling.  A really great product!!<br /><br />The only \\""watch-out\\"" I would offer (and hope Withings fixes soon) is that the app works better on iOS than it does on Android.  Given that the majority of smartphones are Android, it would make sense to have better functionality there."
Baby,4.0,Diono buggy buddy organizer,"This is so much better than those 2 cup holders that came with the graco snap and go. It holds multiple drinks and items of any size and is easily detached. looks nice and well made. One of my new favorite baby items.<br /><br />Update: It worked great for the snap and go (which I used until 15 months), but I got a city select baby jogger and it's too small. I can still use it temporarily but I plan on getting something else. I may pass it on or try to find another use for it (and if I do, I'll update)"
Baby,4.0,mostly works well,"Mostly works well, but when it doesn't you're left with &#34;Your babyphone is unavailable at the moment.&#34; on the desktop or &#34;Baby monitoring is disabled.&#34; on the iphone. and then that is that - no reason and no one to reach. Again, it mostly works and a reboot has so far taken care of the problems, but a hint as to what the problem is would be nice."
Baby,5.0,Love the Jumperoo!,We lived this product! Our daughter enjoys every minute that she plays in it. We would recommend this to anyone.
Baby,5.0,Handy,"This is just right.  Holds my cell phone, water bottle, keys, baby snacks, baby sippy cup.  Everything we need for our morning walk."
Baby,5.0,Using for my pet supplies!,Love this product.  Very durable and it even has a zipper compartment inside.  Lots of uses possible but I'm using it for my pet products to keep them from being scattered about.
Baby,5.0,I can see you while I'm working!,"I use this for checking on my MOm who has Alzheimers.  All her caretakers have Iphones or Ipads. We all check in on her via this monitor, even when another of us is taking care of her.  IT works great and gives great piece of mind. ;)"
Baby,4.0,added to the collection,"I have a few other lamaze toys and this one is one of her favorites. She loves the mirrored tail and chews on the tail constantly. We did however have to cut the ball off of it, she managed to hurt her eye swinging it around and I didn't want to chance her getting hurt again. Other than that we love it."
Baby,4.0,Too bulky,Bigger and heavier than I thought . Music is pleasant and sound too. However it was not exactly what I expected
Baby,5.0,The baby likes it!,My grandson enjoys his F-P jumperoo. He smiles alot when playing in the jumperoo. This gives his Dad and Mom some hands off time.
Baby,5.0,My son loves this thing,"My son is 6 1/2 months and we started using this at about 5 1/2 months. The first few times I put him in it, he just dangled there sort of confused and we had to put a thick blanket under his feet so he could reach the ground. But once he caught on that he could jump up and down, he LOVED it. He loves all the little toys and wheels and things to grab at, and we can put him in this to jump for easily 20+ minutes at a time (obviously supervised, but still let's you fold laundry or do other chores within sight). I don't know how long he will love this, but if he enjoys it another month or two, I think we got our money's worth."
Baby,5.0,Fits NATURAL bottles,"I think these may be compatible with both Natural and Classic - but either way, they fit nicely into the Natural Bottle Screw Rings. Disclaimer: baby isn't here yet, I will try to update once I have actually had a chance to use them. This review is based only on checking to make sure they snapped into place on the Natural bottle rings."
Baby,5.0,Great Product,Bought this after reading reviews of other jumpers.  the product is all that it says it is.  Put our 5 month old in it and her face lit up.  She loves it.  Not hard to put to put together.  Sounds and lights keep her entertained.  No problems with the springs or any of the materials.  At first questioned the floppy bumblebee/butterfly thinking that it should be more rigid so that it sticks up.  However. this has proved to be one of her favorite things because she is able to grasped it and pull it to her.  so now I understand the theory behind that.  Great product
Baby,4.0,Full of useful features.,"PROs:<br />* Easy to setup<br />* Setup on multi devices and share password for remote viewing<br />* View remotely from website: [...] Newly Launched Service<br />* Very good iOS software<br />* Able to set tresholds for noise, temperature levels<br />* Wide angle lens for capturing more<br />* Good performance over wi-fi. 3G remote viewing performance is also sufficient.<br />* It has a nice carrying bag and you can take it with you wherever you want<br />* It can operate on its built-in battery, which lasts for 2 hrs.<br />* It switches to audio mode only and acts as an audio-monitor (gives better battery life)<br />* Built in wi-fi<br />* Built in bluetooth can be used within the same room without a router setup<br />* Very good design & material quality<br />* You can talk with your baby remotely (like push to talk), it has a built in soft light and color is adjustable to any color with its led technology,<br />* It has humidity and temperature sensors<br />* Very nicely attached to baby's basinet<br /><br />CONs:<br />* Uses wi-fi technology, not radio, so, the video has very little delay, but totally tolerable.<br />* It doesn't technically zoom in, but enlarge the picture it already has, but not a serious issue in daily usage."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for City Mini,"Works great on our City Mini stroller. Finally--somewhere to stash drinks, keys, and phones! Should have bought this a year ago."
Baby,4.0,Good Product for the money,For the price this can not be beat! We use this on a baby jogger city mini. There  is only two very small issues for me. One- I would like the zipper pocket to be larger and on the outside of the bin. Second- This does not stay where I place it on the handles. This slides down when not in use. These are not major issues but little things that bug me. Even with that it was worth it to save the money vs the baby jogger organizer.
Baby,4.0,Fair,Sometimes the equipment freeze.. But nothing that can not be solved turbina of and on again. I have tried to link usina other computers using the ip but couldn't.. Working just on Apple computers
Baby,5.0,Excellent,Very good product easy to set up. It all I expect it. I recommend to buy this monitor is wonderful
Baby,3.0,Cute but not very practical,"We used this wipes case for a couple of months after our son was born. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work very well for us. Wipes dry out easily, it doesn't fit many at a time, and it is much more cumbersome than I expected and takes up more space than a bag of wipes.<br />We just stick with a \\""refill\\"" bag these days as it is more effective."
Baby,1.0,ZERO STARS!!!,This product is TERRIBLE!  We had issues from day one!  The monitor would stop working through the night and after all the &#34;online help&#34; nothing changed. We even went so far as to get a &#34;booster&#34; for the internet in hopes that would somehow make a difference and it didn't.<br /><br />Also their customer service is TERRIBLE!!! They only have online support that is ridiculously slow to respond. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I am now trying to get a refund and even though it falls within the manufacturer's warranty they are only offering a replacement or another one of their products (which has nothing to do with baby monitors)..  I had high hopes for this device and it was a TOTAL disappointment.
Baby,5.0,Works well for what it is!,"I have a Peg Perego stroller, and this stroller organizer works perfectly. The straps are made out of velcro, so it is very adjustable. I find it very useful and very affordable. Can't complain."
Baby,5.0,adorable,"this is the perfect pacifier holder ever designed, I was recommend them for any parent of a newborn to buy and use them. cute too"
Baby,4.0,Wrong composers...,"I love this mobile. My son loves to watch it and listen to the music which helps mommy get things done, and also helps him get back to sleep in the middle of the night. My only complaint is that all the composers are wrong. The Bach button plays Beethoven, the Mozart button plays Bach and the Beethoven plays Mozart."
Baby,5.0,Great addition for infants,"My son loves this jumperoo.  At 3 months, he had a hard time reaching the ground, but we placed the lid to a paper carton underneath and he finds great joy in bouncing to create light and sound.  It won't be long before we can remove this and he can bounce on the floor.  As he grows there are two additional settings to adjust to for his height (3 total).  Assembly was fast and easy.  I do find that the base is a little flimsy when moving around the room, but it doesn't seem to affect the function of the product, so I did not grade negatively for this.  I have found that my son now prefers to be in an upright position and we are able to use reclined toys like swings and bouncers less.  This gives him the support he needs while he is working on sitting upright on his own."
Baby,5.0,Great for toddlers,"We were given the AngelCare monitor when our oldest was born. It was the perfect monitor for newborn and infant, as the motion sensor pad and temperature readings allowed us to sleep well knowing baby was okay. We are expecting number 2 and have been looking for a good replacement monitor for our now almost two year old. The video resolution is great  and detail is perfect even though we have the monitor across the room from his bed. It was extremely easy to set up on our wireless and multiple devices. The sound is great - almost too sensitive if the volume on your device is up too high. All functions seem to be intuitive. Camera moves easily with a touch of the screen. Very satisfied and will likely purchase another one (or two) for our playroom and other areas of the house so I can peek in throughout the day."
Baby,5.0,Lamaze does it again,"Adorable toy with lots of attractions for the little ones.  Soft touches, crinkly noises and tabs galore make up this cute unique toy."
Baby,5.0,great monitor,my brother got this for his new born baby and he loes so much he can see his baby when he is at work and he said he can here him
Baby,5.0,Great pacifiers!,"I wish I knew about these with my first child! These are great!! No more pacifiers falling under tables or the couch. My son can find it, grab it and put it in his mouth all on his own. Also more of a comfort than just a regular pacifier since he can hold it. Love all the animal options. We have 2!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect Baby Mobile,"Nice colors, bright but not gaudy. Bought it as a gift for my new grandson.  Would buy as a gift for anyone with a baby."
Baby,5.0,Awesome product,Although it takes gigantic batteries my son loves this mobile. I like how the leaves move up and down with the motion of the mobile. Only problem is that the volume only has two settings and the low is very quiet and hard to hear.
Baby,4.0,Hours of entertainment,"Our daughter loves her Jumperoo and she's not yet 5 months old.  She's much bigger than the average baby at 19 lbs, but I think any baby at least 25&#34; long would do just fine on the lowest setting.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because my daughter likes the Jumperoo Go Wind more than the Rainforest."
Baby,4.0,"good camera, nice features","I like the camera good sleek design, set up was easy on our iphones.  App is OK, alerts could use some work, as they seem to be highly sensitive even at setting &#34;1&#34;. Sound cuts in a out - but thats a app thing not the camera, so I can't fault the product- just the software. Night vison works great.<br />No issues with camera at all.<br /><br />Works perfect on Wifi, Took a bit to get through my firewall (netgear Prosafe Firewall) and Cisco Router, but once I was able to allow the proper rules to allow it through I could access no problem on my iphone on 3G, other wifi networks, or from my Office Computer to spy on the wife and kid ;)"
Baby,5.0,Nice Product,Fits my baby jogger city select stroller great. Great price point. You can fold the stroller with the organizer on the handlebars.
Baby,5.0,"Fun, Colorful Bouncer perfect for busy babies!","Easy assembly, lightweight, easy to move around the house or up/down stairs.  Bright colors are fun for keeping baby's attention and lots of little wheels to spin, rainforest sounds, and hanging toys.  The seat is washable (I don't dry it though) and it spins all the way around so baby has variety of little play areas."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Bought this for my son and his wife. Works great! We all have it linked to our devices allows quit time sleeps.
Baby,5.0,Worth every penny!,Provides clear audio & video. Control music & light conveniently through withbaby app on your smart phone. Only flaw is that there is a few seconds delay on audio & video.
Baby,5.0,Great pacifiers,"My 9 month old sleeps with one Wubbanub in her mouth, and one in each hand. I keep a stash of them in my car so I can easily pop a new one back over to her when she chucks it out of her carseat. The monkey is my favorite because it's dark colored - makes it easy for her to see it on her white bed sheet in the middle of the night so she can pop it back in."
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Jumperoo,"I read all the reviews and was not sure I made the right decision for my grandson. It worked out perfectly and he enjoys playing with all the toys, looking around, and jumping."
Baby,1.0,Item missing from orders,"Order #103-7180037-2533839, I purchased a lot of items for my sisters new baby. I recently found out the wubbanub brown monkey, plush toy pacifier was left out, what can be done for this item to be sent or refunded to me. My sister and I live in different states so I just found out."
Baby,5.0,Diono stroller organizer,This is a great add on to any stroller that doesnt come with a cupholder or parent organizer which is a must for parents who like to have there phone drinks and keys in front of them :)
Baby,5.0,Great console for any stroller.,"Have used this with out bob revolution, britax b agile, city select. Has worked with each one and fits fine."
Baby,5.0,Love it,"This was my daughters favorite toy from 3 to 6 months. She loved it so much, I had to purchase a back up just in case."
Baby,5.0,Wow,My son loves this toy he can play with it for hours. Very colorful and it made for a happy baby and happy momma
Baby,5.0,Great Exercizer,"This jumperoo has really made my grandson happy.  He loves to jump and he loves all the little toys and gadgets on it.  He has choices, jump or play, and he laughs the whole time.  We put him in it for short periods of time during the day, and I love the expression on his face when we do."
Baby,4.0,cute monkey,It is great to have the monkey attached. I wish that there was a way to detach and reattach the pacifier.I am just sad that my little one doesn't want a pacifier.
Baby,5.0,A Very Nice Mobile,I bought this for my grandson.  He was very entertained.  The characters are colorful and the music is soothing.  I definitely would buy again.
Baby,3.0,Not very easy to put together...,"Not very easy to put together... There are many other mobiles out there that are better, require less assembly, are more visually stimulating... Stick with the baby Einstein mobile..."
Baby,5.0,Great for kids,I put my kids snack in this and they eat it in the stroller. It holds a lot and holds their drink in place!
Baby,4.0,Great additional storage,"We bought 2 of these, one for each side of our city mini double stroller. They fit well in the allotted space and provide some much needed organization.  You can fit a water bottle in each of the designated spot, perhaps a can of soda, but not a much bigger drink.  There isn't a ton of room but I am pleased with the purchase as a place to stick my keys, cell phone.  I would suggest this product to a friend."
Baby,4.0,Good product,I was very happy with the quality of the product.  My son loved to fall a sleep to this mobile.
Baby,5.0,Great for stroller...,"We use this for cell phone, keys, cups, bottles, snacks, pepper spray, and it works out very well.  Good size."
Baby,5.0,Definite buy love it. He hasn't discovered the toys on there yet just the ones in front but he loves them,This is the best toy my kid jumps around and watches the bird and frog with delight. Love love love it
Baby,5.0,Love this Jumperoo!,"My son has had it since he was 3 months & is now 5 months and he loves it and can stay in it for a while till I take him out. Great for exercise and motor skills, he has never gotten board with it. This was one of my best purchases, Very happy  with this item"
Baby,5.0,"Need more STARS....LOVE, LOVE IT!!","I carefully considered the options. I went back and forth between brands. Will I choose the right one?Will she like it? Will it sit unused?? I narrowed it down to Fisher-Price. Then the choice was which one. I went back and forth, back and forth...oh, you don't know. THIS was a BIG deal. I read the reviews. I re-read the reviews.  I finally decided on the Rainforest Jumperoo.  It arrived.  Her mom unpacked it. She watched intently.  She was placed in it. Not sure what to think. She looked left. Then right. Then left. The bouncing began. It continued for 20 minutes! The butterfly was mauled and drooled on. Nothing was safe! YES....SWOOSH....SCORED!!  Nothing but net!!  I did great.  She loves it.  The sounds, the spins, the adventures.  Gramme gets an A+.  Two days ago, she played for 45 minutes bouncing up and down. When she finished.....she stopped and tilted her head to one side and fell asleep. Now, that is a great toy!"
Baby,5.0,fantastic and...,"adds to the overall cuteness of my child. Better still, it works really well, holds a near perfect zero rejection rate and therefor become the &#34;go to&#34; pacifier for this family. We now own two, I guess that says it all!"
Baby,5.0,My baby's favorite!,"Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total."
Baby,5.0,Amazing,"I was told that babies need bright colors to stimulate them, though the mobile that I got my baby for her crib was very pretty she did not pay any attention to it. When I put this mobile on her crib (assembly was very easy), she noticed it right away. When I first brought her in to look at it she was crying, I put her down in the crib, turned the mobile on, and within a minute or two she was totally calm and watching the mobile amazed. Five minutes later she was making all sorts of cooing sounds at it. I got this mobile when she was only 10 weeks. Now at 13 weeks I can put her down in the crib turn on the mobile and have 15 minutes to do whatever I need since she is very entertained. I will be sad when she is too big for it, she loves it so much, I even enjoy watching it, and the music and jungle sounds are very soothing. Overall one of the best purchases I have made for the baby to date."
Baby,5.0,Good,"Good price, respond on my expectation, easy to get it, easy to use, I recommend is a good product. Thanks"
Baby,5.0,"great mobile, not sure if it was new","My son fell in love with this mobile! It keeps his attention long enough to get some short jobs done around the house. I don't have any complaints about the product. I thought I was ordering a new item, but there was some dust and dirt in the crevices that suggested it wasn't new. I would have returned it, but I haven't seen it in any local stores. I cleaned it and used it. I will be hesitant to order any other baby toys from amazon."
Baby,5.0,Love Wubbanubs,We have several Wubbas at our house and they're a huge hit with our 5 month old. He can play with it and grab it all on his own. It also works great for soothing him.
Baby,5.0,Better than all others!,"We bought Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for our main residence. Our baby girl just loved it from the start! She began using it when she was just 3,5 month old and couldn't even sit up on her own yet, so we put a little blanket behind her back so she could feet snug). As her feet couldn't reach the floor yet we put a few big books on the floor underneath. All this worked out just great!! Now that she is 6 month old she doesn't need blanket or books any more. She really loves her jumper and is fascinated by it's vibrant and cheery colors and toys!<br /><br />For our second home we purchased Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper (just wanted to try another jumper for a change). It was a little disappointing to us. Our girl still can not sit in it comfortably even at 6 months. The seat is very wide and shallow and there is nothing I can do to make my baby comfortable. Also the holes for legs are positioned very weird - they are located more toward the front of the seat rather than the middle and it makes my baby tilt forward way too much. She loves the toys on this jumper, but I can tell that she can't reach them very well because of the seat position. She can stay in the jumper for a maximum of 5 minutes and then wants to get out.<br /><br />She can stay in the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for at least 20 min and always has a blast! It's a joy to watch her jump in it! I would definitely recommend this one for your baby! you will not regret:)"
Baby,1.0,Crappy!  Don't buy!,"The wipes case doesn't shut properly, so the wipes dry out.  So tired of being up to my elbows in baby poo with nothing but dried out wipes.  Shame on you skip hop, you owe me an apology.  This is going to be recycled.  Hopefully in to something useful."
Baby,4.0,Terrific!  Britax B-Ready,"I use this with my Britax B-Ready stroller and it's perfect.  Light drinks may not stay completely level if they're not heavy enough but I've never spilled anything.  Easy to leave on when folding the stroller up.  Holds everything from your phone, keys, small things you're buying in a store, etc.  Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,Fun for Baby,I loved these rattles.  It was fun to attach them to our granddaughters wrists and watch her look at them.<br />I highly recommend them.
Baby,4.0,its tiny compared to the pictures,when the pacifier came in i thought the monkey would be a little bigger. the monkey on this thing is small....all in all it will go perfect with my monkey based basket for my friends baby shower...i gave the four stars because i was very disappointed in the size of the plush.
Baby,5.0,Over expectation,"Very nice myself  and my wife are enjoying the use of the products , i can see my baby at any time."
Baby,5.0,Fisher-Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile,My son & daughter both loooooooooooved this. and the remote control was a godsend. Very happy to rate this. Excellent
Baby,1.0,Frustrating,"This carrier does not stay closed, so my wipes typically dry out within 2 days of refilling. Knowing that they dry out, I limit how much I put in causing me frequently to run out. The real kicker is that this holder is really bulky and is designed to hold several wipes. Don't waste your time."
Baby,3.0,DEALING WITH AMAZON - NOT the product,"I want to be clear that this isn't about the product but the way Amazon dealt with my problem. I just became a great grandmother.  I, from the reviews, decided to send this item.  Unfortunately it was sold out.  The web site advised me to ORDER NOW and they would ship it when available.  So I put it into my cart noticing that the item had jumped from $85 to $99.99. In looking at it I noticed that is was from a different company and was available. I didn't want to pay the extra cost. I took the time to speak to an Amazon representative and she advised me that you cannot hold an item.  What confused me was Amazon told me to order ASAP and it would be sent when it came in.  This was totally incorrect.<br /><br />I am saddened that Amazon is becoming  sloppy on their web site.  They couldn't tell me when the item would come in.  Obviously Amazon wants me to buy the more expensive one.  Yup I am angry but I wanted to share this with other customers that purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />In addition while I have your attention I have learned that Amazon now charges a re-stocking FEE in addition to the return postage.  I sent two items back.  One was defective and one because I didn't like.  I expected to pay the postage for the one I didn't like.  I got hit with a re-stocking fee for the defective and other item.  So anyone reading this, be very careful in your returns. Call them first to get them to tell you what will happen, the return charges and then have them follow up with an email to confirm what they said.<br /><br />I never did get the product and had to order a different type. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years.  These last few months have been very discouraging as I feel Amazon isn't taking care of customers as they used to."
Baby,5.0,Sir Prance A Lot,This toy is amazing!!!  My grandson loved it the minute he saw it.  The bright colors and large size are great for little hands.  I would buy more from this company!!!
Baby,5.0,Great item,My grandson has so many of these he loves his little stuffed animals with the pacifiers. I think he has just about everyone that has been made.
Baby,5.0,My great grandchildren love the Rainforest Jumperoo!,"I purchased the Rainforest Jumperoo in 2012 for my first great grandson.  He loved it!  This year, I have a new great grandson so I bought one for him.  He loves it even more!!!  He's only five months old but he will jump for almost an hour in it if his mother lets him.  He's fascinated with the lights and music and already uses his hands to turn some of the rattle toys.  This jumperoo is easy to put together and folds for storage.  I researched these things to death before I bought this one and I think I made the best choice."
Baby,5.0,Mother of 3 recommends this!!,"Omg, I don't know how I lived without the Diono Buddy Stroller Organizer. It's compact, yet fits all my necessities, so I don't need to carry a purse on a quick grocery run anymore. When I collapse my Graco stroller, I don't have to remove it, it stays right on. It's a simple design and not to mention affordable."
Baby,5.0,My boy loves it!!!,"OMG!!! What can I say about this product. My 5 month old little boy loved his Jumperoo the minute we put him in it. He spins around, jumps, plays with the toys and laughs at the sounds it makes. It is great exercise and I can see it strengthening his little legs too. He is very rough and puts this product to the test. It is made very well yet it comes apart easily to put in the car when he goes somewhere for a visit. Great item for any baby."
Baby,5.0,Avent Natural,"This item works with the Avent Natural line. Be wary of other items, especially those posted pictures without the packing, as that makes it easier to tell what you're getting. There is another similar item, but those are for the Classic line."
Baby,5.0,Love this jumper,The jumperoo is much more bouncy than other jumpers we have used. My baby loves it! It's also got enough to keep her entertained while I do house work or cooking dinner. Very pleased with our purchase
Baby,1.0,Terrible customer service and the product does not meet even ...,"Terrible customer service and the product does not meet even half of what it promises, please do not buy this product"
Baby,5.0,3 month old likes it,I needed this for my 3 month old that didn't want to sit in her reclined chair any more. She wasn't ready for the bumbo yet needed to be sitting up. Its a mix between the hanging jumperoo and exercaucer. Easy to put together.
Baby,2.0,Idea is better than the execution,"Like allot of others on here, I really wanted to like it.<br /><br />First one we received would never connect with our WIFI home network. Emailed the Withings customer support and except for an email asking how my support experience was, I never heard back from anyone.<br /><br />After about a week of troubleshooting decided it wasn't me or my network and returned it. Amazon was great - one click return and since I had originally used the overnight option, the return was the same - received it the next day. Without so much as a question about the one I was returning. Sweet. Boxed up the old one, used their return UPS label and off it went.<br /><br />New one finally worked as advertised. Connected via bluetooth, ran the setup, attached it to the WIFI and that was it. We were off.<br /><br />Worked great for the last 4 months.<br /><br />Now the USB Power port broke - detached from the motherboard without even touching it. Like the glue just broke.<br /><br />Since the last Withings support experience was non existent, I called Amazon to see if the HW Warranty could be done through them. They said no, it cant - but we will send you a replacement anyways. Do you want the old one back? Nope, just call the manufacturer and see if they want it but otherwise, have a nice day. Now that's customer service.<br /><br />So my review says Its ok, which is about all I can muster. Good idea, bad support, kind of weak manufacturing quality, but when it works, it does everything I need it to: IOS access, local and over the internet with good pic and sound quality.<br /><br />Amazon on the other hand has been great all the way through.<br /><br />NOTE: 10/28 - Received replacement in the mail today. Plugged it and connected via bluetooth, and noticed immediately that the lens is out of focus. Looks like the auto-focus isn't working. Its focused if your about two inches from the lens, but thats it. Also, the color is all washed out - everything is pink like there is something over the lense (there isn't) and totally burned/washed out in the contrast'y hot places (like where a bright light is).<br /><br />So it powers up and connects to wifi, but no focus and tinted. At this point, I'm calling it - It's a piece of junk. Dont buy it."
Baby,5.0,terrific toy!,My six month old loves this toy. She can bounce around and play with some of the toys already and will be able to grow into the rest of the things she cant reach yet.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,"Purchased this when my daughter was 3 months old. She was too little for it at that time. Now that she's 4 months old she loves it. She can't reach the ground yet, but we put something under her feet to help. She loves to jump!"
Baby,5.0,Cute and Entertaining,"Another couple I knew had this for their baby and loved it so when I needed to get a gift for another friend who was expecting I went with this Jumperoo. It's bright, cute and has plenty to keep baby entertained."
Baby,5.0,Great product for very little money,"I needed something soft to mount on my bikes sidecar.  This stroller organizer fit the bill for far less than most \\""specialty\\"" auto/motorcycle/RV products marketed to do this simple task."
Baby,2.0,Not worth it,Thought it's useful turned out to be useless!! And not worth it wipes dry inside and it doesn't lock well
Baby,3.0,"She likes it, but fingers can potentially get smashed","6 month old has had it for a month and enjoys it- can occupy herself up to an hour if she's in the mood.  Biggest concern is that she'll sway back and forth, smacking the plastic seat into the poles and she could really smash her fingers between them while doing so- I've padded the &#34;corners&#34; of the seat and will soon add foam padding to the poles too.  I'm know it was more intended for bouncing, but trying telling a baby that. The posts could stand to be more stable- I don't think it's dangerous but could cut down on the clattering.  The hinged bottom is pretty much useless- the seat doesn't fold up vertically so undoing it only gains you a few inches of space."
Baby,4.0,Works well,"I like that this organizer sits up so you can put drinks in it but it is a little hard to get them into the holders.  I love the open middle compartments and just toss my keys, cell phone, toys in there and it works much better than when I would just put them on top of the sun shade and then watch them go flying when my kids would open it."
Baby,5.0,Best jumper for jumping!,"My 3.5 month old son absolutely loves this jumper! The springs are so bouncy that he instantly caught on to what he was supposed to do. I can put him in this for 25+ min. at a time and he is fully entertained. My parents bought him the baby Einstein jumper for their house. It is not nearly as &#34;jumpy&#34; and my son gets bored faster. If you are deciding between the two, the fisherprice rain forest jumper is the way to go."
Baby,2.0,"Cute, but useless","I'm really not quite sure what the intended use of these are. They looked cute and I wanted my infant to be entertained with these, but it just didn't work out. My son barely noticed they were on his wrists. When he got a little older I tried these again, at about 6 months, when he did notice them, he quickly forgot about them and went about his business. They never fit his ankles at any point, these are pretty small. They are quite snug on his wrists. Now at eleven months, he tosses them around for a minute and moves on : )."
Baby,3.0,Not Bad Overall,"I must say that overall I really like this monitor as I am away from home for work and it allows me to see the nursery from anywhere with internet access.  This was my main reason for picking this monitor.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of feedback/echoing when the audio is turned on and your close to the unit, as well as, the colour is very bland(almost night vision) even in full light conditions, which is unfortunate.  But for the price and access I think it's worth it overall."
Baby,4.0,great,I got this for a baby for christmas so I hope the baby boy like it for a christmas present.
Baby,5.0,life saver!  buy this toy!,"our little guy has loved this toy from 3 months on!  just plop him in and he can play with fun colors with his hands, grab at the hanging birds, and bounce when his legs get long enough to touch the ground...best toy he's gotten and we'd recommend it to anyone even though it's a bit pricey at around $100 bucks."
Baby,1.0,"My unit was defective, but even if it wasn't this is an extremely difficult device to configure","This product looks great on paper (or on the website), however the degree of difficulty is very high for a consumer device, especially one geared towards newborn parents, who are probably sleep deprived.<br /><br />It is labeled 'iBaby', implying that it is designed to work in the iPhone\iPad ecosystem, but it requires a Windows PC for setup?  Makes no sense from a design standpoint.<br /><br />I was in computer peripheral device support for several years and have a good understanding of IP networks, wireless access protocols, etc., and I could not get it to work.  In the end I discovered the wireless was non-functional, it would only stay connected via Ethernet cable, so I returned the unit.<br /><br />The product could be great, but the setup, documentation, and quality all need much improvement."
Baby,2.0,eh,"the items were fine, my children just were not interested in them much it was easier to just wait for them to find their feet on their own"
Baby,5.0,Easy & convenient,"Straps on super easy to my Britax b-agile. Love the little zipper pouch to keep a few things tucked in there: chapstick, gum..."
Baby,5.0,Great!,Ordered as a gift and was told that &#34;he loved it&#34; so I would say it's a great item for a child - he is 3mos old.
Baby,4.0,Very good part,We loved it because it is so handy and very easy to attach to the stroller. We strong recomend it
Baby,4.0,Nice,"Sturdy, cheap, and holds my cups well.  Looks funny on my City Mini GT double, though.  Much cheaper than buying the one made by baby jogger."
Baby,5.0,Love It!,"My 2 month old daughter constantly loses her pacis, the wubba has given her something to hang on to.... it's great for the trips where I can't put her paci back in for her over and over again."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,My little boy absolutely loves this jumper!!! He goes in it at least 3 times a day and it's as though he is trying it for the first time. The toys keep him jumping because they make noise/light up as he jumps. I would definitely recommend this to moms who are looking to keep their babies busy/happy while they return phone calls or simply relax and watch them jump.
Baby,4.0,Love,"My baby loved this toy. I got it when she was around 4 months and she is 8 months now and still uses it from time to time. She loves bouncing and all the attached toys (especially the dragonfly, she will chew on that all day!). This was a life saver some days when I needed a place to put the baby and keep her entertained while I prepared dinner, or went to the restroom etc. Now that my baby is standing and crawling, I don't use it as much. I put her in this while I shower if she's not napping, and keep it close to the bathroom door in our bedroom so I can see it from the shower. She still loves it, but is definitely starting to grow out of being entertained by it. I think she'll still be interested for another month or two and then she'll be done. A little pricey, but I think worth it, especially if you are buying it with the plans on using it for future children :)"
Baby,5.0,perfect price and function,"Don't buy the stroller brand organizer- that one is 4 times the price of this one- and this works perfectly with the baby jogger. very functional. You can't put too much in it or when the child gets out of the stroller it will tip, but good for small items like water and keys"
Baby,5.0,Works with our Uppababy Vista!,"I knew we would need a cup holder solution for our Uppababy Vista. Based on the price and the reviews I went with this Diono organizer. We are very happy with it and use it every time. We regularly throw our keys, cell phone, a pacifier, and burp cloth in there. And of course we use the cup holders if we have beverages. It could ideally be a little longer / wider for the Vista, but it's a multi-purpose organizer so the size was obviously designed for many different strollers."
Baby,5.0,Works the best,"I have bought 4 different monitors before this one. One just went dead after a few months, one halfway died (lost visual but had sound), and the last two had the worst reception ever. I was worried about the wifi reaching through our house because we already have issues with signal strength. No problem with this monitor at all. Pic is clear, sound is great, no lost signal, and I couldnt be more happy. Sucks I wasted all that time and money on the other ones but now I can relax.... ahhhhhhh"
Baby,5.0,Kids loves them,"Our kid loves them, we have the giraffe as well. It stays in his mouth and he rubs the feet and that calms him down as well."
Baby,5.0,Very pleased with this purchase,"My little grandson really enjoys the Jumperoo.  It's got all kinds of interesting noise makers that he plays with and the bouncing and jumping he does in the seat keeps the action going.  Add to that, the fact that the seat turns in a complete circle makes this activity center a very good buy."
Baby,5.0,Best binky,My 4 month baby love this binky! He loves to hold it. The only bad thing is you can't sterilized it.
Baby,5.0,Fun activity gym,This gym kept my grand child entertain and happy.  Fisher price always makes they products to high standards.  I highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,Best Bouncer EVER!!!!!!!!!,"First let me start by telling you the one and only complaint I had...<br />The instructions are TERRIBLE!!!!<br />Luckily the assembly is pretty straightforward and can be figured out with very little brain power.<br />I gave this product a 5 star rating as the pros far out weight the cons, this is the best toy I have ever brought, ever!<br />My son loves this thing, loves it so much he bounces until he falls asleep on it. Got several Facebook pics to prove it ;)<br />The bouncer is solidly built with materials of high quality, stitching on cloth is tight and really soft so you don't have to worry about your child being uncomfortable.<br />Our son has used this bouncer for over 3 months and its still in great condition, he loves the toy variation and the seat swivels so smoothly he has no issue turning to play with the next toy.<br />The bouncer also has a battery powered music and animal sound player which you will need a screwdriver for and 3 AA batteries. Its well worth it though as the animal sounds are triggered by moving one of the toys and it keeps our son constantly laughing.<br />All in all this is a great toy made of high quality materials and with a lot of thought put into installing toys with features and colors that a young boy would love and not get easily bored of.<br />btw if you like this toy also try the jungle gym of this same brand (Has a giraffe in one of the corners). They are both well worth the price."
Baby,5.0,monkey,"We booked a monkey on 1 October and received it in the mail in Moscow on October 29. Toy corresponds to the picture! My daughter is 1 year and she thinks it's nipple belongs monkey, so just playing with her."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for babies,"This mobile is good for babies of 3 month old or more. It works fine, It has automatic timer so after 15 minutes, you forgot to switch it off, it automatically turns off. It has remote to on/off. The only thing I missing is power cord, rather than batteries to operate.<br /><br />My baby cools off, once she see its moving.. so perfect for babies to calm, relax and play while sleeping in crib."
Baby,5.0,excelent,"THE PRODUCT IS EXCELENT,<br /> I LOVE IT .  IT´S BEUTIFUL , UTIL AND MY BABY LOVE IT TOO. MORE THANKS!"
Baby,5.0,Best jumperoo!!! Twins? You NEED two of these!!!,"I had exersaucers with my older two girls and I thought this jumperoo would be similar for my new little ones...I was way wrong!  This jumperoo is so cool...my twin girls choose it over every other jumperoo or exeraaucer they have tried.  Before I realized how much better the rainforest jumperoo was than other jumpers, I also bought the Evenflo ExerSaucer Jump and Learn Jumper, Jungle Quest from Costco but both of my twin babies last so much longer, jump so much higher, and have sooo much more fun in the rainforest jumperoo."
Baby,4.0,Good purchase,"I bought this for my newborn niece. It was easy to assemble, although it goes only on cribs with rails. If your crib/playpen has netting or fabric walls, you can't use this.<br /><br />Volume seemed a little low though. Otherwise it works well and amuses both adults and baby."
Baby,5.0,V handy and sensible organizer,"Very handy to store bottles, pacifier, cloths in it. Would've good if there is a cover over the middle portion...and if it could come in other colors as well. But nonetheless a great product"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for babies.,"Our 6mo baby girl loves her Lamaze dolls, they're the perfect size for her to handle and have all the features she enjoys: they have bright colors, bitable bits, and crinkle when she handles them, this one even has a little mirror on it's tail."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for babies.,"Our 6mo baby girl loves her Lamaze dolls, they're the perfect size for her to handle and have all the features she enjoys: they have bright colors, bitable bits, and crinkle when she handles them, got her a Dragon + Princes + Knight set and she loved them!"
Baby,1.0,"Withings misleading compatibility. Unless you have the newest gadgets, don't bother.","Wife and I were so excited to get this product. What a shame. Evidently we are &#34;old school&#34; and have slightly older Apple (1)  and Android (2) devices. The truth is this device does not work with any apple systems that cannot run IOS 6.0 or above. There are many that do not, including my wife's IPAD. Withings misleads you, stating in all product descriptions that it will work with the original IPAD.  Additionally, my android devices, a Samsung Galaxy (5 in) and Lenovo (7in) also could not support the software or upgrade to the versions required for the baby monitor. So, honestly, just a huge disappointment. I imagine if you are on the cutting edge of technology, you will have no issues, but if you are 1-4 years behind, you are better off looking for something else."
Baby,4.0,Don't know why everyone is complaining,"Ok so let me start by saying we have yet to have the baby this was purchased for. Out of the box, installation was a breeze, so I do not know what all the complaints were about it being difficult, it is literally 4 steps. I will say that the one thin that has kept me from going this a 5 star rating is that the unit does not have an independent power supply. If you have an old home like I do (built in 1894) outlets are few and far between so this will require some creative wiring to be in a position to see my son in his crib."
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Love it a lot. My husband and I run a lot with our 5 mth yr old and it holds everything needed for the run. Keys, phones, baby bottle and stuff toy for the run. A must have!!"
Baby,5.0,Very good.,"Makes me sleep happy, a very usefull item. Me and my wife love it, we use it all the time."
Baby,5.0,Great entainer for baby!!,"My great grandson loves this seat.  He is five months old, and can barely touch the floor to bounce.  However, when he gets going, he can really bounce.  He loves the music also, and keeps busy for a long time.  Great interest for baby.  I would recommend it highly."
Baby,5.0,great seal when storing milk in advent bottles,"Super affordable option to use with advent bottles for sealing breast milk for storage and freezing. great option when freezing. Easily interchangeable with nipples, seals tight and quickly thawed in fridge and ready to warm. i love that i didnt have to purchase several storage containers for pumping when my son was in nicu. no extra bulk in my cabinets!"
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Jumperoo by Fisher-Price,"My Granddaughter loves this jumperoo ! Very glad we bought this for my house,keeps her amused.<br /> Thanks well worth every penny."
Baby,5.0,great,my son loved this toy. He especially loved the rattle ball the dragon is holding. Unfortunately he ripped the ball from the dragon's hand. We kept the rattle ball around for several more months because he still played with it. Now my daughter plays with this toy.
Baby,5.0,Buy multiples,The baby is only a month old but this may become the official lovie.  I adore that it's a stuffed animal and a paci all in one.  You can hardly get more &#34;comfy&#34; than that (great transitional item).  I'm going to have to buy more of them!
Baby,5.0,Great product!!,"Easy set up!!  Works great on my IPod, IPad,  and my IPhone.  Buying the speakers and another camera to go with it!"
Baby,5.0,Totally worth it!,"My daughter loves it! We got it for her at 3 months old, and she started using it right away. Now she's an expert bouncer, after just a couple weeks. She keeps entertained, and I'm free to do housework (with her bouncing away in sight of course)."
Baby,3.0,Average Baby Wipes Case,"The red sliding button fell off after a week. The wipes don't come out as easily as I would've liked them too. However, I do like how you can fit a lot of wipes in this case. This way you can be sure you are sending enough wipes to the sitter everyday."
Baby,2.0,Not a tight seal.,The red slider does not seal and the wipes dry out. I had to duck tape it in place to make it functional.
Baby,5.0,Fits wide-mouted Klean Kanteens,"This works perfectly with our BOB SE Single stroller. More storage space than the BOB brand console, and much less expensive. Fits my two wide-mouthed insulated Klean Kanteen bottles perfectly, with extra room for my phone, tissues, keys, and more. Great buy!"
Baby,5.0,Sir Prance A Lot,The quality of this toy is incredible!  My grandson is 6 months old and loves it.  I would highly recommend this toy to all new parents.
Baby,1.0,App with iOS 7 is buggy and useless,"Well, after seeing two App bugs in the first 5 minutes of setting this up (had to hunt for the accept button - white text on white background; and cannot progress past the initial baby name, sex, and birthday - the next button does nothing), it is going back. If Withings cannot update the REQUIRED app for iOS 7 compatibility BEFORE the OS is being used, then this unit is not being kept. Imagine what will happen with subsequent OS updates. DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />This is not some kids toy. It is a $250 baby monitor that I would expect top of the line service with. Not a botched situation with \\""work arounds\\"" to function.<br /><br />RETURNED"
Baby,4.0,It's ok for the price,"Made in China.It's nice,but a little expensive.I bought it because the horse for my baby.A noise when shaking it,my baby may like that"
Baby,5.0,Fisher Price Rainforest vice Fisher Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"Awesome jumper!  We LOVE it!  :o)  We bought the Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo for our daughter and use at our house, which she loved.  However, we needed another jumper since my Mom was babysitting our son and wanted one of her own.  So after reading through reviews, we bought the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo.  Our son absolutely LOVES it and is the happest little guy in it.<br /><br />- We actually prefer the Rainforest Jumperoo over the Luv U Zoo because the toys seems to be lower to his level.  Not sure why but he seems to have an easier time playing with the Rainforest one.<br />- We like how the Rainforest Jumperoo has a round base as compared to the Luv U Zoo base because it takes up less room.<br />- We like how the Rainforest Jumperoo base pivots to be made smaller when not in use."
Baby,5.0,Stroller organizer will work on may styles.,"Served the purpose on my double BOB stroller. Holds drinks, phone and more. Can't beat it for the price. Very practical."
Baby,5.0,Our twins love this!,We started using this around maybe 5 months old and our twins are now maniacs in this thing at 7 months old.  We only have 1 jumperoo and the other twin stares longingly when the other baby is in it.  Great exercise for them for strengthening their legs.  They get so excited.  Safe for baby.  A must have!  We've tried a couple other at friends' houses and this one if by far their favorite.
Baby,5.0,I love it!,"This works great! Easy to install. Bought it for our new pup. She has some separation anxiety so we've been trying a few things to calm her when we leave. This lets me see her on my iPhone even when I'm not within range of our network. I love it. The clarity in low light is great. I haven't bought speakers, but that's my next step."
Baby,4.0,functional,"I like the more rubbery feeling ones, but these work. I try to not include feelings in the product, It lost a star because of the fact that putting the cap in is harder than the rubbery one.<br />Its a more firm plastic and washes really well."
Baby,5.0,"great toy, especially in the car","Kiddo loves it (6 mo old), well made. I think she will enjoy it for months more. Great to use in the car."
Baby,1.0,Don't Waste your Money,Does not seal all the way and my wipes dry out. The red slider does not slide very well either.
Baby,5.0,Wont get better than this,"Got this as the first tyoy for my baby....and it was the best purchase i had made (thius and the v tech crawl ball). My son is 16 months and berlieve it or not he still goes back to it. This toy has beedn part of hius growing up ... It went from starring at it in two months since it was hanging in his rocker chair, then he started punching it -- barely toyching at first with his sdmall hands; then he started pulling it ... Then he started pulling it so he can bite it ; then he started calling it A-guuuu :-)  now he bites it, chews it, smiles at it and throws it around like it has been shot out of cannon. And its still holding!!!!<br />I had to remove the little part where it has the plastic like handle cauyse he kept stucking his"
Baby,5.0,Best monitor ever!,"I love this monitor.  It is the perfect monitor for a mom like me who went back to work when her little one was only a month old.  I could watch him anytime of the day to see what he was doing and talk through the monitoring program.  When the room is dark it has night vision so you can still see your baby.  Best of all it is portable so when he goes off island to visit his grandparents I can still check up on him.  it has a nightlight, a lullaby song that can all be turned off and on from my iphone, ipad or computer. I paid big bucks but it was and still is all worth it to have access to my baby boy!  The live stream is only delayed by two seconds"
Baby,5.0,Excellent Training Tool!,"Sure, it's basically a hundred bucks for a bunch of painted plastic. However, my husband and I consider this toy an investment and the ticket to an early retirement as we are planning on our daughter funding our later years from her winnings in professional sports. Our six-month-old has been on a strict training regiment for the past two months of  three hours of jumping a day and we are confident that another few years of this will translate into millions of dollars in endorsements when she becomes an Olympic high jumper, or perhaps the youngest female to dunk a basketball. At the very least, she has developed some practical skills as she can now easily jump into her highchair. Five Stars. Boom."
Baby,5.0,Works great with Britax B Agile,Works great with my Britax B Agile stoller system. Very nice to carry cell phone and bottle of water or coffee cup. Much cheaper than the Britax one and works great.
Baby,2.0,Not Functional,"While I do like the fact that you can adapt the organizer to any stroller, it is not only very small, it's very flimsy and you cannot use the drink holders one-handed.  I have to hold the cup holder open and stabilize the whole unit to put the drink in.  And then it swings backwards and if the cup is full, it spills out the top.  I didn't recommend this to my friend who was waiting for me to receive mine before she ordered one for herself."
Baby,5.0,Gteat,Very good system. I used it to monitor my elderly ill mother. The motion feature assured she would not wander.
Baby,5.0,Great product!,My little boy loves this! he can just jump his little heart out. There are plenty of toys on it to keep his attention. Shipping was fast.
Baby,5.0,Hours of laughter and excitement,I purchased this for my 5 month old son and it was the best money spent. After many days of research and review reading as a father that wants the safest and most durable products. This has lived up to it. The joy and happiness my son gets from the jumper is well worth it. As per the parents that reviewed it as having a pinch point with the elephant it can be lightly pulled up and turned away from the side and it is no longer a issue. I recommend this jumper fully.
Baby,5.0,Great product.,Very easy to put together and my baby loves it so far.  Good quality and very sturdy.  I can't wait until he starts jumping on in.  A must buy if you are looking for a great product.  We bought the Exersaucer but will return it as the quality is very poor compared to the Jamperoo.
Baby,5.0,Love it,My son loves this. He has 3 different characters. I love this product also. It's a life saver at times when baby is cranky or hungry.
Baby,4.0,Good toy to keep a newborn interested.,"I have hung it on my son's play yard and he loves it. Probably he forgets that it is the same toy he has been playing since the last 2 months, but everyday he is exploring all its parts. Good to keep the baby interested. Only drawside is my baby's tiny hands gets stuck in the red plastic loop."
Baby,4.0,Decent,Works well- would be better if it closed over the top. Sometimes I would like to place my phone and wallet there and be able to close it. Like the cup holders.
Baby,5.0,Mall stoller storage without the bulk.,Attached to my Peg Perego Si stroller for some extra storage.  I like to have my cell phone and a drink with in reach while buzzing around town.  Fits nicely on the bars with the adjustable velcro straps.  The organizer is compact and foldable to stay out of the way when I fold the stroller for storage.  Nice to have some extra space without having to use my giant &#34;mall&#34; stroller all the time.
Baby,1.0,Not good for monitoring from outside the house..,The video can be viewed only from the same WIFI. It does not work via 3G or from another WIFI. Very disappointed :(
Baby,2.0,"Leaks, but I love the Avent system","I must be doing something wrong because it leaks. What is the point if it isn't air tight? I just use the regular bottle tops.  However, this is not a knock against the Avent system, these are my favorite bottles, the only ones to decrease spit-up!"
Baby,3.0,This is on ok wipe holder,This is on ok wipe holder. Probably a little fancier than it needs to be. We ended up using a more straight forward one the fits into our babies fold up change area.
Baby,5.0,Great value,It's less than $10. It's strong and hold different sizes of cups. Excellent value if compare with other major brand that may cost 2X more.
Baby,3.0,Pretty good monitor - some connectivity issues,"For the most part, this monitor is great. However, I have noticed a significant amount of down time... (connectivity issues) and we had to move it out of our baby's sight since the infrared light can be too disturbing in the middle of the night - hence we now can't really see her face.<br />We still use it and it has the potential of being great, but the connectivity issues are a real bummer."
Baby,5.0,Super useful pacifier...and fun!,"First time grandmother cannot give grandson anything but the best....and this is it.  He and his mom LOVE the Wubbanub because not only is it a quality pacifier, but Mr. Giraffe and Mr. Monkey keep it within easy reach of baby."
Baby,4.0,"good, convenienent aid.","pretty good.  holds on to &#62;almost&#60; any stroller.  anyone could figure out how to attach it.  two &#34;cup holders&#34;, one per side.  zipper pouch in center closest to you when you push the stroller.  empty center for holding things like cell phone or food.  glad i got it."
Baby,4.0,Great idea but needs to be more durable.,It was great while it lasted.  After a while one of the straps broke but was very useful for a little while.
Baby,5.0,Great!,Baby loves this thing. There is so much to do he wants to stay in it for over 30 minutes at a time. He loves it and it lets us eat dinner in peace.
Baby,5.0,Great for little hands!,My son loves this wubbanub! He plays with the tail and chews on its arms and feet. Plus he talks to him in his car seat all the time! Great product!!
Baby,5.0,We love it,My little one loves his wubbanub!<br />It was so perfect when he was an infant because you can lay the animal on their chest and the paci wont fall out of their mouth when they stop sucking like other pacis so you don't have to put it back in their mouth 10 times in the middle of the night.<br />Now that he older he carries it around and its hard to lose.
Baby,5.0,great product,This is great product . Worth for money . Having good quality plastic. I don't find any issue with red popup.
Baby,3.0,Functional but nothing special,"You get what you pay for here. I used it on my Britax stroller. It is cloth and hangs kind of awkwardly, but is functional. It is hard to fold the stroller up with it on. Luckily it is easy to remove."
Baby,5.0,LOVE,"Love these.  The animal provides a little weight so an infant doesn't spit it out.  Also, easy for them to find in the crib at night."
Baby,5.0,Works for the City Mini,This organizer fits the City Mini perfectly. The velcro straps are easily adjusted around the handle of the stroller and stays put even when the stroller is collapsed.
Baby,2.0,Stop working after 4 months; customer service is so so,Stopped functioning after four months.  Warranty support is so so.  They will replace unit once I pay to ship it back to them.  They emailed me a blank form to fill out.  I would have preferred they pay for shipping and the company filling in at least a portion of the form as I had given them all my data.
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"My baby loves this mobile.  Every night she falls asleep to it.  To be fair, she seems just as happy with the cheap wind up ones but if you have to listen to music thru the monitor until the baby falls asllep this one is far superior.  The automatic shut off lasts for a long time so there is no sneaking back in to turn it off or using the remote that comes with the mobile.  A big bonus since sneaking into the baby's room only works about half the time without waking her up.<br /><br />She has loved this since she was two months old and doesn't seem to ever get tired of it."
Baby,4.0,"Fantastic product, and works great.  There are just a few features that were MIA...","This camera is honestly great.  Setup was a breeze.  Simply watch the youtube video they have online and you wont have any trouble.  I really appreciate the fact that I can pull up the baby monitor from anywhere on my Iphone, Ipad, etc...  You dont have to be on the wifi to use it<br /><br />I only have two gripes about this product.<br />1) they dont yet have an iOS application for my MacBook.  Not the end of the world, but if you were intending on watching your baby sleep from you MacBook, you'll have to wait until they release new software.<br />2) You have to hook up external speakers if you want to be able to talk to your baby.  Again, not the end of the world, its just one more item that I would need to hook up and attach to the wall.  I personally will probably not use this feature, but I might buy an additional camera to use as a secturity camera.<br /><br />Otherwise, Its great!"
Baby,5.0,"great product, although some damage to the factory box.","This is a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas. I have done some research on line and this is rated the best. She is bouncy now when you hold her up and she is only 2 months old, she should love it. The package arrive quickly, although the box was shipped in its original factory box and the outside is beat up. Not enough damage to the box that I think the product is damaged, although I have not opened the box yet. Another family member ordered a high chair from Amazon which was also a Fisher Price and that showed up at the door in a separate box, absolutely no damage to the factory box. Over all, very happy with the price and the product."
Baby,5.0,Great jumperoo,Overall this is a great product. One of the safest and most entertaining jumperoos I could find. The only thing that kind of bothers me about it is music. I just wish that there was a bigger verity of it. It gets annoying fairly quickly.
Baby,5.0,A must for babies!,Love these things! I wish I would have known about these for my 1st child! I have used these for my youngest since she was born and she loves them. We havn't lost one and she can easily spot them in any room. I have bought them as baby shower gifts and people always ask when I got them.
Baby,5.0,Nice Mobile,"This is an awesome mobile. My baby loves it. The first one we purchased broke. But, Amazon's customer service responded very quickly and replaced it right away. The new one has been going strong for the past 8 months. Great buy! It lights up and plays different songs classical tunes or jungle noises. It even has a remote, so you can turn it off from a far and not wake the little one. And, this mobile was a replacement for a disappointing one we had bought previously."
Baby,5.0,Sooooo affordable and does the job.,Affordable and holds all the small items I need to take my baby for a walk. Perfect! I love it!
Baby,3.0,Cute but not reliable,"The product itself is very cute, it attaches to the crib well, and my son enjoys watching it.  Though, I have had it for less than a month and used it only 4 times and it is already broken.  The leaves do not go up and down and the animals do not spin all the time.  I have to reset it by turning it off and on a few times hoping it will catch and work properly.  The music is also soft and hard to hear.  I would only recommend this product if it was reliable and easy to hear."
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it,I got it for my baby when he was 4 months old. Now he is 7 months old and he just loves his jumperoo!!
Baby,5.0,Great exercise for the little ones,I bought this for the little one when he was about 6 months and he loved it the first time he got in it. Great way for babies to get some energy out if they are not crawling yet!
Baby,5.0,My son loves this toy,"My son loves this, he jumps for 30 minutes at a time in this. Perfect gift, he is 7 months old."
Baby,3.0,Does what it says but not primetime ready,"I have been using this product for almost 8 months. I like the idea but the product is not ready for primetime yet. It has about 8 to 25 second delay. This is not bad at all. It does however depends on Withings servers. So if the server is down you are SOL. It has happened to me once so far so I had to go buy a cheap voice only monitor from Target. Otherwise it is great product.<br />I like all of the features it has. The lullaby, night light with different colors and zoom. It all works as advertised. It does work from cellular data as well so if you are out for dinner and want to see if your baby was tucked in by the babysitter, you can!<br />Customer service however is terrible. No phone number, or atleast I have not found it yet. Only email. And they do not reply for at least a week. My monitor can no longer shutdown so it is on all the time. I sent in a request via their web help feature and it is been 6 days and there is no response.<br />In short the product is great. It does what it says, but should not use it unless you have a backup to monitor the baby."
Baby,3.0,Red wipes door slides open...,"I love the concept of a wipes case with a snap on strap, but the case is a little faulty. First, the case is a little bigger than I expected it to be, and its definitely a little on the heavy side, which is a plus really. I like that its heavy enough but not too heavy, it helps when you're pulling the wipes out of a nearly empty wipes case. I don't feel like i can strap it to a stroller or the outside of my diaper bag because its a little on the big side. What I don't like about the case is the red sliding wipes door. It is constantly sliding out of place and on more than one occasion I've had to use somewhat dry wipes. Its just a matter of making sure you place the case upside down on the diaper bag or completely flat.<br /><br />I would still buy this case before I buy a regular snap open and close case. I just love that it hold its own weight and the wipes come out easily."
Baby,5.0,Useful Accessory for stroller..,This IS a practical useful accessory for a stroller -- easy to install -- fits plenty of items.  Would definitely recommend.
Baby,4.0,"Life changing, but expenesive.",Life changing.  Seriously.  The binkie stays in my son's mouth and he's happy.<br /><br />The price is ridiculous so I bought a beanie baby for $3 and made my own by sewing a loop of velcro into it's mouth. Now I can switch out the binkie for cleaning of the animal AND the binkie.  If you don't mind paying the $$$ these are great and do the job.
Baby,5.0,It is the BEST EVER!,"My niece Nyla Rose LOVES this mobile. She is 2 1/1 months and is totally engaged laughing, babbling and following the flying animals! The music is soothing and she is content! We are both #WINNIG!"
Baby,2.0,Not for dry conditions,It is way to dry in Denver for this product to work. The wipes dry out in no time & you are left with a useless wipe & a dirty baby. If you live in a low humidity area forget this product & all wipe case products.
Baby,5.0,For the Playful Baby,"Man, they sure make cute things for babies these days! The baby of our acquaintance very much enjoys these Lamaze wrist rattle toys. To a baby, lots of things can be toys, including their funny, pudgy little bodies. Waving their arms around seems be all the fun with these accoutrement. Enjoy!"
Baby,5.0,A Wonderful Present to Give,"We were happy, happy, happy to find these adorable footsies to give as a gift to a coworker with a new baby. They were warmly received by mother and baby alike. Fun! They should make these for older adults as well so that we can find our feet a little better."
Baby,5.0,Works perfectly,"Works so well, I even bought another one for our second stroller. It holds water bottles and other necessities so that they are within easy reach. I like that the bottom is flat, so your water bottles don't swing around or hang at odd angles (like other stroller organizers that don't have a frame). Everything is easy to get in and out of it too. Very happy with my purchase."
Baby,5.0,Great purchase!!!,"This has been a GREAT mobile! I bought it over 4 years ago for my first and I used it for my second baby, let a friend borrow it for her baby and am now using it for my 3rd! The babies never seem to notice the light up picture but love the music and mobile part! My baby falls asleep to it all the time!"
Baby,5.0,my daughter loves it.,what can I say? my daughter loves it.<br />she likes the jumper and it has become her routing daily exercise now.
Baby,4.0,"won't regret it, good price.","good buy, good price.<br />Maybe if the middle compartment had a way to close via zipper - would be best - since my husband likes to leave his car keys and phone in there w/o telling me when we're out shopping, and then I usually go fold up the stroller and place in the trunk w/o knowing . Good way for his phone to fall out and break, or us to lose his car keys in the parking lot!  Lol."
Baby,5.0,Elephant hazard is easily fixed,"Bought this for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  We noticed the elephant was a little wound up too tight as it would snap at a very fast velocity.  The remedy was to let up on some of the tension by pulling up on the elephant and twisting it s few times to relieve some of the tension.  Problem solved and no longer a hazard, much to my niece's delight."
Baby,5.0,"Good case, holds a lot of wipes, keeps them wet, very durable.","I really like this case.  At first, I was disappointed that is was so large, but quickly learned that that's a good thing.  The button is not difficult at all, you just have to get that it's not a button you push down, but slide to the side.  The container has never fallen open, except when my daughter forced it open.  The wipes always stay wet, and I've had it for nearly two years, going strong."
Baby,4.0,does the job,My baby has lived this since 4 months when I got it. It is too tall so I stick a board game under his feet so he can touch the ground. The bug and lizard are great but the tiger and rainbow on the back side are really dumb and uninteresting. The tiger only pops up less than 1/2 inch. The seat does not swivel easily to the back but I don't care because the back toys are not that fun and the front toys keep him happy.
Baby,4.0,Small- but worth it.,My 4 month old loves this!!! I am thinking about getting another one just so that we can have a back up.
Baby,5.0,Love it,Great product. Our son no longer loses his paci in the middle of the night!! We are all sleeping a little better
Baby,5.0,a happy customer,I love this toy. It is bright and cute. Its for my grandson. The product was in perfect shape. It was delivered exactly when it said it would be.
Baby,5.0,"Great product, fair price...","Fits on my BOB great, very handy, does the job.  No need to spend more...this works fine, just make sure it's emptied before folding the stroller!"
Baby,5.0,"cheaper alternative, but just as good.  Might need to air it out","Very useful addition for stroller (we have a City Mini GT).  Same as a more expensive item (but obviously cheaper).  I did notice that it had a strong odor when we first got it, but it was fine after airing out for a few weeks (we bought this about a month before our daughter was born, so we weren't in a rush)."
Baby,5.0,Handy and cute,Worked wonderfully for keeping pacifier in baby's mouth while lying on back in swing. Probably would work well in car seat too.
Baby,5.0,WORTH IT,I already reviewed the giraffe but I simply cannot say enough good things about WubbaNub! My son loves to hold the animal and bite on the sides of the Soothie. I always know where his pacifiers are. Worth the $13 or whatever.
Baby,1.0,Is not air-tight by any means.,"No matter how fanatical I try to be with making sure it is securely tight, the wipes dry out within days. I found it was actually easier and cheaper to carry around the (overpriced) travel packs of baby wipes in the car with the adhesive strips used to close/seal."
Baby,5.0,"Baby loves it, smiles every time when in jamperoo","Our LO loves this and uses it every day. I wouldn't go over 20-25min at a time, as they get tired. Toys that are included are basic, but they still keep baby's attention. It was easy to assemble, doesn't take too much space and it is easy to clean. Make sure that baby is on toes when using the jamperoo, as if they are flat on feet they will get tired easy and the product is not meant to be used like that. There are 3 settings for height."
Baby,3.0,Continues disconnecting,"Some time it's disconnecting alone and I should , I have wifi and the machine disconnecting a lot and it's not from the wifi it's from the machine and I need to check it every time"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile.,"Great mobile. The kids loves it even after 3 years. Music is soft and good for bedtime and the rotating toys is fun for the babies, toddlers and kids. Recommended."
Baby,5.0,a must have,"Lots going on in this mobile, but I it's not over stimulating.  The moving palm fronds are an attractive feature as well as the natural sounds of nature."
Baby,5.0,I love it!,"It blends perfectly with my combi stroller. There is a zipper so I can hide my keys and phone. There are mini compartments for the kids' drinks, toys, snacks. I love it. The cost is fairly cheap. I am very happy with my purchase."
Baby,5.0,Buy Two! These are GREAT,I've given these to all my pregnant friends. Babies don't lose their pacifiers because they are holding onto the toy. Super durable. You need to order two so that when one is in the washing machine they have the other one!
Baby,5.0,Good little basket.  Works on Baby Jogger City Mini,Good little caddy for our BabyJogger.  please with the quality to price ratio.  The top edge has a wire running around it so it keeps its shape for the most part.
Baby,5.0,INCREDIBLE! Awesome!!,"Wow!! This was the greatest baby toy I ever bought. It works incredible. At the office, no worries I can see my baby. Across the country, no worries I can see my baby. AWESOME!!!!!"
Baby,1.0,Too easily opened,"This seemed like a wise purchase... however it does not stay shut when you put it in your diaper bag, allowing the wipes to dry out. Every time I pull it out of the bag the red cap seems to be open. Slides open way to easily. I do not recommend."
Baby,4.0,Good idea but....,"This was a good idea and I have used it by attaching it to my stroller, but I did not realize that it had fallen open and all of the wipes were dried out when I needed them.  I will definitely check it before I take the stroller out next time."
Baby,5.0,My grand baby loves this Jumperoo !,Purchased this for my 5 month old grandson. He loves to jump and play with all the activities. I would highly recommend this Jumperoo.
Baby,3.0,"Great ""Grow with me"" Jump toy!  Small foot print - sturdy - watch out for the elephant, potiental pinch hazard...","This jumper is great!<br />My son LOVES to jump and this is just what he needed.<br />The jumper is adjustable so you can adjust it for the age.  We have it set and just put a pillow under him so he bounces off of that.<br />My son is 6m old so the center area fits him very well.  he's big too - wears 9m+ clothes!<br /><br />This center has a lot of activities plus a little space to put small toys on.  I really like the back support and the sides as they're very soft.  He's not ready for a lot of the activities so we'll just have to see how he grows into them in the next few months.<br />He can't really manipulate anything around him yet, he picks up toys I put in front of him and trys to turn the clear balls but he's not ready for it yet.  The dangley butter fly is useless at this age since it just falls and for a 6m old &#34;out of site out of mind!&#34;<br />The elephant needs to be watched!  When it's turned make sure your child's fingers aren't there... it's a pinch hazard.  Why is this elephant backwards anyway!?<br /><br />I like that this jumper doesn't take up as much floor space (almost!) as a regular exersaucer.<br />So far we haven't added batteries too it since there's usually enough going on and new experiences.  Think we'll add batteries later!"
Baby,5.0,Seal the new natural bottle. Great to store breast milk or baby food.,"Fits perfect on the new natural bottles and niplles. Realy seals the bottle, does not matter the side you use it.<br />Great to store breast milk on the fridge, just were you are going to use it. Avoiding manipulation of the milk. Also great to transport the milk or tolher liquids.<br />And after, you can use it to store baby food."
Baby,5.0,Love the Wubbanub pacifiers,"We love the wubbanub pacifiers.  When my son falls asleep, I had to search his basinet for the regular pacifiers, but with the wubbanub, it is always on his chest or right beside him.  He's 2 months old now and he's starting to grab it and play with it. So, that kills two birds with one stone."
Baby,3.0,Recommend as a newborn gift,Cute design and activities but too small and not appropriate for babies who have started rolling and moving.  This should be recommended for 0-6 mos.
Baby,4.0,GREAT IDEA...TWO THUMBS UP!!!,"IT COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU HAVE A STROLLER WITH NO CUP HOLDER (IT'S ISOLATED WHICH IS A PLUS!!). AND IT ALSO HAS A SMALL ZIPPER POCKET GOOD FOR YOUR CELL PHONE, ID OR LOOSE CHANGE WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HANDBAG AT HOME FOR A QUICK OUTING. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS ORGANIZER IS YOU CAN REMOVE IT FROM YOUR STROLLER AT ANY TIME WHEN NOT IN USE."
Baby,4.0,Great product,Keeps the wipes moist and compact. Fits very well in our diaper bag. The only downside is it is a little on the heavy side.
Baby,3.0,"Good camera, HORRIBLE app","decent baby monitor, but definitely has some issues.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. easy set up<br />2. great connectivity over WIFI, never had an issue<br />3. Pan and Tilt work great<br />4. Audio is clear and loud... only a 2 sec. delay for me<br />5. decent resolution, zoom get blurry but thats expected<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. The app is horrible... some functions don't work at all<br />2. Snap a picture does not work, at all.<br />3. Notifications don't work well, too sensitive even with adjustments<br />4. Night vision is washed out with over contrast even when adjusted<br />5. Doesn't work on Android devices, even though they are &#34;working on it&#34;<br /><br />I am going to try to get a different baby monitor, this was the first one I bought and it does some things well but not enough to justify keeping it or recommending you buy one."
Baby,5.0,Serves purpose perfectly for a great price!,We are so happy with this purchase and cannot recommend it highly enough for parents needing a console on their child's stroller. We attached the Diono stroller organizer to our City Mini GT and it has not disappointed. The small zipper pouch on the inside is perfect for keys or ID and having two cup holders is great. It fits on our stroller very well and isn't bulky or difficult to access as others we researched. You won't be disapointed!
Baby,5.0,loved,This was so cute.  My daughter loved playing with this.  I would attach it to her carrier. It would be a great gift for a baby shower.
Baby,5.0,Work as intended. Allow me to continue to get use out of smaller Avent bottles.,"I bought these discs after my little one moved from the 4oz bottle to the 9oz bottles. They allow me to use the smaller bottles to store breast milk, formula and water. They work well on my Avent natural 4oz and 9oz. bottles and can be sterilized in microwave steam bags."
Baby,1.0,Useless,"This case looked good and worked well, at first. We kept it in the diaper bag. The problem was that the red slider button that you use to open it kept coming off. After a couple of weeks, it was lost and gone for good. I threw the case away, as it's open to the air without the red slider. I don't know how anybody with a baby or toddler around keeps track of the slider for this thing."
Baby,5.0,"Love, love, love it!!!!","I love it, the baby loves it.  This is the best investment I have ever bought for my kids!!  Better than all of the rest of the jumperoos, definitely."
Baby,5.0,Best Wipe Holder,"This is the best wipe holder I have ever bought, the closure is very sturdy and it holds a lot of wipes without being too  bulky"
Baby,5.0,Best overall device at twice the price.  About to buy a third!,"I use it as a burglar alarm for my condo a hundred miles from home.  For the freezing problem, I put a Xmas light timer on it and automatically power cycle twice a day. It hasn't froze since. I bet they have an undiagnosed memory leak.  The best features are enabled via the  I.E. browser.  Motion and sound alerts with snapshots go to my mobile email and FTP server.  If a robbery occurs, I automatically have two sets of pics off-site!  You can even trigger it with some smoke detectors.<br />The documentation to activate this stuff is really lacking, which accounts for most all the bad reviews.  Us fans should write something for them to encourage their sales and promote future innovation."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,I have this at my house for when grand babies visit. My 5 month old granddaughter loved it so much that we sent one Las Vegas for her.
Baby,1.0,DON'T PURCHASE THIS THING.,"I hate this thing!!!<br />The latch never stays on ANYTHING, the red dot FALLS OFF EVERYWHERE and since the latch always comes off the thing falls everywhere and THERE GO ALL MY WIPES cleaning some floor somewhere.<br />It's so NOT a good buy. It's clear that the reason it's so cheap is b/c it's CHEAP!"
Baby,5.0,Fits well and very handy,I have a City Mini stroller.  This fits nicely. I find it comes in quite handy. It's nice to have an extra place to put stuff!
Baby,5.0,A must-have for your stroller.,"Really convenient and stores a lot when we're out and about. My only complaint is the velcro straps, I would have preferred clips or something like that so it was easier to move around. We use it on our city mini and it works perfectly. Overall, a good buy."
Baby,5.0,"My boy loves it, proving my wife wrong for once! Success!!","This is one of my 7 month old child's favorite toys! My wife was like, &#34;he's not gonna like it&#34;, and I was like, &#34;you just watch&#34;. And voila! He loves it!... He especially likes &#34;eating&#34; the little white product-label for some reason, haha :-D"
Baby,5.0,Best baby product ever!,"I can't even start to describe how much my son loves this toy!  He uses it so many times a day to get all of that energy out!!  He was able to sit and play with the toys at 4 months, and he is 9 months now and still loves it.  Now he uses it for the jumping function.  Great quality product.  The toys are very entertaining to my son.  He can move around easy and the jumping springs allowed him to jump even at an early age.  He was a little short for it at the beginning, but we just put a pillow under him, and it worked fine."
Baby,5.0,Works for 2013 City Mini,"Works great for my 2013 City Mini, and much cheaper than the Baby Jogger brand alternatives!  It's fabric with a frame but keeps its shape fairly well.  The cup holders are elastic to keep water bottles and cups in place well."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!,Great! My daughter loves this. The pacifier is great and she also loves to hang onto the monkey. So cute!
Baby,5.0,Must have for new moms!,"This item was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it was very silly, now I don't know if we could live without it! I am ordering another one just in case this one gets lost. It helps keep the binky in my daughters mouth, but also she likes to stroke the arms and legs and seems to find it comforting. It also makes it much easier to find in the diaper bag without taking everything out of the bag in a mad search for a binky. I will buy one for every baby shower I go to from now on."
Baby,5.0,Perfect Gift!,My baby loved these! They were perfect for when he was little and they soothed him to sleep because of their design. I recommend!
Baby,5.0,Lifesaver,"My daughter absolutely loves this pacifier. She clutches the adorable stuffed monkey like it is a life saver, and believe me, it is!!!"
Baby,3.0,Fugly but hopefully will keep my son happy,Holy cow this thing is giant and kind of hideous looking.  That being said if it can keep my son entertained it's all worth it.  Right now he's 4 months old and seems to get mildly freaked out when I put him in.
Baby,5.0,Great toy great price,"This toy is a great price for what you are getting. It is good for home or on the go, has plenty of toys to grab my four month olds' interest and lots of dangling items to grab and chew. I am really pleased with the quality and function."
Baby,4.0,"Good quality, great price","Good product.  For the price, you really can't beat it.  I was tempted to order the Britax one to match our stroller, but just didn't want to pay for it.  Although I sometimes wish this one closed/covered and had bigger cup holders, I really can't complain about quality or overall functionality."
Baby,5.0,MONKEY WUBBANUB,THIS IS AN ADORABLE ITEM. BABY HOLDS IT ON ITS OWN. ITS A NATURAL. BABY LOVES IT. A MUST HAVE
Baby,5.0,These are a must and they make a great gift!,"Everyone should have these pacifiers!  They are perfect for babies who don't quite have a strong sucking grip and when they fall, they are easier to find (no rolling under the sofa!).  Throw in washing machine then rinse any soap residue off pacifier.  Very durable.  When my son was 1 year, I cut the paci off the mouth of the monkey and handed it to him when he went to bed...He started to put it in his mouth then realized the pacifier was gone then he just squeezed the monkey and laid down!  No more paci after that day and no issues!"
Baby,5.0,Lamaze Wrist Rattles,"I bought these as a gift and they were very happy with them.  I was told they keep her entertained for quite a while, they are light weight and easy to put on her tiny wrists!  Great product."
Baby,5.0,Fabulous find!!!,"This monitor was a replacement for a Motorola system which turned out to be a huge disappointment!!  Very shoddy.  Since my grand daughter is 3 years old, i didn't see the sense in investing in an entire system yet again, and ordered this as an option as you only need to purchase the monitor.  It has been a hugely pleasant surprise.  It pans the room and zooms in and can be seen from a number of devices which we already own.  It is phenomenal product and I am surprised that Apple doesn't make more of it.  Love it!"
Baby,4.0,Almost Five Stars,"I give the ibaby four and not five stars only because for some reason, I can't always connect to the camera when I'm out of the house, which was the whole point of buying the thing in the first place; I wanted to be able to spy from wherever I am.  I suppose it could be my wireless network but I have another older ibaby for my other child and don't have the same issue.  So my powers of deduction lead me to believe it's the camera."
Baby,3.0,Alright product,It keeps my baby entertained but it eats through batteries like crazy. The problem is that the light never shuts off even though the rest of the mobile does so it drains the battery over night if you turn it on.
Baby,5.0,Great gift.,Love it. Wish it had been around for my oldest son who loved his binkie. I'm buying them for all my prego friends.
Baby,5.0,Works with Avent natural bottles,Works with Avent natural bottles. I pump into my bottles and use these rings when storing or transporting the milk or putting the bottle in the freezer. I have never had any issues with leakage and would highly recommend these and the avent conversion kit for a pumping mom.
Baby,2.0,don't waste your $,"had many of these. cheaply made not durable.  the plastic case cracked, the red button which slides to close case (which was a good design idea in theory) slid off and the wipes wold dry out."
Baby,5.0,Love this jumparoo!,"Love this jumparoo! After reading reviews and deciding between this and another jumper, I went with this one and haven't looked back. The toys are engaging, the height adjustment is great and the assembly is simple. Shipping was quick (amazon prime is awesome!) I would definitely recommend this jumparoo to anyone interested in one for their little ones."
Baby,3.0,"Some pros, cons, and unexpected results!","I read the reviews and was nervous at first because I was not sure if they would fit my nephews' wrists and I did not know if they would rattle loud enough. When I received them, I was impressed that they not only easily fit both of my nephews' wrists (who are 2 and 3 months old), but they even fit my own! Of course, they just barely fit. There was some Velcro left over, which was slightly scratchy, so if for some reason a little was showing for the baby, I would have to keep that into consideration.<br /><br />The rattling, on the other hand, was not what I expected. One of them rattled, but it was considerably quiet. The other did not even rattle! It was the type of toy you squish and it makes crunching noises, which was actually probably more entertaining than the rattle. The babies did not seem to notice them yet, but they may be too young for that still.<br /><br />One other note, I remember reading a review that said their older child seemed more entertained by it than their baby. Boy was that the case in this scenario! My two year old nephew wanted to have them for himself! We had to bargain with him to let the baby have them. Even then, he'd soon be trying to grab them off the baby again! So, keep that in mind if there will be an older sibling in the house!"
Baby,5.0,LIFE SAVER!,"PROS:<br />If the paci falls it stays where it lands rather than bouncing off to God knows where.<br />You can keep the paci in his/her mouth in the car seat by sticking the monkey's arms under the seat belt straps.<br />This is the only paci we use--great for sleeping because the hands/feet have tiny beans in them that help keep the animal on the child's chest for sleeping (which keeps the paci in his/her mouth--unless you have an active sleeper).<br /><br />CON:<br />The paci doesn't detach from the animal--this is annoying because sometimes I would like to switch out the paci to another one if I don't have time to clean the paci.  (However, the fact that it doesn't detach is nice in the sense that it won't get lost)."
Baby,5.0,Love It!,"Colorful, musical, action mobile.  The figures face the baby instead of the colorful part facing upward toward the adults. Very pleased with the price."
Baby,4.0,Fits the CitiMini.,This product does the job for which it was purchased. It fits perfectly on my CitiMini and has held up just fine.
Baby,4.0,"Great, but Elephant needs to be fixed for little fingers.","Great jumperoo. Sturdy even for a very active and high jumping baby. Have used it for 3 months and still works like new. Only problem is the Blue Elephant: my son has gotten his fingers caught there a lot. However, we &#34;broke&#34; the elephant in a way that it now rotates completely instead of snapping back to it's original position, but it's still safely attached to the jumper."
Baby,5.0,Keeps the pacifier in while the baby is sleeping.,I love these things.  I have a few in different shapes for my little girl so there is always one in the car or crib.  The best thing about them is they allow you to prop it in their mouth to lower the chances of it falling out when they are sleeping.
Baby,5.0,The best!,"Works perfectly with my Uppababy.  Holds everything, including full coffee cups, and the bonus is that it tilts, so if I need to raise the front of the buggy to go over a step, for instance, the accessory buddy stays level and won't spill my drink or toss my keys and phone.  I really love this caddy."
Baby,5.0,"Great purchase, and glad we went with this cheaper option",This is great and glad I went with this one rather than the more expensive option. we have a Maclaren globetrotter umbrella stroller and it folds up fine with it (we don't have to take it off).
Baby,5.0,Excellent for the price,"For being such an inexpensive stroller accessory this works really well! It's nice and sturdy. I usually have my cell phone, water bottle, keys, and wallet in here and everything fits no problem. Bought a second one for my jogger."
Baby,5.0,The Peacemaker,"This is my daughter's favorite pacifier.  As an infant with limited motor control, the best part is that the animal body makes it more difficult for her to lose it or for it to fall out of her mouth."
Baby,1.0,"Poor picture and not reliable,","This seemed like a neat concept, but the product left a lot to be desired.  For one thing (the main thing for me), the night vision is TERRIBLE. I have the camera about 7 feet away from the crib, and while other monitors I've owned have not had a super clear nighttime picture at this range, with this camera I couldn't even tell there was a baby in the crib! One of the neat features of this device is that it tracks and can alert you to movement in the room; however, since you can't see the baby, this doesn't work either at night/in the dark. Since the only times I'm monitoring my daughter is when it's completely dark in the room, this was a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The other major issue is that it only ever stayed connected for 5-10 minutes. Then it would tell me that I'd lost connection and an attempt to reconnect failed. Sometimes I could go into the app and manually reconnect, but too often it wouldn't even let me. I can hear my daughter naturally from her room if she cries at night, so that's why this wasn't my main issue. If you are relying on this monitor to hear what's going on in your baby's room, that is a huge problem (I used this monitor for 5 nights and it never once stayed connected.).<br /><br />I also realized that I actually didn't like my monitor being on my phone. I like to make calls, answer emails, and do other things on my phone when my daughter is napping, and I didn't like having to sacrifice being able to see her. You can keep the app running in the background, but then it's only sound (so does no good if you are making a phone call), and whenever I did that it disconnected even quicker.  I have since purchased the Infant Optics DXR-8 and am loving it!"
Baby,1.0,"Terrible, confusing, convoluted","This is a horrible baby monitor. Setup is hard (had to try real hard to connect to the wi-fi signal from my bedroom which is less than 15-20 feet from the router). Did not catch the signal at all and I finally got fed up and returned the unit. Works fine if the LAN cable is connected to the baby monitor (but whats the point!)?<br /><br />The worst feature is that for one to view the picture on their iOS device, it has to be in the same WLAN network! Whats the point? if I'm in the office and want to see my baby at home, this isn't possible over 3G/4G/LTE.<br /><br />Went with Infant Optics which works like a charm (too bad there is no iOS app, however it does the same job for a fraction of the price)"
Baby,2.0,Used to be good then Withings 'updated' something and it's awful,"When we first got this it worked great. The app was reliable, I could leave it running at night and know that it wouldn't time out, or crash, or constantly lose the network, so if my kid woke up and needed something I'd wake up too. I was happy with it.<br /><br />For the last month or so, however, it's been terrible. It's constantly losing the network, throwing up a 'loading' animation and cutting out. It'll time out because it's always connecting over the phone data plan and not over our home network anymore. It doesn't matter what settings I pick.<br /><br />It's nearly useless, at this point, as a baby monitor. It's a great night light and soothing music player. I think you can find cheaper versions of those though. Maybe. Going out on a limb there.<br /><br />Whatever Withings changed it made things awful, not better."
Baby,5.0,Great jumpy seat,My five month old loves this. There is so much to keep his attention. It's easy to get him in and out. He loves to jump In it. It's nice that it has multiple heights.
Baby,5.0,I love this monkey - I'd buy it again!,"The Wubbanub Monkey is great!!! Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!! PRAISE the LORD for sleep!!!"
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub is great!,It was a gift for my great nephew (who is 4 mos. old) and I've heard he loves it.  Plus it's great that when he spits out the pacifier the monkey keeps it from falling on the floor (usually).  We HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
Baby,5.0,Sir Prance A Lot,I bought this toy when my grandson was less than a year old and he loved it. It is very colorful and well made.  Enough said.
Baby,4.0,great for monitoring from work/outside the home,"i like it; there must have been some improvements since some of these ratings came out. there is a tiny delay on the monitor (like 3 seconds or less), which may be more because of my wifi than the monitor. the only thing i find not super helpful is that the temperature gauge is a little off, and therefore i would think the humidity gauge is also off. not sure if it's my monitor or a problem with all monitors. we found it difficult to buy a room space heater because we couldn't tell which thermometer was wrong (turns out it's probably a little of both -- we tried fancy meteorology equipment [my husband is a meteorologist] and the actual temp was somewhere in the middle). however, i left this morning while my baby was upset and it was great coming to work, turning on the app, and hearing movement but no crying anymore. very useful!"
Baby,4.0,"Very cute, and handy to use, but practically no sound to attract attention.","They are very cute, but they don't make very much (hardly any) sounds to attract the attention of the baby."
Baby,5.0,5 month old Loves it!,My 5 month old loves jumping in this toy.  He gets bored after about 20 minutes but I believe that is most babies.  They need a change after a short time and this should not be used as your &#34;babysitter&#34; any way.  It gets difficult for them to be in this seat after a little while. Fun toy.
Baby,5.0,good infant toy,My baby loved these on her wrist.  She would try to put them in her mouth.  It was nice for her to have a toy before she even knew how to hold anything.  I also put them on the crib railing for something to look at.  The velcro sticks to the soft material underneath so the size is adjustable and does not snag/scratch other clothing.
Baby,3.0,OVERPRICED..  2 months of use,"OVERPRICED and doesn't last long..  I constantly regret buying this- my son used it from 5-7 months & loved it but now its just sitting there. He still fits but is too mobile to want to sit in it.<br /><br /> I only bought it because of the reviews, and as a new mother i wanted my son to have the &#34;best&#34; jumperoo.. a tough lesson as it resells for no more than $40 in my area.. Stick with a less expensive, this jumperoo is no better quality than the rest."
Baby,2.0,Easy installation.. Yeah right!,"I thought this was going to be easy to setup but it ended up taking my wife's older brother (who works at Harvard and is a computer wiz) to hook this up. When I attempted to set it up per the instructions it would only work if it was plugged in to the router. When I unplugged it and used it wirelessly it said there was no camera found. My brother in law told me this was a very complicated camera to set up and the instructions were absolute s***. After the camera was set up and you save your user name and password on the APP it works great, but if I ordered one again I would go Motorola."
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your time and money - Great idea not executed well,"This monitor has received a range of reviews, some positive, some negative. My husband and I wanted a monitor that didn't require a bunch of other hand-helds to carry around with us as we always have our smart phones or tablets handy. We figured that a lot of the issues were with less than tech-savvy individuals, and because we are pretty competent, we could make it work.  There were several problems with the monitor, making it unusable for us, and believe me, we tried.  First of all, the night vision on the monitor is grainy at best.  There is a significant lag in the video feed, even when plugged in via ethernet cable, and not relying on wifi, which incidentally made the feed even slower.  But the real difficulty is with the app.  It is very unstable for the android platform, and I have a brand new top-of-the-line android smart phone and tablets running the newest version of kitkat, so this shouldn't be a problem.  The app frequently freezes and disconnects, making monitoring the baby virtually impossible.  I also was never able to successfully set my monitor alert levels, because every attempt made the app crash.  Oh, and let's not forget the FAQ/tech support section of the Withings website which is a joke.  Attempts to contact the developers were met with unanswered emails. Ultimately, this is a great idea but it is just not there yet.  I have heard that iPhone users have less issues, as the iPhone app seems to be updated more frequently. Get it together, Withings!  You've lost a(nother) customer."
Baby,5.0,Works on the Uppababy Vista,We bought this for our Uppababy Vista and it fits great on it. I like the dual cup holder and the large middle section holds sippy cups or snacks. The Velcro straps are sturdy and work great on stroller.
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it hence I love it: ) Very entertaining,Pros: My baby loves it hence I love it :) Very entertaining. Lots of toys to look at. He likes chewing on the bug thing and spinning the frog ball thing. He jumps like CRAZY in this which has given him great leg strength at only 5 months so much so that he can almost stand up by himself.<br /><br />Cons: The hanging toys above aren't that engaging so they go ignored. The elephant toy on the front is really hard for a baby to turn around and seems like he could get his finger stuck behind it when trying.
Baby,1.0,Decent Product but ZERO support...NO PHONE# FOR COMPANY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!<br />We bought the Withings Smart Baby Monitor after returning a Motorola model that did not take advantage of Wi-fi. We were drawn to the product based on the features we saw at the Apple Store. We first started having connection issues which we troubleshooted by ourselves since their support never got back to us. We did not understand why our connection was better outside our home than in our home (as we never have connection problems when logging in from afar). We have yet to receive an answer from Withings. More recently, the device stopped connecting to our Wi-fi. We went through all troubleshooting tips online & after we emailed Withings 4 times we finally got a response with one other thing we could try otherwise they would facilitate an exchange as long as it was within the 1-year warranty. After trying & having no luck we reached back out to Withings only to have 2 weeks go by without a response. We bought the product much less than a year ago & provided them with our invoice showing that per thier request. I have emailed the company 7-8 times over a 3 week span with no response or instructions on an exchange. I now realize that they do not have a phone number on their website...probably for this reason. I have called numerous companies who sell this product & they do not have a phone number for this French company. Buyer beware! Terrible purchase experience!"
Baby,5.0,Amusement,"Good deal, good quality. My son use it a lot. He love to bounce. Easy to clean. Easy to move around."
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I need!,"This is exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for a drink, keys, phone, bottle, snack, etc.<br /><br />I purchased this for my Baby Jogger City Mini single. It's secure and sturdy!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"We purchased two, one for ourselves and one for my sister-in-law as a shower gift. We are really loving it! It is awesome that we can access the monitor from our iPhones or iPad. :)"
Baby,5.0,My little boy loves it!!,"We love the Wubbanubs! They are great for him to hold onto, which helps him keep them in his mouth!"
Baby,4.0,A great way to let baby get some exercise,Our 5 month old loves it. She tired herself out in a manner of 45 minutes. She has never slept so well.
Baby,5.0,Giraffe Sensory Toy,So cute and larger than I expected.  Our Granddaughter will love it when she finds it in her Christmas stocking!
Baby,5.0,Excellent product!,Extremely easy to set up after unpacking the unit and following the instructions which were well written and straight forward I had this camera up and running in 10 minutes the cameras ptz ability alows to see anywhere in our child's room and with the zoom it dosent lose clarity we tried a few different baby monitors but this is by far the best and will be used for our second child on the way<br />I highly recommend this!
Baby,5.0,Just what I needed for bugaboo,"I've got the bugaboo and have been frustrated that they don't make a convenient carry all/cup holder like my cheapie graco. I love this, it holds my phone, water, snacks, wallet, keys and more!!!"
Baby,5.0,great car ride toy,this is the second round of buying these. grandbaby number two. i think i may like these better than the kids
Baby,5.0,No need to keep comparing! Worth every cent!,"I would highly recommend this. My grandson LOVES this, and his parents think I'm the best grandma EVER! You won't regret it."
Baby,5.0,Great for storing bottles,Fits nicely with the bottles/caps with no leaking even after I accidentally dropped one.  Just make sure the seal is seated properly and there are no problems.
Baby,3.0,"Good  Idea,  but would not recommend.","IR  for night viewing  not sufficient for our use, otherwise  neat product.  Other pros,  appreciate the  temperature and humidity sensors,  additional  con  the app is a little cumbersome."
Baby,3.0,So-So...,Not overly impressive - overpriced in my opinion. I think you can find it cheaper at a store. I should have went shopping.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,Baby loves it...so do Mom and Dad! Highly recommend this item! Package arrived quickly and intact! Would order for others in the future. Thanks!
Baby,5.0,good good,my baby love this toy<br />This product is also nice and the feel is good design<br />my baby love this toy
Baby,5.0,Turned my baby girl into jumping machine!,"I bought this for my 5 month old girl. At first she didn't like to be in it too long, maybe five minutes. She would just stand on her tippy toes and not play with any of the attached toys.<br />But now she can't get enough. She stays in the jumperoo much longer, 30-45 mins, and just likes crazy.<br />Laughing, smiling and jumping.<br />Great toy to spend any excess engery a baby may have.<br /><br />Total recommend."
Baby,5.0,The Indispensable Monkey!,"Per a recommendation from early intervention for our premie son, we bought a Wubbanub. Their thinking was that the weight of the stuffed animal on the baby's chest might make him feel more comfortable -- especially since he was too young to lie on his stomach.<br /><br />Monkey has become the fourth member of our family. Our son took to him immediately and he really helped calm him down and go to sleep. Our son just turned one year old and he still loves Monkey, but is becoming less dependent on him.<br /><br />My one piece of advice, if your child loves his Wubbanub, buy a second one for backup. We lost Monkey one fateful day and we're all troubled until his replacement arrived."
Baby,1.0,"The Android app always crashes, and the developer won't respond.",The Android app for this crashes on a regular basis. I have lodged support requests on the developers site and have had no response. Without any support or improvement from Withings it is at best an expensive gimmick. At worst a waste of my money.
Baby,5.0,Great little toys,These are great little toys for baby. They fit chubby wrists wonderfully and the contrast is great at getting baby's attention.
Baby,5.0,mobile,Our baby loves it. The different sounds it makes is wonderful. She doesn't get bored with just one sound. Delivery was great
Baby,5.0,Fun for baby,"We have gotten a lot of use out of the Rainforest Jumperoo.  We have a different Fisher-Price model jumperoo at our home but the Rainforest Jumperoo is at Nana and Papa's house where we spend time at least a couple days a week.  It is currently in rotation with the third grandchild and has been a hit with all three!  My seven month old daughter absolutely loves this, and especially the winged bug toy that hangs off the side.  She is in the 95th percentile for height and weight and she is still at the lowest level.  She can reach the dangling toys and regularly babbles to them.  The quality is great- it has held up with three kids and being put in storage in between- and it is entertaining to baby.  I just bought another one as a gift."
Baby,3.0,Just ok,"My daughter  wasn't  too impressed with these.  They seem well made and stay on,  but she just didn't seem to love them on her."
Baby,1.0,doesn't work,it keeps flipping sideways so it can't hold anything. very impractical straps. they don't secure it tight enough to keep it upright.
Baby,4.0,"Jump, jump, JUMP!","We received this as a &#34;hammy down&#34; from our nephew.  He used it CONSTANTLY so we were worried it'd be worn out.  It was in great condition!  It keeps it's value!  Our daughter is 7.5 months old and enjoys jumping in it for about 10-15 minutes.  She likes the light up feature, the music, and grabbing at the birds hanging down.  It has three different heights, we just wish the &#34;shortest&#34; one was a little shorter.  We put her in it around 4-5 months old and had to fold a towel under it for two months because she was on her tippy toes.  She's in the 87% for height too!  Overall, it's a great jumper and we would definitely recommend it."
Baby,1.0,waste of money,There is not much to do for the baby. I should have bought the rainforest activity mat. Don't waste your money on this.
Baby,5.0,Must Have:),"This is great.  It's a really simple product that does the job.  I purchased 2 of these for each of our Baby Jogger City Mini GTs.  It is a very convenient place to put a sippy cup, toy, and of course....goldfish crackers:)  It kills me that alot of strollers don't include this (considering the cost of the freaking stroller).  But I love Diono brand and like this product!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable!,"Item came swiftly without any issues, it is currently wrapped as a present under the tree so I will update if any issues should arise. I got what I wanted from what I can tell so far! Keep in mind that every baby is different and will react differently, don't let others babies affect your opinion of buying. Just saying."
Baby,1.0,HOW on EARTH does this have so many good reviews?!,"This is a very expensive disappointment. I'm a bit shocked reading other reviews also, is my 4/5 month old the ONLY one that is super board and not finding this toy amusing whatsoever? The first time I plopped her in she was around 3 months, the good thing is it has a high back so it supported her nicely. The sad thing is, the toys are all kind of unreachable (she can barely touch the floor in this, however I did give her a little boost with a book to see if it would help) but the toys just plain stink. The elephant doesn't even face her, and to turn it requires more force than she has (it's hard for me). The music is annoying and there is basically 1 tune it plays. There is a little tiger that is supposed to &#34;pop&#34; up when you push the button, well he barely moves out...slightly does the tip of his head raise up. I want to know who designed this and if they still have a job, it's pathetic and obviously designed by someone who doesn't have a child. The only thing my baby liked was to look at the lion and she laughed a couple times but was over it pretty fast. There are a few wheel type things to spin, one just has colors on it, and the baby can't reach and she doesn't even care to look at it when I spin it. The butterfly attachment is shown in the picture standing straight up and it is not like that at all- it's this limp thing that unless she's holding it just lays on the bottom. Blah, waste of money, I try to get her to sit in it, but she just slumps there looking miserable and I take her out after maybe 10 minutes. I hardly believe this many people rated it so highly...makes me wonder how true these reviews are."
Baby,5.0,Hours of Fun,"We got this for my son when he was 4 months old. We put a big pillow under at the bottom and a blanket behind him to hold him in, and he started bouncing right away. He loved to jump around in this for at least a half an hour at a time. He giggled and smiled adn played with the attached activity creatures. He also liked to stare at the hanging frog and parrot, as well as chew on the bug. He enjoyed this until he was 10/11 months old and got into crawling. The lights and music options are nice and it is easy to clean. The bug doesn't stick straight up as it does in the picture but that was no bother. Easy to move, easy to fold up, just good all around."
Baby,3.0,Great product...when the app works...which isn't often!!,"This product brings me a lot of heartache mostly because I want to like it so much and yet they make it so hard to like! The camera works great...when you can access the app which is CONSTANTLY searching!! And the customer service for the company is horrible. They really could have cared less when I wrote to tell them what problems I have trying to get the camera to connect to the app and that it's a problem I have weekly. When the camera works, the picture is clear and I like that I can check in to see if my baby is sleeping even when I'm not home. But honestly, getting on to the camera is so unreliable and such a crap shoot that it makes it hard to recommend this product to anyone."
Baby,5.0,My child loves this!!!,I got it for him when he was a little over 3 months. I had to put a blanket under him to reach the floor. The first week he was kinda hesitant and did not know what it was or what it was used for. The first day he kinda fussed in it. The next day he did a little better. Then it got better from ther. With in a week he was having a blast. He can play in it for hours. He is now almost 5 months and will all of a sudden stop jumping and lock his legs and stand for a few seconds. He plays with the front toys mainly he has bairly touched the rainbow sun and tiger. But he does like the spinning thing with the lizaard in it. He loves the noises to. I have not changed the batteries yet but the time is coming. This buy was so worth it and everyone that sees him in it agrees.
Baby,5.0,Well built and easy to use.,This product feels pretty durable and seems to work well for what it is designed for. My wife and I have not had any trouble sliding it open and it holds enough wipes for a couple day trips.
Baby,3.0,Animal tugs the paci out,"My daughter has had a definite paci passion her whole life.  My son never used a paci but my daughter clearly wanted to suck on something that didn't produce milk.  When our fingers were pale and wrinkly from being sucked on, we decided to get a paci for her.  She was blissed out with the soothie (first one we tried) so we stuck with it.  I got her the wubbanub thinking it would be easier for her to hold it and insert it in her mouth herself.  Maybe the problem was that she was already 6 months old when we tried it, but she didn't like how it pulled out of her mouth and would get very frustrated.  She also seems to find the stuffy by her face really annoying.  We're sticking with a paci on a clip.  Maybe starting with an infant would make more sense, though I'm not sure what you'd do when the paci needed replacing and the baby was attached to the stuffy?"
Baby,5.0,What a lifesaver...,"Got this for our son when he was 3 months old. He cried instantly when we first put him in it. I think it was just foreign and loud and scared him. We kept him out of it that day, but tried again the next, and he immediately started playing with the rattle. We used this religiously from months 3 through 5.. every day, several times a day. Sometimes he would stay in it for 20 minutes at a time loving every minute, other times he could only stand to be in it for 5 or 10 minutes. Either way, it bought us some time throughout the day to keep him safely occupied while we got things done. Seat cover is washable. He played with every part of that jumperoo including the creatures dangling from above. Music isn't annoying for parents either (at least for us it wasn't) and there's 2 volume settings as well as a setting for constant music versus only when baby is actively moving. Once he started crawling around, he just didn't want to be in it anymore, which is understandable. So we have a gated play area for him now.  But for those early months, absolute lifesaver."
Baby,3.0,Got this for my 6 month old and it's okay,"This was okay to put together.  The fabric seat I got in my kit was inside-out so I had to do it and redo it several times before it was clear that what they sent from the factory didn't match what I had in hand.  Once I reversed out the fabric, it worked according to the instructions.  Other than that it was easy to put together and my baby girl likes it.  She is bottom 20% for size so her feet barely touch the ground on the shortest setting and she has to work pretty hard to reach the play items.  It will be better for her once she gets a little bigger."
Baby,5.0,Fast delivery,Fast delivery.  Very cute.  I am sure my grand daughter will love them.  Wish they had this kind of stuff when my kids were born.
Baby,5.0,Awesome Product! Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,I think this is the best product since the bungy jumper you would attach to your door frame but much safer.<br />My grandson loves the jumperoo - he giggles and has so much fun in it.<br />The product was easy to assemble so my grandson was able to have fun almost immediately.<br /><br />Thanks Fisher-Price
Baby,5.0,"Durable, one-hand use and keeps wipes moist","Best wipes case I've found- I like it so much that I purchase a second.  Estimate it holds about 40 wipes.  The red &#34;button&#34; does pop off occasionally when I open it very forcefully but it's easy to pop back on. My wipes are always moist inside and the plastic is sturdy enough that it doesn't pop open if squished in the bottom of my diaper bag.  The strap is handy and has a snap, so you can loop it  around your stroller, purse strap, etc.  Plan to keep using it to cart hand/face wipes around in my purse once we're out of diapers."
Baby,2.0,Not the greatest,"My sister in law gave this to us since her son got too big for it. At first, it worked fine and my son seemed interested in it. However, he seems to have lost interest in it. Also, the giraffe and tree don't want to stay upright anymore. They keep flopping over."
Baby,5.0,"Your baby will love this, again and again. Read this !","INTRODUCTION:<br /><br />This is a great product that our daughter absolutely love. Our relatives a different jumperoo and this one is way better. She first started using it at 4-5 months old and as she reaches different developmental mile stones, she starts noticing different things she can do with it and its like a new experience all over again. She has developed good strength in her legs and at 6.5 months she doesn't get excited about trying to crawl she just wants to be on her feet ! She is literally walking around as long as she is holding on to both of my hands or fingers (balance will take some time). I think this really gave her a great \\""jump start\\"", no pun intended, at her physical strength and ability to transition to her feet. Of coarse I am a man and I wasn't excited about buying it until my wife insisted that I get it and let our little one try it. My wife and I love it. Below I will describe the product and answer questions I imagine you would like to know.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY:<br />If your like me and your wondering what the heck your wife is gonna end up buying next which you will ultimately end up putting together, then your in luck. This wasn't too bad, the toys which come with this fit right into their spots, the ring which forms the base on the ground is easy to lock together into place. Careful attention to the instructions will need to be taken though. The one thing which I found the most difficult and I have to say the instructions were very poor about, is the way that the red cloth which forms the seat is attached, be careful not to put this on backwards. It took me probably 40 minutes to assemble, maybe a little more, mostly prolonged due to the confusion with the seat cloth. Maybe its just me but I imagine you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />HEIGHT:<br />So your probably wondering what height is appropriate and if this is the right size. If you look at the photo you will see that the base which the baby sits in hangs or suspends by 3 green straps. These straps are adjustable and have 3 main settings. What this means is that the straps have separate holes that can be used for changing the height. When our child was only 3 months old she was using level 1, because her toes were just barely touching the floor, and as we understood it thats how its supposed to work, you don't want their entire feet touching the floor or it won't stimulate their urge to press down and hop. It would be as if they were just standing. As she reached 5 months, she was taller and so we had to adjust to level 2 which she is still using now at 6 months and I imagine will last until 8 months by the looks of it. Then theres level three which we haven't had to use yet.<br /><br />TOYS:<br />The toys on this are interesting, and our daughter likes them. Some she didn't pay attention to until she developed a bit more, a mile stone thing i suppose. The toys as mentioned fit easily into place and their assembly is a no-brainer. The toys make noise, light up, and allow for alot of interaction and learning. The main toy which is toward the front has two switches used for turning it on and the mode, as well as the volume. One mode allows for the music and jungle sounds to come on only when she starts jumping. Our daughter figured this one out quickly and its great for stimulating her mind and body for learning. There are some other toys which she can reach for and spin with her hands. A leaf on each side above her have a toy suspending from above which are fun to reach for while she is jumping. My main disappointment  was the firefly like toy which in you will see in the photo appearing blue with black and white polka dots standing firmly upright held up by green stem. Well since we bought this, it was nothing more than a slumped over toy which leans toward the floor, and our daughter can't even see it. Im not sure how it appears to be standing straight up in the photos. Didn't come with batteries, but what I have put in there has lasted until now w/o any problems.<br /><br />SPACE OCCUPIED:<br />The diameter as per my measurement with measuring tape is approx. 33 inches. It will certainly take up some space however not a huge deal. I liken it to the space occupied by a desk chair. We keep it near a corner to use space a little better however not too close to a corner so that she can still interact and see her surroundings. If you block their vision by putting it somewhere isolated, believe me they will get so bored very quickly. The base of this has a folding feature which supposedly allows you to collapse it in such away that it can be stored however we have not used it yet as we use this regularly.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />In conclusion, this is the best purchase we made for our daughter so far. She uses it regularly and loves it. Its helped her in many ways. Despite some annoyances such as the seat cloth attachment during assembly and weird fire-fly toy which just sits limped over out of sight, this is really a great product. I still give it 5 stars because from my daughters perspective it seems like she would also give it 5 stars considering the way she spends time with it. I would like to note one thing, sure she spends up to half an hour jumping and excited which often frees your hands and allows you to get other things done, don't let this be something that is used for that purpose and results in negligence to your child. Your child will also catch on and start to cry when you take them to this because they will know that your planning to leave her there while your not there, they will catch on. Let these kinds of products be something that the child can enjoy while your with them, because thats whats exciting to them, that your there watching them jump and have fun. Believe me you will love the smile on their face.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to you, thanks and best wishes with your child !<br /><br />Georgetil now w/o any problems.<br /><br />SPACE OCCUPIED:<br />The diameter as per my measurement with measuring tape is approx. 33 inches.

Baby,5.0,Baby approved,My baby who just turned 5 months old loves this jumparoo. Glad I got this instead of the baby Einstein.
Baby,4.0,Great little toy,"this is great, I have it hooked on the play yard and it gets played with a lot. You can also attach it to a car seat."
Baby,5.0,Cool,The toy is very beautiful my baby is super in love with his horse saltarin really is very colorful and interactive
Baby,5.0,Perfect for infants!!,I attached this toy to my 4 month old sons car seat while we were walking through the store.  He talked to it and giggled at it for the whole trip.  Now he reaches out for it and snuggles with it.  We call it Dori and he thinks it is his best friend!
Baby,5.0,Interactive and fun for infants!,My 4 month old loves this toy.  It kept him completely amused for a 2 hour car ride.  He loves the different feel and sounds!
Baby,5.0,Bright Starts Start Your Senses,"This arrived before expected, as described.  It is really cute, but won't be able to say how the baby likes it since the baby won't be here until Jan."
Baby,1.0,"Battery spoiled, connection to smart phone instable",The battery didn't work from the very beginning. Connection to your Android or iPhone can take a really long time
Baby,5.0,Awesome purchase!,My son absolutely LOVES his little monkey! This is perfect and my son is 3 months old. Grandma actually ordered a back up for us for when we need to wash one or loss one!
Baby,4.0,Baby loves this,"My 6 month old daughter loves this jumper. It has strengthened her legs and she loves to jump to make it play music. We add stroller toys to the already hanging bird and tree frog so she can reach up and pull on them.<br /><br />The only cons I have are<br />1. the weight limit is rather low (but on par with other jumpers available)<br />2. the base is rather large and takes up floor space (not ideal when you don't have much room)<br /><br />It keeps her entertained long enough for me to make dinner or do a load of laundry, which is a blessing!"
Baby,5.0,Works very well!,"Me and my wife recently bought the iBaby M3 Baby Monitor. What can I say? It works perfectly with my iPhone, it was a easy setup process and now I no longer have to constantly worry about my newborn. I am so happy that my friends recommended me this product! It is a fantastic gift for new parents."
Baby,4.0,"works well, easy setup","Purchased this three days ago (12/20/2013) for our baby boy and it works well.<br /><br />Setup was easy - we were nervous because of some of the other reivews, but maybe things have changed for the better.  The disc contains both windows and mac installation software.  There are 2 long PDF's with ample documentation (albeit with poor but understandable English) and a quick start booklet that, if you follow it, will have you up and running in 5 minutes. You do have to read the booklet carefully, and I would warn you that setup is a lot easier if you understand simple networking.  If you can hook up your wireless router to your computer, you can set this up easily.<br /><br />Quality is fine, audio is just OK.  But, you're listening for crying, not 5.1 Dolby Digital surround!<br /><br />The video displays on both a web browser on a computer as well as on our i-Devices.  It would've been neat if you could AirPlay it but that doesn't seem to be supported."
Baby,3.0,not as expected,it's an ok toy but the description had me thinking it actually had music and did more than what it does
Baby,5.0,absolutely the greatest monitor out there,"I thoroughly searched and reviewed all available monitors out there and bought and tried a few others first due to the higher cost of this particular model.  They are absolutely easy to set up with either wifi or bluetooth, or both if you prefer, they are crisp clear in light or dark, and the app is easy to use on either your iPhone, iPad, Mac, PC or smart phone.  The account is secure x2 and when your done using it as a monitor, you can use it as a nanny cam, or home security system.  you can access the picture from inside the house or from half way around the world.  There is nothing else like this on the market, you can listen and/or watch continuously or set it for motion, you can also independently monitor the temperature, humidity and noise in your baby's room.  You can take a picture and also shhh your baby as the communication is two way."
Baby,5.0,so cute!,My daughter in law has a monkey them for the babies room and I couldn't believe I found this.  My granddaughter took to it right away.
Baby,5.0,fun,I can leave my nephew in here and have him be entertained while I cook and clean the house .
Baby,4.0,Wonderful jumper !,It is easy to assemble.  Adjusts easily in height as the child grows. Entertaining and  educational for children to build motor skills.
Baby,5.0,Grandson's favorite,"I purchased this jumperoo, because my grandson loved to play on the one at his day care. He loves to jump and hop and also play with the toys that are all around. This appears to be a safe toy that satisfies an infant's desire to work his muscles, as well as experiment with toys."
Baby,4.0,Works we'll.,Baby will pull it out of his mouth after awhile though.  I suppose that happens with any other brand.  On the upside it taught him to grab things.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,We have 2 of these and have not lost a pacifier yet. The best part is our 6 month old can find her pacifier and put it back in her mouth all by herself.
Baby,4.0,Not as weighted as I had thought,"The WubbaNub was recommended by a friend who witnessed our little one popping out his pacifier. I thought it would be weighted more, almost like a Beanie Baby, but it doesn't add that much weight. It does, however, give our little one something to hold on to and can sort of be propped to help it from not coming out as often. Plus, they  pretty cute!"
Baby,5.0,Holds my Starbucks perfectly!!!,"I'm This works well on the Mamas And Papas Urbo stroller! The handle is telescoping, so there's no bend in it (not parallel to the ground)- so I had a hard time finding a stroller caddy. This Diono one does the job- and by &#34;the job&#34; I mean carries my Starbucks and my Mom's (she's my shopping buddy). We use this mostly for mall shopping. You know you can't go to a mall without a trip to the food court or Starbucks, and it's too difficult to carry a tray of food while pushing a stroller while trying to balance the drinks. This caddy has held 2 grande's and a small coke all at the same time. No issues with the Velcro coming loose or ripping- maybe those people got defective ones or something. If you have a stroller with a telescoping handle- this is the drink holder for you!"
Baby,3.0,cute but doesnt fit well on crib.,"I love the look of it, but it doesn't fit well on my crib. Music doesn't last that long and u have to keep manually cranking it up."
Baby,5.0,works great with baby jogger city select,i have a baby jogger city select and this works so much better than the baby jogger one i had before.  its much more sturdy.  holds my drink better and the Velcro straps are strong but much easier to put on.  and a great price too.
Baby,4.0,Excellent,Only downside is to remove it to fold buggy flat. Otherwise great for convenience and stylish. Glad I got it
Baby,5.0,LOVE!!,"My baby LOVES this jumperoo, best part, this is one of the only ones that comes with a head rest for your baby so that they can use it before having complete control of their head."
Baby,5.0,Love,I bought two of these as gifts for my friend that was having twins.  Her boys both use and love these things.
Baby,5.0,Grand babies love these!,I have twin grandbabies who are just discovering themselves hands and toes and each other - these bracelets helped them to focus on something colorful while exploring their up close world.
Baby,5.0,5 star for fisherprice rainforest jumparoo,We can't go anywhere without it. She loves it! She loves all the attachments on it. Definitely a 5 star.
Baby,5.0,Successful With Granddaughter,"My granddaughter is 6 months old and really loves this bouncy chair.  She just got it for Christmas.  It is surprising how much she likes to jump around in it.  She works pretty hard at it and has a great time.  So far, the toys are not the main attraction for her. but I predict that she will get more involved with them as time goes on.  She likes the toys on her F-P ExcerSaucer quite well, so I know that she will play with the toys on the bouncy chair once the novelty of bouncing around hard and fast wears off a bit.  My daughter was pleased with this gift for her little girl.  I did have a hard time picking this bouncy chair from all the similar ones that F-P offers.  Product reviews on Amazon helped a lot.  Thanks to all the product reviewers especially those who listed specific comparison points among the various bouncy chairs."
Baby,4.0,Cute...but not for intended purpose (for my son),"I have had these for a couple of weeks now. My son never really seemed all that interested in them on his wrists/ankles. He is 4.5 months old. We have many other lamaze toys for him with similar patterns that he is completely fascinated by. He seems frustrated by having them around his wrists after a while.<br /><br />HOWEVER, he does seem to like to HOLD them, he likes them then. Of course, he loves to nom on them (the bugs have a gum-pleasing texture apparently!). I have also found that they wrap great around our play gym and his big sister likes to hold them up for him to look at. All babies are different!<br /><br />We recieved the product as promised, wrapped great with no damages. I am satisfied for the price I paid. Like I said, we are enjoying them, just not for their intended use!"
Baby,1.0,Would never recommend,My five year old shot it and The bow broke on the first shot. Not a good thing for Christmas morning.
Baby,3.0,"Great monitor for techies, but not always reliable.","I love this monitor, HOWEVER, I do not trust it to stay connected. Only twice has it disconnected and not reconnected while I was sleeping. I removed the passcode option because this prevents it from reconnecting automatically. Fortunately, I have a small house and was able to hear my baby crying (not from the monitor) which woke me up. If the nursery was further away from my bedroom, I would have to have another monitor just for sound. It travels well and easily, the setup is easy, I love the white noise option, and the video quality is great. If it weren't for the connection issues, I would give it 5 stars."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful addition to our toys and equipment...,What's to love...<br /><br />Stability<br />Color<br />Sound or not<br />Being able to turn to different stations<br />Comfort<br />Interest<br />Jumping action to develop those little leg muscles
Baby,1.0,Child does not fit. Unsafe.,"I bought this for my 4 month old who is constantly trying to jump and stand when I hold her. But she is still about 5 inches too short to reach the bottom (at 23 inches tall). So apparently your child will need to be between 28 and 32 inches for this to be used safely. I called customer service, and they confirmed that I had assembled the product correctly, and stated that my child &#34;just would need to wait and grow into it&#34;. Now I have to go through the trouble of trying to return it."
Baby,5.0,This is a MUST have!,"The Rainforest Jumperoo should be on every Baby Registry! My daughter loves the various lights and sounds.  We started putting her in it at just under 4 months because she had very strong neck and body control.  Since her little feet dangled above the ground, we placed a King sized firm down pillow under her. She didn't necessarily bounce in the beginning, but was very entertained nonetheless.  As time has gone on, she has figured out how to spin the 360 degrees and bounces up and down. It's a plus that it is gender neutral so when our next child arrives, it will be great for him/her. It also makes a fantastic gift for a new mom!!!  (I've given it several times and everyone LOVES it!)"
Baby,5.0,AWESOME!!!,"My new born LOVES this, he likes hugging it while he uses it. Fits in his hands just fine, we have tons of monkey stuff for him :)"
Baby,5.0,Good gift,"A good gift for a baby, they will be entertained with the rattles.  Lots of bright colors too.  The mommy's were happy with this gift."
Baby,1.0,SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK,Total failure of a product. We have upward of 60mbps in our apt and the camera fails to get a signal 80% of the time. DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!
Baby,5.0,Works with Avent Natural Bottles,"These work great with the new Avent Naural bottles. I love that the lids snap into the ring so the lid is one piece when you remove it to feed baby. This prevents them from getting lost/misplaced/falling on the ground and getting dirty. I haven't had any leaks. Overall very happy with these lids, my only complaint is that they don't come standard with the bottles."
Baby,3.0,"Daughter's favorite - if only it would keep working,","This mobile is precious - great soundscapes and super cute. My daughter is in love with it... In fact, she will not go to sleep without it on.<br /><br />I read the reviews prior to purchasing, and read that the mobile gets stuck when the leaves are lifting back up. I chose to buy it anyway, and we are actually on mobile #3 since purchasing late October. Mobile 1 just stopped working. Mobile 2 had the leaf getting stuck issue which really made our little one upset! Mobile 3 - So far, so good... So maybe third times the charm. I hope!<br /><br />Side note - let me say both Amazon and Fisher Price customer service are amazing. They have supplied our replacement mobiles when we came across the issues. Quick turn around too.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this mobile bc our daughter loves it so much."
Baby,5.0,cute little horse,"My grandson really likes this colorful, high quality little horse a lot.  He stares at it and focuses on it for several minutes at a time.  Nice purchase."
Baby,5.0,excellent product!!,Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase
Baby,4.0,Fits on Britax B-Ready,"Great for holding things you'd need to grab at a moment's notice.  Beats using the Britax cupholder; also, the velcro straps fit securely on the telescoping B-Ready handle.  The zippered pouch is nice."
Baby,2.0,Do not rattle,The Lamaze writs rattles do not rattle which is a disappointment.  I expected them to rattle but they do not.
Baby,3.0,Choke Hazard,"We started using the monkey wubbanub when my son was five weeks old.  He loved it and so did we for several months.  At four and half months though we had to toss it.  We caught our son choking on the monkey's arm.  He literally swallowed the arm and luckily,  my husband was able to pull it out of his mouth.  I think the age limit suggests six months, but I would recommend that parents stop using these once their child starts teething.  We never gave it to him without being present, and I am relieved that no permanent harm was inflicted."
Baby,5.0,Handy and functional,"This buggy buddy is useful on my umbrella stroller. I use it to hold drinks/sunscreen/keys/money for short trips to the zoo, etc. I do have to remove it when I break down the stroller, but it's a nice accessory to have when your'e going to be out all day in the stroller."
Baby,1.0,Not impressed,"One is a rattle the other is crinkly. The rattle you can barely hear, it sound so soft that my baby doesn't even notice that it's there because she can't hear it moving. I was disappointed"
Baby,5.0,Daughter loves it.,Comes in easy to open package. My daughter loves the different color and the different things she can do with it. Big enough that it's easy to find when a child misplaces it and not to big that a child struggles with it.
Baby,5.0,Recommend it.,My granddaughter is 5 months old and she loves it. It is sturdy and there are different toys attached to it. The attachment keeps her busy. I will definitely recommend it.
Baby,5.0,My little dude LOVES this!,"My dude has been fussy lately and can't seem to keep the bank in his mouth without us constantly placing it back, adjusting it. I bought him this wubbanubb for christmas after reading reviews. This is a great gift for a 2-4 month old baby! Maybe even older. He took to it right away. Napping the longest he ever has. It's worth the money. I will buy these as baby shower gifts for other people from now on!"
Baby,5.0,Amazing Jumper!,"This jumper is AMAZING. At 3 1/2 months old our daughter developed a love of jumping. We ordered this jumper based on the reviews and were not disappointed! Our now 5 1/2 month old LOVES it! She loves the jumping, music and toys! The blue elephant seemed to be facing away from her but we were able to unscrew it and twist it around. It is pretty wide but we were still able to break it down pretty easily to take it to the Grandparents' house. Its worth it to see the joy in her little face when she's jumping!"
Baby,5.0,Great for phil and ted,Great for phil and teds double dot. It does the job well cant really think of any more to say....
Baby,5.0,Wish there were more toys or options,I wish you could buy extra toys to go in the slots this jumperoo has. I feel the spinning salamander and spinning sun are redundant and the pop up tiger barely peeks over the bush. It would be cool to have a separate area where you could buy toys that fit in the slots. Build your own jumperoo essentially.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves her jumparoo,"We love this jumparoo! We bought it for our 4 month old, she loved it! She jumps like crazy and she enjoys all the activity toys. Keeps her occupied and entertained."
Baby,5.0,Great product,Love this product.  Use it on all my strollers (I have three).  Able to store stuff easier and out of the way.  Easy to put on.
Baby,3.0,Almost There (Updated),"I hope Withings reads this (UPDATED 3/27/2014)<br /><br />Three stars because they are ALMOST THERE:<br /><br />(1) Need PC/OSX support.  And I read Android support is terrible.<br />(2) Reinforce the flimsy mini-USB connector on camera.<br />(3) Crib mount needs to tilt and be wall mountable.<br />(4) Access Administration (set up accounts, restrict access based on user/date/time, view who is monitoring, viewer history, reset password).<br />(5) Enhance ability to reconnect if Camera or App loses connectivity.<br />(6) Upload at least one of my own songs, give me a bigger list to select from, or sell me songs to stream (to address DRM issues).<br /><br />By the way, I read lots of complaints about the broken temperature threshold.  Try using the Celsius scale (Withings is European).<br /><br />UPDATE:  We've been using this for 2 months now:<br />-Night time view is not as good as I would like, but we zoom in on his face and I can tell if he's awake asleep, or just threw up, so this is fine.<br />-The mini-USB continues to worry me, that connector does not look well anchored and the plug should be angled so that the wire does not protrude out).  It forced us to place the crib about 6 inches away from the wall so as to not pinch the cable.<br />-I notice that the zoom/view/alerts I set up on my iPad is synchronized to my wife's iPad.  So no individual user settings yet.<br />-Still no updates on the app from Withings.  Come on!  Outsource the development and get it done!  At least fix the Fahrenheit/Celsius issues!<br />-The music/night light function is extremely helpful.  If I notice he becomes fussy, I can remotely turn it on to help sooth him, saving a trip upstairs.<br />-My wife gave account/password to the Mother-In-Law (uh-oh).  The MIL is watching it via browser/iPhone all day long and calling us to give suggestions.  Please add account administration features so I can limit when she can watch!!"
Baby,2.0,Great camera...when in range,"When I first received the camera, I set it up in my office which was right next to the room we were using the camera in. When i relocated the office downstairs, the camera would not connect to my wireless router which was about 20 feet away. i returned it adn now have the infant optics. It works great."
Baby,5.0,Granddaughter,"This was bought for a xmas present for our first grand baby. It was very easy to assemble, which was a huge plus for grandparents! The colors and sounds are beautiful and it keeps baby entertained, huge plus for tired parents."
Baby,5.0,10+ stars,"The greatest invention of all man-kind, better than sliced bread!  The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.  I also read that the company plans on making another size smoothie for 6+ months! until then we are sticking with these.  Great gifts too!  I have bought 2 and will purchase more!"
Baby,5.0,baby magnet,My baby took this and stuck the pacifier in his mouth. He then got bored and started playing with the monkey until he wanted his pacifier again. Saves troubles of trying to locate the pacifier after the baby drops it. The monkey arrived quickly and was in great clean packaging.
Baby,5.0,Nice,"Smaller than expected, but it is for a baby, after all.  Would highly recommend this to an infant.  Thanks, amazon."
Baby,4.0,It got my grandson's attention.,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 3 month old grandson. While he was asleep for the better part of Christmas day, when he woke we showed the toy to him and he really seemed to perk up at the bright colors and interesting shapes. Time will tell if he will enjoy it as much when he gets a little older and begins using his motor skills."
Baby,4.0,It is a nice product,"My baby seems to like the jumperoo and I like to see her bouncing happy around. There is only one set back, she is 5 months old and she can't reach the floor with her toes, even though the jumperoo is on the lowest setting. However that is not a huge problem, I put some pillows under her feet's and then she is good to go 😊"
Baby,5.0,Get 2!,We have two of these. One for backup. Our son loves it and so do we. It's great cause it makes it hard to lose and easy to find at night in the crib.
Baby,5.0,Entertainment for hours,"I bought this based on all the good reviews that I've read and the fact that he loves jumping, and I was not disappointed. My baby's feet do not touch the ground so I place a box under it for him. Whenever I put him in it, he plays with the toys and jump until he's tired, which is at least 1/2 hour each time. After he's tired, he'll fall asleep in it as it seems pretty comfortable. The only thing I don't like about this is the toy elephant (agree with other reviewers) because it's hard to turn and baby's fingers can get caught."
Baby,2.0,unreliable,"it's good when it works, but every time we put it on we are looking forward to how it's going to be this time...whether it's gonna work like it is supposed to ooooor.....it will make us spend minutes or hours ( which also happens) to figure out what is wrong in a configuration settings this time, it loses connection or can't connect where wifi works perfectly, or it will tell you that video is not on when the monitor is open and video is supposed to be on, or it is being fetched forever... i mean, when it works, it is really awesome!<br />but i wish i worked more often!!!!!<br />and just to be added..i a technologically normal human being, never had problems with that...<br /><br />We got it as a gift thank god, otherwise i would be devastated to have paid so much for this device.<br />Wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I would say - get a regular online camera or not as sophisticated monitor, that works with bluetooth and wifi."
Baby,5.0,"Great product, EXCELLENT customer service!!","I have had my ibaby monitor for 2 years now and it is the very best investment we made!! The product is great, we never have problems with it! Our internet service provider has made several changes that have caused me to have to change the way our monitor is set up. Each time, Nicole in customer service has been MORE than helpful! She makes it so easy, and has incredible product knowledge. I recommend this monitor to all my girlfriends!!!"
Baby,5.0,Very pleased with this Jumper!,"My husband did a lot of research and read a million reviews for all the different jumpers and even the exersaucers. Overall we decided a Jumper would be better for our little girl. We went with the rainforest jumperoo because of all the wonderful thing we read. We did read a few negative comments but mostly it seemed like common sense issues.<br /><br />My daughter is 7 months old now, she was 6 months when we got it. She LOVES it.<br /><br />It was a breeze to put together also. It arrived at our door and was together within minutes.<br /><br />We put her in it and she was a little short (she was about 26.5&#34;), we had just put folded up blankets under her. Now she can reach all on her own on the first setting.<br /><br />I cannot think of a bad thing to say about it. If your child can hold its head up on its own and is long enough they will lobe this thing!"
Baby,5.0,Loved this Jumperoo,"Having three grandsons under a year old at our home for Christmas, we needed something to keep them busy.  This jumperoo was perfect for all their ages.  The 4 month old loved being able to sit, play, jump while watching all the activities.  The sounds were not annoying and because the seat twists around, he never got bored.  The oldest grandson, 11 months, was walking around furniture so he was not interested in sitting in the jumperoo, but liked playing with the action pieces."
Baby,4.0,Pretty Good,"I use it on our Baby Jogger City Select and while I like it, I don't love it.  I wish the straps were longer so it could hang down longer to better accommodate a water bottle.  I also wish the dividers in it connected to the bottom so that they were separate instead of allowing things to move around the bottom freely.  I do like the zipper pocket and the simple styling of the thing.  The price was good and I would probably buy it again considering my options."
Baby,1.0,One loop tore off after a year of use,"Worked well until one loop totally tore off (still strapped on to the stroller handle.) I am replacing it with the Britax version, hopefully that one will last longer as it is more than double the price of the Diono."
Baby,1.0,DO NOT BUY!,"Great idea gone horribly wrong. How are you supposed to rely on this monitor if it constantly disconnects? You wouldn't even notice that you are no longer connected. Zero piece of mind on this one! Any IP camera for a fraction of the price will allow me remote vision and even voice. Don't waste your money until they fix this and come up with a workable app and stable connections. Using Samsung Galaxy SIII and Note, not working with either one."
Baby,5.0,Perfect baby camera,"Very easy installation, full control of the camera over the internet, good picture, sound and night vision. Exactly what I wanted."
Baby,5.0,Fun,"Baby loves this item as it helps with development, and coordination. Very colorful and interesting for baby. Keeps baby distracted during changes and is washable."
Baby,5.0,7 month loves this thing,"Unfortunately I waited a while and was skeptical that my 7 month old son would be into this, but he LOVES it! Honestly if I had purchased this earlier it would have been too high for him even at the lowest setting and he is tall for his age. Not sure yet if the elephant toy thing on it pinches him. He cried once and I have a &#34;feeling&#34; that it might be it? Since I am not sure I can't say but when I do I will update my review."
Baby,1.0,Range is weak,"Want to love it and it has lots of potential, but continually drops signal even when I am standing right next to video unit to pair/view. Not worth the cash."
Baby,5.0,Cute dragon :-),"I got Dee Dee the Dragon for my daughter for Christmas. She really like it. There are really good sensory features like crinkles, mirrors, rattles etc. and it's also really soft and cute."
Baby,4.0,almost perfect,"My kid likes it a lot.  She's five months and she enjoys the lights, sound.  I put a book under her feet because she's too short to reach the floor to jump, which means this will last a long time, as she grows.  What makes it not perfect is that it's hard to get her into it, her body doesn't easily slide into the seat and her legs don't easily go through the leg holes.  The material was a PAIN to get onto the frame.  I finally grabbed a pair of hemostats to grasp the material and pull it over the little pegs.  It was like surgery!  When I had to take it off to wash I dreaded the task, but it turned out to be a bit easier the next time, getting it back on.  I was relieved and thought I was home free, but now the seat doesn't swivel as easily.  And this thing is HUGE.  It takes two adults to easily move it and it barely fits through a doorway.  Be prepared for it to take up a lot of floorspace.  People in small apartments or spaces should think twice about this model.<br /><br />Helpful hint:  to get the seat off to wash the liner, pop the legs off, then flip the seat over and push in the tabs, the seat will easily pop out of the frame.  When you reassemble it, make sure you don't twist the legs when you put them back in."
Baby,4.0,good buy,"Our little friendly toddler &#34;J&#34; loves to play with this and I think it is a big hit considering her age when we gave it to her and how long it interested her, and it is bright happy colors and make well!"
Baby,4.0,Baby Likes It,"Granddaughter has been using the Jumperoo since she was 6 months old.  She initially enjoyed it, went for a period when she only wanted to play with it hanging on from the outside (loves the attached toys) and now likes to jump in it again.  She spends a lot of time examining each toy. Like that it has adjustable height."
Baby,5.0,awsome,this is our 3rd one we puchesed for our 4th baby.he loves it.he jumps in it alot and the toys on it are nice.i would recomend a more cruncky meterial in the soft ears of elepant with a silk matierial . my last two boys love silk to chew on and rub their fingures on and rub on their face and add some tags .baby's love tags .
Baby,3.0,A love hate relationship,"I both love and hate this monitor.  With my second baby I knew I wanted a video monitor, and after extensive research and review reading, decided this M3 monitor looked like the best option.<br /><br />Pros: *Easy to set up.  My husband and I both use it on our Ipod Touch 5 and it was a breeze to set up.  You do have to plug it into your router the first time to activate it, but after that it's wireless.<br />  *Clear good picture, even at night.  The color is a little wonky, but we are mainly using it to see if the baby's really awake or just stirring around, not for award winning photos.  The night vision is really clear and can easily see if baby's eyes are open, etc.<br />  *Easy to maneuver around.  With just a swipe of the finger you can move the camera around the room to see all corners.<br />  *Easy to mount.  Screws and anchors included, & literally took 5 minutes to mount.<br />  *App is fairly easy to use.  The software is simple to use, though it's pretty bare-bones.<br /><br />Cons:  *The 2-way audio only works if you add on speakers, not included.<br />  *The cord is pretty short for a camera that needs mounted.  Due to the tilt restrictions, there was no way to see into the baby's crib without mounting the camera and an extension cord was necessary.  The camera plug is one of those big bulky ones, so we had to find something to rest it on halfway up the wall - kind of a hazard for something that's supposed to be installed in a baby room.<br />  *The alerts don't work when my ios device goes to sleep.  This is a BIG con...BIG.  Ios devices want to go to sleep to save battery, but for whatever reason the alerts don't go off when my Ipod goes into sleep / lock mode, but if you leave your screen on all the time, it drains the battery, so you have to keep it plugged in, which means you can't carry it around with you....not good.  Also, if you can't lock the screen the chances of your older toddler getting their hands on your Ipod and deleting some stuff ispretty high...also not good.<br />  *The FAQ from IBaby doesn't address the above issue, so I've contacted customer service to see if there is a work-around, but haven't heard back yet...<br />  *2 people can't really be in the app at the same time.  If 2 people have the app open and one changes the alert settings, it applies to everyone in the app.  So if my husband is at work and tunes in to have a look at the little one, and I have the alerts on, he's constantly getting the alerts as well...If he turns off the alerts, it turns them off on my device as well.  Kind of inconvenient.  It would be better if each user could set the alerts to their preference, rather than them being applied across the board.<br /><br />Summary:  Love that it's easy to install and great picture.  Love having video access to my little one's room.  Hate that the alerts don't work properly.<br /><br />UPDATE: I finally heard back from the company that makes the M3 with some suggestions on settings in my IOS device to make the alerts work.  Unfortunately their suggestions did not resolve the issue and then the alerts stopped working all together, even when the device was not sleeping.  I tried twice more to contact them with no response.  I contacted Amazon to see what my options were and they, thankfully, allowed me to return the monitor.  Based on the IBaby Labs customer service and the above listed cons to this monitor I would not recommend it if you intend to use it as a baby monitor."
Baby,5.0,We Loved This Toy!,"This was one of our daughter's favorite toys! We bought it for her when she was about 2.5 months old and she played with it until she was almost 1. She would play with this for a loooong time in the car or stroller. We also used it at home on her play gym and on her crib. It went everywhere with us. It was run over by our stroller, spit up on, and washed a ton of times. It still looked almost new when she was done playing with it. We have videos of her playing with it and pictures too. I was actually kinda sad when she grew out of it and we gave it to a friend of ours.<br /><br />It was a really durable toy, super soft toy. The colors were bright and fun. The different textures were great, and as she played with it I could see the wheels going on her mind, trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />This is now at the top of my list when buying gifts for babies or baby showers."
Baby,5.0,Great pacifier + lovie,"I've listed WubbaNub pacifiers as must haves for many of my friends who are having babies. Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though! Just make sure to wash regularly and always inspect the pacifier before giving it to your child.ifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do.

Baby,5.0,Jumperoo,My six month old granddaughter loved this toy.  She would happily spend hours jumping up and down if we let her.
Baby,5.0,great for kids,"great learning toy for youngewr children and grandchildren and we have seven and one on the way, would reccomend it to any parent"
Baby,5.0,Jumperoo was a hit!,"This was a gift for our little grandson's first Christmas. He was 4 months old and loved his jumperoo. Although his legs are still bit short, his mama put a board game box under his feet and he was in business for some serious playtime. Love it!"
Baby,4.0,complicated installation,"Is it more complicated of the fitting but overall it is an excellent product, but you have to buy a number of repeaters to work well"
Baby,5.0,Lots to do,There's such a variety of activities and the swivel seat allows access to everything without having to change out items.
Baby,5.0,Amazing!,"Love, love, LOVE this jumperoo!  It only needs three AA batteries and is incredibly entertaining for our 3 month old.  It doesn't take as much space as others we considered and we know she will grow into a lot of the activities.  It's great for twenty minutes of free time to do the dishes/laundry/etc."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for BabyJogger City Mini!,"Don't buy the babyjogger version, save $10 and buy this one!  It's great and durable and everything you need for your stroller!"
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves IT!,"My grand-daughter loves this jumper. It is very colorful and the music keeps her entertained for long periods. The straps are adjustable, so she'll be enjoying the jumper for at least a few more months."
Baby,5.0,About as much fun as a 5 month old can stand,"Purchased for our granddaughter because our kids had much fun in similar products when they were young. This is great! Child can jump up and down to their hearts content, swivel the seat around to play with imaginative toys at several &#34;play stations&#34;, and can induce the thing to play music by jumping (cause and effect). It is well built / sturdy. And the best attribute is that SHE LOVES IT! Our granddaughter has spent hours bouncing . . . second best attribute: our daughter-in-law gets more &#34;her&#34; time"
Baby,5.0,Get this!!,"This is a fantastic product, at a fantastic price.  We have ours on a City Mini Jogger, and it enables you to carry a decent amount of items (wallet, and 2 drinks for example) and is not at all intrusive.  You can also keep it on the stroller when you fold it up."
Baby,5.0,All I need,"This is all I need added to the stroller.  Great for keys, an adult and little person's drink, cell phone, mittens, dog leash, etc....all the little things you want on hand."
Baby,5.0,Best baby toy we've purchased!!!!,"We got this for our 5 month old daughter and at first had to put a pillow under her feet, but once the springs loosened up it fit perfectly! It keeps her entertained for well over 30 minutes at a time and she jumps every night before bedtime and first thing when she gets up. Thd seat turns easily and she seems to really enjoy turning to all the different toys. Also like that it's gender neutral in case we have any more kids."
Baby,5.0,Organizer for stroller,"This item was a must for our Baby Jogger city mini.  We didn't have anywhere to put drinks, keys or cell phones.  Problem solved!  Looks great too."
Baby,4.0,Great for freezing breastmilk right in the bottle!,I bought a pack of these to use so I could freeze pumped milk right in the bottle so that all we needed to do was thaw and it was mealtime!
Baby,2.0,Eats batts weekly!! Works sometimes.,"I must admit the first time I installed this toy on my babies crib, he loved it right away.<br /><br />Thing is that is uses 3 expensive batteries that last just a couple of days (been using energizer batts not the cheap ones).<br /><br />First thing is that this really needs a plug so you can connect it to an outlet.<br /><br />Second, the fist time I replaced the batts with new ones, when the palms start to raise, they seem to pause at the middle of the movement for about 20 seconds, like its stucked. This is a major flaw because when this happens, the baby just stops paying attention ant looks somewhere else.<br /><br />At last, I stoped using the motion and now it sits just as a toy with music but no movement."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,Works perfectly with my baby jogger city mini stroller and way cheaper than their name brand version! We love it!
Baby,5.0,Rescued by Sir Prance A lot!!!!!!,"Bought this for my grandson for Xmas<br />He loves it!!!<br />Scrunchy, colorful, rings to grab and the knight is soooo cute.<br />It's quickly become a go to fav toy!!!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy,"Can't go wrong with Lamaze toys for your little ones. I purchased Sir Prance a Lot for my 4 month old nephew, so he would have something to play with on the stroller.  He really lights up especially for this one (I also got him another Lamaze and he definitely prefers this one). I have probably purchased 10 of these over the last few years for the various children in my life and haven't heard any complaints yet."
Baby,1.0,Would be a good product if it didn't keep disconnecting.,"When it works it is great.  However it keeps keeps cycling from &#34;now you can monitor your baby&#34; to &#34;monitor is disconnected.&#34;  I have to leave it off and turn it on when I want to see, then turn it off again so it doesn't keep alerting all night long each time it cycles between monitoring and not.  We have tried everything to fix it.  Now we are looking for another monitor.  Great idea, wish it worked reliably.  Poor customer resources to address the problem."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!!!,"My 5 month old loves this jumpy! This is the one thing I can go to if I need to cook, do homework with the older kids, or get ready!"
Baby,5.0,baby loves it,My granddaughter loves it. She loves the lights and the jumping. Her legs have gotten strong and she s starting to stand up.....
Baby,5.0,Great product.,Withing Smart Baby Monitor is a great product.<br />Easy to use.<br />Easy to install App.<br />Easy to configure.<br />Very interactivity.
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub -  Monkey,A lot of parents purchased the item.<br />The baby loves it.<br />easy to find<br />The baby easily can take it out and put it back in her mouth
Baby,1.0,Stopped working after 3 months,"This mobile looks good, but it stopped working after warranty is expired. I'm so disappointed. I have to buy a new mobile, but definitely not this one. The quality of this mobile is horrible. I would not recommend this mobile to anyone."
Baby,3.0,She just play with it,My 4 months old daughter plays a little bit with it. But not that much like with other toys. She gets bored easily.
Baby,3.0,super cute but had no interest,i like the idea of this very much but my baby unfortunately had no interest in the pacifier. i would prefer if you could easily swap out the pacifier.  it would also make it easier to clean.  how does anyone regularly clean toys like this?  the animal part gets soaked.
Baby,5.0,DON'T HESITATE ON THIS ONE !!!!,"My 6 month son loves this activity toy. I have no complaints about the quality, safety, design or operation of this item. All 5 stars in my opinion. Amazon had it to my door sooner than promised."
Baby,4.0,Great Affordable Product,"I am very pleased with this organizer. It is just what I need. I didn't need anything fancy,  just something to put my keys, phone and a drink in, so this was a perfect purchase for just that. My stroller offered one that was much more expensive, and this was a much more affordable option for just what I needed. I could see this being adaptable for practically any stroller."
Baby,5.0,Love Lamaze Toys!,"My son loves all of his Lamaze toys - we have Captain Calamari, Stretch, and Sir Prance A Lot.  He is almost 9 months and has been playing with them from the beginning.  I don't know if this is recommended by Lamaze, but I toss them in the washer and let them air dry.  They are super easy to clean which makes them great to take in the car or on trips.  These toys are always much cheaper on Amazon."
Baby,4.0,Good Jumperoo,My 5 month old really enjoys this jumperoo.  I like that there is nothing for him to hit his head on as with some other jumperoos out there.  I think the elephant toy is a little annoying.  I guess its a toy meant to get your child to try to turn it around.  Its so taught that this seems difficult.  The music is ok.
Baby,5.0,Love it,"I was so glas I went with this one. We purchased the City Mini and for those of you that own one you know that as expensive as the stroller is it doesn't come with an organizer you need to purchase that separate. They sell the organizer but its $30 which I didn't want to pay after paying almost $300 for the stroller. So I took a chance with this one and love it. The other review state that it didn't hold great but we loved it. We were in Disney in October so it was a bit chilly in the mornings and it held both my husbands and I coffee from Starbucks without it spilling, We put our room keys and park cards in the zip pouch. At one point we had 3 water bottles my daughters thermos cup our room keys and park keys and my cell phone in it. The good thing is that when you fold the stroller it folds with it"
Baby,1.0,This Chimera did not operate with me after what I tried in every way,This Chimera did not operate with me after what I tried in every way Allmemkna - It seems that the defect has regretted buying it no longer trust the seller - and recommend no confidence in it is Dishonest
Baby,5.0,Our son loves it,Great product.We had to raise it up since he is getting taller but he loves it so much. Worth every penny.
Baby,5.0,A must-have for the paci-lover,"Our son LOVES his Wubbanubs. The monkey is his favorite. I do wish (like many others) that the pacis could be removed. I wash them in the washing machine in a mesh bag, and eventually the pacis do get worn. But there is nothing similar that is better. This is by far the best paci-animal toy out there."
Baby,5.0,The music is NOT annoying! Yay!,"This is one of our MUST-HAVES for baby. We actually have a boy and bought the unisex version of this, but bought this one for our niece. The music is actually kind of catchy - you'll find yourself singing it in the shower (if you actually have time to take a shower these days!) The play mat is great with the sides up for keeping nosy dogs out of baby's face. The inserts are sturdy plastic and so they don't get saggy. You can remove the inserts to wash the play mat."
Baby,5.0,This jumper is greats!,"When I took the childb out of his Jumperoo, heb screamed sound loud it was just like dragging an alcoholic  outbid a bar!!!"
Baby,5.0,Great!,My 4 month old son loves this jumper! His feet just touch enough so he can bounce on the lowest level. He loves the lights and music as well as the toys around the chair. I would recommend this for sure!
Baby,5.0,Totally satisfied ',I thought it was great they did just what they said  . It arrived just when they said it would and my grandson loves it! So does his mommy. Thank you. Will difinately order again.
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"My 6 month old absolutely loves his Jumperoo.  Once we get him in it, it is hard to get him out."
Baby,5.0,This is a must have for your bouncy baby,My son absolutely loves this toy.  He gets in it and jumps his heart away.  We're going to visit relatives in another state and will be taking this with us.  It is a must have for any parent who could use 10 - 15 minutes to get things done.  This was more expensive than the competitors but worth every penny.  My son is five months old and is in love.
Baby,5.0,Wrist rattles,My niece loves these.  They stay on her chunky little wrists and she loves looking at them and chewing on them.  When she hears the rattle sound she'll start laughing and shaking them harder.  I think it's safe to say she loves them.
Baby,3.0,Stitching came out!,My 4 month old loves his Wubbanub. The stuffed animal is cute but after only one day of use I noticed that the stitching was coming undone. I didn't contact the seller just stitched it back up myself. I also bought a Dino Wubbanub and the quality is much better.
Baby,2.0,Not buying again,My Daughter had no interest in these wrist toys at all- I would not buy them again nor recommend them
Baby,5.0,Love it,This product is so cute on any baby seat.  It does a great job entertaining my 9 month old son.
Baby,3.0,Cute but perhaps not the most durable mobile ever.,"We were excited to find this mobile because it matched our jungle-themed nursery and we loved the waving palm leaves. It's really cute! The only problem is that after about 3 months, the big leaves stopped working. The leaves would go down but wouldn't come all the way back up again, and that stops the mobile from moving completely. We changed the batteries a couple times, thinking that perhaps the batteries were getting too weak to keep the leaves moving, but that didn't help. We ended up taking the 3 big leaves off the mobile so that the other parts could move again. It's not as cute though without all the leaves, and it's disappointing to have his mobile break after only a few months. There are several things that I really do like about the mobile and that work quite well. I like the remote control; we don't use it terribly often, but it works well and is nice when we want the music to continue but don't want our son to see us. I like the sound options: jungle noises and three different classical composers. Although the &#34;night light&#34; isn't bright and can't be used as a regular night light, our son likes to look at the lit up jungle scene. I also like the option between three modes: music only, music and mobile, and music, mobile, and light. Allows us to save some battery power!"
Baby,4.0,Hours of entertainment,Short simple and to the point.<br /><br />The Good:  It has a big mounting bezel that should fit any crib.  It makes a plethora of noises to entertain a wee one.<br /><br />The Bad:  I really wish the timer was longer.  We often find our wee one awake in the crib and the mobile off.
Baby,5.0,Awesome,Baby girl loves this thing. She is very very spoiled and will not do anything alone. But she will bounce in this by herself for at least an hour. I love it!!!!!
Baby,5.0,Perfect Toy,Bought this for my 5 month grandson and he just loves it and I will be buying another one for my other grand child also :)
Baby,5.0,so cute,"when your baby drops it, it doesn't roll away.  very cute.  i give it to all my friends with new babies."
Baby,5.0,Much better than the Jungle Jumperoo,"We just received the Rainforest jumperoo yesterday and our 4 month old loves hanging out for about 15-20 so far. The items to play with are much better than the Jungle theme and I actually prefer the Rainforest base much better!<br /><br />The little bug with the fabric wings hangs over the edge and is floppy. I'm not sure if that is right? The assembled picture from the box has it standing straight up. Other than that, I can't wait to watch our little one as she grows with this toy!"
Baby,5.0,My child jumped himself to sleep last night,"Before purchasing this product, I read all the customer reviews.  They were very helpful, so I felt confident placing my order.  However, I wasn't prepared for how much my 4 month old was going to love his jumperoo.  After figuring out all of the bells and buttons, he discovered he could jump.  Now, I can place him in his jumperoo and fold laundry, get the dishes done, run the vacuum.  Last night, we prepared and ate dinner all while he played in his jumperoo.  He eventually jumped himself to sleep.<br /><br />So if you have an active, curious child like I do, this is a fantastic product.  I can't give it enough stars."
Baby,3.0,fun fun,"This toy is fun for baby to hold and examine, my only complaint it that the mirror peeled OFF?? But my son loves it the same!"
Baby,1.0,Two months claiming no answer a theft,Worst purchase didn't work return it and refused to return my money sent me another camera that does not work either stole Me the worst shopping experience
Baby,5.0,excellent,excellent product. High quality. I loved it. My baby has enjoyed super useful. Best. It has been an excellent purchase
Baby,5.0,Keep your kids trapped for an hour at a time!,"My daughter loves this thing.  She will bounce and play with all the toys for 30min+ before she gets sick of it.  It's great for keeping her from getting into trouble while I'm getting ready in the morning.  On the other hand, it's pretty large, and definitely not the easiest thing to move around.  Requires 2-handed maneuvering to get through a standard interior doorway, which is annoying when you're trying to move it while holding your child.  It's obviously meant to be easy to disassemble, which would be helpful if you wanted to use it while traveling."
Baby,5.0,Colorful and fun!!! Great item and great price.,So cute and nice size. I love the different legs and the colors are so bright. My daughter loves it. Works great on her play mat as well as her car seat.
Baby,1.0,Disappointed,"This monitor does not work with the current ios operating software and directions and customer service have been disappointing.  I would not recommend purchasing this product at this point in time - great concept to view on your mobile devices, but no luck."
Baby,5.0,"Great ""old time"" wooden Bow and Arrow set",Very nicely made simple toy bow and arrow set.  Wooden arrows with rubber suctioned tips.  Indian head dress and target cut out on box. Bought them for 5 and 6 year old grand sons for Christmas and they loved them!
Baby,5.0,A must have!!,We love the jumperoo but not as much as our two children have. This has been a lifesaver in our house. We are on our second child using the jumper and it has stood up superbly! The assembly was super easy and fast so we were using it within 20 minutes of opening it up. The unit has three levels of height so it last for a pretty long time while your child grows. I like that you can turn the music on or off and it has a volume control (high or low). The lights and activities included keep the children entertained and engaged without overwhelming them. The seat cover can be removed and washed which is a nice way to keep it looking clean and new. It is not the easiest thing to put back on but the ability to clean it makes it well worth the effort to take it off and put it back on. I also take off the toy attachments on a pretty regular basis and wash those down since the little hands and mouth are on them at all times. I would recommend this to any parent!
Baby,5.0,I don't what we would do without it!,"my littler girl just love this thing, she is 11 months now, but she loves it now more than ever!"
Baby,5.0,Daughter loves this,"My daughter could play in this practically all day if I let her! She has been using it for 3 months now (we bought it when she was almost 5 months) and does not seem to get tired of playing in it. Highly recommend! One funny thing about it, I do notice that she always seems to poop not too long after she starts bouncing around, so if your baby ever seems to be constipated, let them jump around in this for a little while, it just may be a natural solution!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for our baby,This is a great pacifier that the baby can hold onto a lot better than the standard ones. Sometimes he gets particular and will only take the Wubbanub.
Baby,1.0,Poor quality,Hard to set up. It does not connect to wifi easy. The passwords so not match the set up.<br /><br />Getting intouch with the company is impossible.
Baby,5.0,Perfect alternative,I have the citi mini and didn't want to spend $30 on the matching cup holder. This was the perfect fit. It fits like it was made for this stroller. Never gives me and issue.
Baby,5.0,Bought for our 1st grandson.,"Our grandson is having a great time in the jumparoo, and his legs are getting so strong. Great entertainment for him and us."
Baby,5.0,Holds more wipes.,This is a great product. It holds a lot<br />more wipes than the usual. I have twins so I need to carry more. Also I found it fits in most clutch style changing pads.
Baby,5.0,Happy baby & happy mom,My son absolutely loves it. I had read so many great reviews about it and they were all true. Definitely worth every penny.
Baby,5.0,My Son Loves it.,"Took me 10 to 15 mins to install. My son is 3 1/2 months old, 17lbs and 27 1/2 inches long. Lowest setting and he can slightly push off the ground. He's not strong enough to turn in the seat yet."
Baby,5.0,Great quality,"I got this as a gift for the baby shower and the mother to be loved it. Its cute, super soft and very practican, I can imagine!"
Baby,5.0,great idea,these things are pretty neat and your kid will love them. and it helps comfort them too. only bad this is im afraid my nephew might be going to pre school with it lol.......just kidding
Baby,5.0,Clean often--your baby will love all over it! -- updated with a warning for older kids,"After stumbling into my six-month-old's bedroom in the middle of the night and searching around her crib for her paci in the dark, I posted a little rant on Facebook about how pacis should glow in the dark. A flood of friends commented that I need to forget the simple paci and graduate to the wubbanub.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, I'll try it. After a month, i love it! Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />--my daughter can easily hold it and put it in her mouth. She doesn't quite have the motor skills to get the nipple of the paci in her mouth without the Wubbanub attachment.<br />--The hands and feet have little beany things in them, which makes them fun for my daughter to chew on. She's teething now and I think those beany things provide a nice texture for her. The fabric material of the Wubbanub is also soothing to her while she munches down on the feet and hands of the little monkey.<br />--It's machine-washable! Wahoo!<br /><br />Cons:<br />--This thing is filthy. My daughter has been chewing on it a lot lately because of the teething thing. In fact, she doesn't really use the paci part at all right now. So because the fabric part is in her mouth so much, it's a really dirty toy. I would absolutely recommend buying a darker color Wubbanub and washing it often. I have friends that have lighter color ones and they just look so, so dirty and gross.<br /><br />--My daughter is in a dropping phase. We love toys that can be hooked onto her seat or stroller. Unfortunately, this monkey Wubbanub cannot be hooked onto anything. I could probably improvise by either making a hook thing myself with a suspender clip and ribbon, but it would be great if this came with a loop that I could hook a ribbon or other pre-made device through.<br /><br />All in all, my friends are right: the Wubbanub is fantastic and my daughter absolutely loves it!<br /><br />Updated 5/13/2016<br />When my second daughter was born, we bought another monkey &#34;Wubby&#34; for her and she has slept with it every night since she was about 3 months old. I put a paci clip through the hole in the pacifier so she can have it attached to her pajamas and never lose it at night. This has been the perfect solution to every missing paci issue.<br /><br />However, a couple of weeks ago (when she was 18 months old), she bit off the tip of the pacifier. I couldn't find it anywhere and assumed she swallowed it...I found it yesterday on the living room floor (no idea how it got there). I contacted the company to let them know what happened and to ask if this is normal. Most of my friends have wubbys and use them for years as their security toy. The company said that the Wubbanub is not for older babies--just babies 0-6 months old and that they are working on products for older kids. SOOOOO...bear in mind that the Wubby is only for babies 0-6 months. The company refunded my money, which I thought was an incredibly nice gesture that I didn't even ask for.<br /><br />I let my 18 month old have the monkey part of the wubby with the nipple cut off so she can't chew it off any more. The monkey stays with her in her crib at night and is her favorite toy/security item.ept with it every night since she was about 3 months old.

Baby,5.0,Fabulous!!!!!,This is the best thing for babies crib. They love it. In fact my daughter had twins and her two year old will not give it up. He has to have it on every night when he goes to bed. So I bought two more for the twins. Each of her 5 kids had one on their crib.
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE this monitor!!,"I can't say enough about this awesome camera! Clean, clear images..even at night! Super easy to set up! I actually had my 12 year old look at it while I was answering the phone and she had it set up and running in under 5 minutes!! It's so reassuring to know that if I have to leave my two year old home with the hubby, I can still see and hear everything  in real time(she has epilepsy so I worry leaving her)<br />I love that you can move the camera around remotely and even zoom in. Since having it, I don't have to go in her room to check because she has moved out of the camera's line of site.<br />Customer service is superb. All questions answered immediately and thoroughly. I highly recommended this one over other similar devices. Just by friends seeing it in action, 4 of them have bought one as well! Also nice as a second layer of security when we are out of town! This is one item you won't have buyers remorse with :)"
Baby,5.0,Baby like...,"The baby really liked this one.  I personally do not see the appeal as it is just a stuffed animal with all the bells and whistles, but the baby really went crazy for it.  I feel like I don't understand babies very much, but I guess this company does!"
Baby,5.0,our baby won't stop bouncing!,This is lots of fun for a 5-6 month old who can support his own head.  He loves this so much - so many features which are unique and require different motor skills. It was easy to assembly and seems stable and baby safe.  He loves it!
Baby,4.0,baby monitor,Easy set up and works great.  Able to take pictures and see the child even from other locations outside of the home
Baby,5.0,Best baby monitor out there,We've had a few and this one is amazing.  Best camera.  Wide lens.  Looks great in the day and has a night vision mode.  Let's you zoom in HD into the image.  Mic is awesome.  Works remotely on any phone or computer as long as its connected to your home wifi network.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves this,"My baby loves jumping around in her jumparoo! It's helpful to me, too, because it keeps her occupied for at least 10 minutes, and it also can make her tired...she's fallen asleep in it on more than one occasion. She loves playing with the toys, and is constantly reaching for the blue frog above. I've even seen her go on her tippy toes!"
Baby,5.0,I own 3!,Fits great on my single city mini and 2 on my double britax b-agile.  Great value and works great for what we need!
Baby,1.0,Disappointed,"I used only some days and already dont works anymore...Im very disapointed with the product. In Brazil, we dont have support"
Baby,5.0,Great mobile,"This mobile fit into our green, jungle themed baby's room perfectly, and the price was great. It easily attaches to the crib. Baby loves looking at the animals, and the music is very nice, not your usual tinny knock off baby music."
Baby,5.0,My baby girl loves it!,"Jumperoo arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  Some assembly was required, but it was very easy.  My daughter loves the attached toys, and the hanging birds.  It is a bit bulky, but worth it because she loves it so much."
Baby,5.0,Awesome,My 4month old daughter loves it I recommend this bouncer just make sure your babies back is strong enough to stay upright.
Baby,5.0,LOVE,My little guy loves this jumper! 3 settings are awesome especially when you have a fast growing boy like mine. Love the sight & sound reward for jumping but my 15 wk old figured out he could just hit the bar instead of bounce. He jumps anyways and there's lots of other things to do. Only thing that's a stinker is the 360 seat which takes an adult to turn.
Baby,1.0,Device not what is advertised,"****Review in a nutshell:  BUY A DIFFERENT DEVICE, THIS ONE DOES NOT WORK AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE, SAVE YOUR MONEY*****<br /><br />It is unfortunate that overall the video baby monitor category is just so terrible.  We've tried the summer line, but the device's kept failing, so in a pinch ordered the Withings Smart baby Monitor.  The initial setup took a few tries and a good long charge before it worked, but eventually we got the device working.  However, it suffers from three major problems:<br /><br />The iPhone app just sort of sucks.  It works in the most basic function, but the notifications and multiple account features have never worked so my mother in law continues to get notifications that the humidity int he room has dropped too low.<br /><br />More importantly, you cannot keep a connection to the monitor.  This is probably the most important problem, as the monitor drops the connections, is unable to reconnect.  This usually generates a notification, but then you have to wake-up and reconnect the app.  We live in a modest sized apartment and can literally see the wireless router from all the rooms and the nursery.<br /><br />Lastly, the customer service that I have now been exchanging emails with for the past two weeks is pretty terrible.  There is no, speak with a human support.  Each communication takes a day to respond, and they ask you to make the same changes over and over, not surprisingly they don't work.  I have requested a refund multiple times, but have never received it.  Overall this is a couple hundred bucks down the drain."
Baby,3.0,"Fun toy, not as useful as I thought.","I'd suggest to anyone looking to buy one of these to try it out first and see if your baby likes it. I had visions of my baby spending 15-20 minutes a day in here unsupervised, so I could take a shower or eat something or just be, you know, alone. He will jump and play with the toys, but not for very long, before he starts whining to be picked up or put somewhere else. Also, the swivel chair doesn't swivel very easily for us: my baby only faces outward toward the main toy bar (he has to crane his neck to see the sun and the lizard, forget about it). Kinda useless unless it's easy to swivel around (he's only 7 months, maybe it'll get looser?). The rainbow is not very intriguing for babies; I wish there were more light-up parts. The music is okay, and the parrot/lizard hanging don't get any love from my baby. It takes up a HUGE footprint in the living room though, and you can't take it apart very easily. I think in hindsight I would have rather purchased a smaller one."
Baby,5.0,Great,"It was just you would expect from Lamaze, they make great toys and the baby loved it which was the most important part!"
Baby,5.0,great features and works perfectly,"Love this mobile is remote, and if you want to shut it off simply double tap a button to turn off. it automatically turns off after a given time, so you never have to worry about it keeping the baby awake. This replaced a much more expensive mobile and we are much happier with this one"
Baby,5.0,"Love, love!","I bought this for our twin grand daughter's. It was loved so much we bought another Fischer Price Jumperoo. They jump and play so hard in them, they fall asleep in them. A must have, if you have multiples!  Great quality, very sturdy, lots of great colors and toys to keep your little occupied."
Baby,5.0,Cute!,"I bought this for my newborn, but as it turns out, my 15 mos old really wanted it because she thought it was pretty cool! Great for a range of ages, even though the pacifier itself is for a younger range."
Baby,3.0,It's cute but wipe drys out,I love the cute little red botton on it! It's great that you could hang it anywhere it gets handy but the wipe drys out within days unless you only put in enough to last just one day
Baby,5.0,THE BEST Pacifier,"I initially order one for my son, since he love it, I ended up ordering several more as gifts for friends and family.<br />it s easy to wash, and keep clean jut brought it in the wasting aching and that is it.<br />I highly recommend this toy-pacifier."
Baby,5.0,Awesome and fun for all babies,My Grandson loves this Jumper! It has so many things to look at and play with! I think it is his favorite at 6 months old!
Baby,5.0,Such a fun toy!,I love dragons but a lot of toy dragons are for boys. Love this has pink on it. Daughter likes the noise it makes. Very satisfied with it.
Baby,5.0,great toy for baby,My son loves his jumparoo.  We put him on it and he just go buckwild.  Jumping up and down. Definitely recommend.
Baby,5.0,great toy,Great toy  grandchild loves it. Friends have been finding and buying some like it. Great brand also have the knight
Baby,5.0,My Granddaughter Loves Dee the Dragon!,"Dee is one of those toys that holds a child's interest.  Not a one and done.  There is so much to this darling dragon toy.  Textures, sounds (crinkly), colors galore, and cuteness, cuteness, and did I mention cuteness?  The stroller hanger is a plus.  Great buy."
Baby,5.0,Happy happy bouncy baby,A must get for a strong active baby boy or girl.  It isn't small but hey ...who need floor space when baby has taken over pretty much everything anyway
Baby,2.0,Could be different for others,"Our little one just didn't like it. It could be different for others but there is not much interaction that can be done on others like I have seen. Like others have said, one of the toys just flops to the side but our little one liked to put it in his mouth. The toys that hang from the top are just for looks, you cannot reach them or touch them, the toys on the seat, in my opinion are for older children (mine was 6 months when we tried to use it and is now 8 months) they take a lot of strength to turn the toy, etc. I have just seen some really interactive bouncers now that have toys you can add, take away, etc. I would definitely recommend looking at other options for the price."
Baby,5.0,Best thing ever,This little thing spared my sanity. My 13 month old has used a variety of wubbanubs throughout the past year. They have some kind of magical soothing quality. Buy one. Or six.
Baby,4.0,"Great concept and handy, IF you have a strong internet signal","I love this monitor! It has great features! BUT you need a strong internet signal for it to work properly, both where its installed and on your handheld or the streaming gets interrupted a lot. Overall, great buy."
Baby,5.0,Grandson loves it!!!,This is my grandson' s favorite pacifier!  Having the stuffed animal attached makes it easy for him to hold on to it.  They also make a great baby gift!!!
Baby,5.0,Must-have,I absolutely love this carrier. It's come in very handy all around town and even a couple trips to Disneyland. We never take it off
Baby,5.0,so cute,my son loves this mobile! the music sounds good and I like that you can have the mobile off but still have the lights on the bottom portion of it.
Baby,3.0,wish could be better,"I am disappointed it goes offline way too often... not sure what the problem is. I love this monitor, but for some reason it doesn't work properly sometimes. Also, have been trying to find support and have not been able to."
Baby,5.0,Great learning toy!,I bought this for my grandson. I was pleased with the durable construction and quality of the toy. The different textures are great for developing senses. And it's machine washable. I also bought the accompanying cloth story book.
Baby,4.0,works great,It was a little difficult to set up for first time use but just follow the directions by the number and it will make it easier
Baby,5.0,Perfect addition to your diaper bag,I really like this wipes case.  It's easy to load and to use when on the go.  I like that I can refill with my own wipes and it holds a lot more wipes than I expected.
Baby,5.0,"Ugly toy, but my kid loves it",I cannot believe how silly this toy looks.  But my son just loves playing with it.  It's totally worth buying.
Baby,5.0,Easy To Set Up And Use,"This camera is easy to set up and use if you take two minutes to follow the directions. You can use the software that comes with it for basic set up, but you can then peek at the settings and use that to point your web browser to the built in web-enabled control screens for more options. It's very useful to be able to see and hear what is going on at home using the iPhone app. Be sure to change the password to something besides the default for security.<br /><br />Update 2017.07.25: two iBaby M3 cameras have been in use continuously since August of 2013 (four years). We use them for elder care purposes. If you connect some low-cost self-powered speakers the two-way audio can be useful when interacting with home care nurses. It takes a little Googling but you can use port forwarding on your home router plus dynamic DNS as one way to make the camera accessible from outside the home. The iBaby app is ok, but we have used the FoscamPro app to view and control multiple cams (iBaby M3 can be added as if it is a Foscam FI8910W).<br /><br />Both power plugs failed recently within weeks of each other. An affordable replacement is<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DTOYN3Y/"
Baby,5.0,5 month old loves it!,"This is so much fun for him.  Following someone else's suggestion, I put a pillow under his feet because he's too short to touch the floor, even on the lowest setting.  Now he loves it for jumping and playing.  There are so many entertaining things for him to touch and look at, lots of noise makers.  He has a great time.  He isn't fully sitting up on his own yet, but he doesn't have to in this - the seat cushion offers lot of support to keep him upright.  It was easy to put together, didn't need tools, and has three height adjustments - he'll probably outgrow the weight limit (25 lbs) before he gets too tall."
Baby,5.0,Where have you been all my life?!,"Honestly, I would have paid much more for this item. We got it when our baby was 16 weeks, and she just loves it. Her eyes light up when the music and lights turn on. She also loves the bouncing sensation (a nice change from being on her back or tummy). Best part for mom, I have my arms and hands back while she is playing! It is very cute, but beware, it is pretty big. I didn't realize it when I ordered it but luckily we have the room."
Baby,4.0,Jumperroo,Bought as a gift for granddaughter.  She seems to be<br />enjoying it immensely.  She's very active and this<br />seems to fit the bill for her.
Baby,5.0,Ready to go,My grandson loves it! He sit and plays with the attached toys. Being able to sit higher makes him happy.
Baby,2.0,Too Many Problems,"When the monitor is working it is alright. Quality isn't great but good enough. Has good features like music and lights and being able to turn those off with my phone or iPad is a plus. Biggest issue is that is stops working frequently. Either it won't connect with the iPhone/iPad or the online feature to monitor child from the computer doesn't work.  That feature hasn't worked for over a month and nothing has been able to get it started again. For the expense of the product, it shouldn't have to be reset so frequently. I would not purchase this brand again."
Baby,5.0,Very good,I don't know exactly why but it works better than any other pacifier. The baby is more able to find it and put in his mouth. This is the only pacifier that he uses. It's easier for him to pull it away and throw it far. But still it is very useful and recommended. Especially when going to sleep he holds it well.
Baby,5.0,LOVE THIS JUMPER,"Our five month old son LOVES LOVES LOVES his jumper!  He has been using it since he was about 3.5 months old.  Although he is a bit short still, we have the topper from a small leather ottoman underneath him.  He gets a TON of enjoyment from this jumper.  He plays in it every day.....sometimes for about 45 minutes to an hour."
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Jumper,"I am so glad that I purchased this item, my grand daughter had a great time in her jumper on a daily basis while watching her program she's one now and doesn't care to much to get in it. But that's ok it was sturdy enough to last until her baby sister get big enough to get in it."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves his Wubbanub!,"These are so convenient to have for baby.  Easy to grab and hold.  Baby likes sticking his thumb into the other side and holding it in his mouth, so cute.  He really enjoys this Wubbanub."
Baby,5.0,Granddaughter loves this,"Of all the toys she has, my 4 month old grand daughter absolutely loves Sir Prance Alot.  Very colorful, and loaded with little tabs that babies love to grab.  Well worth the money."
Baby,5.0,Very cute,"This toys is exactly what it is: cute, soft, cuddly and entertaining.  It would be hard to mess up that toy really. It doesn't make much noise, but it never says that it does.  The mirror is a average quality for a mirror, but you won't use it to touch up your make-up or anything, so it's good for baby. I like the fact that it hangs so low and that my baby can just grab it easier at 3 months."
Baby,1.0,Don't Do It.,Doesn't work. The company is replacing it with a new one but I have to send the first one back before they will replace it. Lame.<br /><br />The customer service person has been good but the product just doesn't work.
Baby,5.0,Definitely worth the money!,My 5 month old baby loves jumping in his Rainforest Jumperoo. Great quality and very safe! Keeps him very entertained while also getting his exercise.
Baby,5.0,WubbaNubs are awesome!,"When my grandson's old WubbaNub Monkey got befriended by the neighbor's dogs, it was a sad event. But Amazon to the rescue-and the old was replaced with a new WubbaNub monkey!! These WubbaNubs are so cute and people comment on them all the time during an outing. What a cute way to hold a pacifier. I highly recommend WubbaNubs! They are soothing for babies and very much loved by them."
Baby,5.0,PARENTS AND CHILD VERY HAPPY,IT IS BUILT VERY WELL FOR THE PRICE AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND USES IT EVERYDAY. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
Baby,5.0,can even a 32 oz drink from Mcdonalds,"just letting everyone know i have a graco ipo stroller this is for Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Organizer<br />i bought a babies r us cup holder that has 2 pockets that one sucked big *** that one sucked for the cup holders i couldnt even put a 16 oz coke in it, i would have to strech the cup holder part out just enough for it to wiggle enough so i could put it in, so after 2-3 times i was sick of it, so i was on the hunt for a bette found one, i found this one and the cup holders dont fall :) i ordered 2 one for me and one for my friend, i love that i can put my sons cup, a larg container of food from safeway, and a large 32 oz of soda (full bty), and my sons 9 oz straw sippy cup, all in there together, fits great, and i didn't even have to fight it to get anything thing, oh i also have my ipod, and phone in the zipper  it, and compartment, and my keys whitch has a medum size turtle on, and 4 keys on it, all in there great, kind had to wiggle to fit the turtle in there, but other than that they all fit great, no spilling, no tilting, and no fighting to get anything in there, i also tried everything without the cup holders, because some people have tried it with the cup holders and with out, and just wanted to see if they would all fit nice and snug, and even with my keys too, so anyone that is trying to look for an organizer with deep drink holders and deep pockets this is it!!!! I love mine :)"
Baby,5.0,Great,"Received as advertised, on time and new. Bought it for my nephew. Lovely toy for development. Would recommend to all parents."
Baby,2.0,High hopes,Horrible... Do not buy! We had a great wi if signal then even tried hardware connection still with connectivity issues. We had a summer monitor as our mainstay because we knew it would stay on through the night. Then one day the withings just quit and was only a year old and we tried to contact technical support and customer service was horrible! The summer monitor is still kicking after 5 years... We liked the withings temperature and humidity feature and was nice to peep in on the babe during date night but this product is just not what we expected . Durability and reliability get a F -grade:(
Baby,5.0,Very useful and easy to attach.,"Happy with it, very easy to attach and can fit two drinks (I suggest closed bottles) and your phone and wallet or small toys."
Baby,5.0,Best Money Spent!,My daughter LOVES this jumperoo. It is the best money I've spent recently. She is full of giggles and smiles as she jumps and plays with the toys. PERFECT!
Baby,1.0,Too unreliable,"Bottom line is that the unit does not stay connected.  When it works it's good, but it doesn't stay connected very long.  And customer support is not effective."
Baby,5.0,They LOVE it,"Both my baby girl and baby boy love this toy, they interact a lot and have a lot of fun while playing there. Just watch out for some dirty clothes after sometime, because since they move a lot... well, you know what happens. The good thing is, it is also easy to wash. It is a bit expensive, but the return on investment is very high!!! I recommend."
Baby,4.0,Thank heavens for great customer service,"UPDATE: JULY 2014:<br />I raised my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because of Withings fantastic customer service. One of my twins broke the monitor, I think she kicked it really hard and not only broke the micro usb cord itself (part of it got stuck in the monitor), she also broke the micro usb connection to the circuit board inside the monitor.  I contacted Withings customer service and they helped me figure out that this wasn't a simple fix, and since I was within the warranty period, I sent the broken monitor back and they sent me a new one!  I thought for sure we'd go through some long process of sending it back to fix it and I'd be without a monitor for months, but this went really quickly, and I soon had a brand new monitor in hand.<br /><br />I still have some connectivity issues), but you can't beat customer service like that.  Thank you Withings!<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br />I really want to like this, it looks beautiful out of the box, set up was relatively easy, and then the issues started...  My iphone and ipad both drop the signal from the monitor ALL THE TIME!  It seems like is nearly always either loading or just plain disconnected.  I live in an apartment, so I can actually hear any baby noises from one end to the other, so I rarely rely on this for sound, but the video is why I registered for the monitor.<br /><br />We've tried reconfiguring the location of our wireless router to see if that would help to no avail.  One thing I did find that helped some was just unplugging the monitor and plugging it back in when the connectivity fails repeatedly.  The old \\""have you tried turning it off and on again\\"" trick...<br /><br />Overall, for this price, it needs to maintain a connection.  I literally just lost to the connection to the monitor as I wrote this review.  Better go check on the babies, since I can't rely on my expensive technology to work."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"We originally purchased a different make/model, and honestly our little man wasn't impressed. We returned that one to the store and made this purchase which we couldn't be more pleased with!!"
Baby,5.0,we love wubb,"my baby has had this wubb from when he was a week old, he's now almost 8 months. we love it. we always get complements about how cute it is. it is very convenient because its so big, its easier for our baby to find it on his own when he loses it in his crib"
Baby,5.0,Excellent Product.. Works with Android....!!!!!,"The best camera that I could be chose...<br /><br />Works with Android, easy to install.. You can be hundred miles away in see what is happened in the room's baby.."
Baby,5.0,Does a great job at a fantastic price,"I had considered buying the Baby Jogger brand organizer for my City Mini GT, but I'm glad I went with this one instead. It's easy to secure, looks like it was made for my stroller, and I have no problems when it comes time to fold my stroller up.<br />I have had one spill, but it was an open cup, and I should have known better.<br /><br />This is exactly what I was looking for."
Baby,2.0,Great product with appaling customer service,"I bought not one, but two withings baby monitor. Simply the coolest product ever. Amazing looking, compact, and good quality pictures. Awesome when travelling, or for grandparents who can watch the baby live on i-devices or computer... but wait...<br /><br />the customer service is JUST WAY TOO BAD!!! I have one of the monitors which stopped functioning well in november - literally 40 days after purchase, and 4 months now, still i have not got the product fixed. there is no phone number, the customer service is done only over email. and, it is just not fast enough.<br /><br />withings really need to get their act together. no point selling thousands of gadgets when they can not offer post sales service.<br /><br />I hope some withings managers see this help me out fast!!!"
Baby,5.0,Best Large Toy!,"My son loves this! We got it when he was 4 months old and by the second time in it, he was bouncing like crazy! Easy to put together (I did it myself) with a very sturdy base. He'll jump around and play with the toys for 30+ min. Best purchase!!"
Baby,5.0,The greatest jumparoo!,"I had this jumparoo for my little man and it was the greatest thing that we had for him! I bought one for two of my grandsons! We tried several for our little guy and they did not come close to being as awesome as this one! Being a Mom and a Grandma, I can say that this is my favorite item for any little one!"
Baby,3.0,Just OK,"I'm not sure what the big deal is with these Lamaze take-along toys. They are pretty cheap looking, and my baby was not particularly interested in it either. She mostly just chewed the mirror, which caused the reflective coating to scratch off. Yuck. There are better toys out there. We prefer lovies or soft books for the car. Tiny Love also makes excellent stroller bars that are way more fun for about the same price."
Baby,5.0,How did we live without this?,"Impossible for my baby to spit her paci away now! This keeps it close enough that even if it's out of her mouth, she can get it back in! Genius idea! LOVE IT"
Baby,5.0,Constant Companion,Our twin girls love them! They provide comfort for them when in the crib. One of their favorite toys as well.
Baby,1.0,streams to off site server,"This should be stated in very plain English for everyone to see.<br /><br />ex. While you are in there nursing, you are streaming your camera feed to a server that does not belong to you.  Think of the pervert, sitting in an off site location, watching all these feeds (and potentially recording it all).<br /><br />You don't get a choice to stream from your own home directly, it must go to an external, withings owned server, in order for you to stream your camera over the internet.  I get how forward ports are hard for folks and how this makes it easier for everyone, but this is an invasion of privacy on a high scale as millions of mothers are streaming their nursery outside their home."
Baby,5.0,one of the better ones out there,"my baby loves it.  She would be crying when we put her to bed and once we turn it on she gets quiet immediately!  Everytime when she cries in the middle of the night, we just use the remote to turn it on and it automatically soothes her and we dont have to craddle her back to sleep!  we have the leaves part until she's one, mostly we just have it moving with the music, no light.  Then once we took the leaves part we started to turn on the light just in case so she has something to &#34;mesmerize&#34;.  As she gets older i just leave the music on.  Now shes 19 months, we still have it, but to turn on only if she cries in the middle of the night.  Great purchase and the longest running &#34;baby stuff&#34; we used since she was born!"
Baby,5.0,Happy Baby Happy Parents,"I bought this one above other Jumperoos due to the number of great reviews.  I am not disappointed, it takes the place of the saucer and a doorway bouncy.  Our LO loves it and so do we.  I would highly recommend this to others.  *note one person said the elephant is a potential hazard.  I agree, it is very tightly attached and both her father and I think it could pinch little fingers."
Baby,5.0,Good!,"My baby don't like it at the first ,but after a while he enjoy it!!he loves the toy and he love to jump,I only let him jump for 20mins,and he really really love it,nightly recommend!!"
Baby,3.0,Very cute,This is so cute and works well. My baby was just not very interested in any mobil though. I did love the music it played and the clicker that turned it off from a distance. I would have liked it better if it had a way just to have the light on and not the music or movement.
Baby,2.0,Very cute but over priced for the use you'll get out of it,My baby loved this brand and themed play mat/gym so I got her the kicking one. She liked it for a little while but quickly grew out of it. The mat I got was not made right. The side plastic piece didn't have the hole in the right place for the mat to secure in place. It didn't make a big difference though. Definately way more money than it's worth. Your baby won't be using it for very long.
Baby,4.0,Love the app- wish picture was clearer,"We have been using this monitor for the past 10 months and we really really like it. I basically live for this so that I can see when she actually goes to sleep, check if I REALLY need to enter her room or if she's just being restless, etc.<br /><br />Pros-<br />The app means you can look in on baby wherever you are (which one of us will often do if we are out while the other is at home with baby)<br />Love that you can turn on music via app<br />Love that you can turn on nightlight via app<br />Love that you can talk to baby through app<br />Movement and Noise sensors are neat<br />Threshold alerts are useful<br />Large viewing area (can see a lot of crib and room)<br /><br />Cons-<br />Not super clear picture- especially when not in night vision mode (works infinitely better at night in the dark)<br />Noise sensor is only useful if you don't keep music/sound machine noises on all night (which we do)<br />Movement/Noise sensors only go back 15 minutes"
Baby,5.0,LOVE it!!!!,I read a lot of reviews on other bouncers and jumparoos and was terrified by all the horror stories of them tipping over and such. This jumparoo is awesome and sturdy. My twins love it! They can turn all around in the chair and love the bounce. Stays completely put on carpet!
Baby,5.0,Super-cute but no true off button?,"Our 5 month old loves this thing and just bounces to his heart's content.  But why isn't there a true off button for the sound?  We and our dogs bump into it all the time and it starts the music...not a huge deal but considering it eats batteries, I'd like to be able to turn it off!"
Baby,5.0,Greatest,I love this product. Very durable. I have come in many time to my baby hanging on this and it doesn't snap off as previous one have. It is multi directional and plays good music. What else can you ask for!
Baby,5.0,Love Love Love,"We have twins and they are in love with all the Lamaze toys. Each foot has a different texture, when you jiggle it it clanks when you squeeze the knight it squeeks. Every time our babies play with it they find something new!"
Baby,5.0,fun toy,Love this little horse with a prince.  Very well  made and lots of play with all  the different things on one toy.  Very happy with it
Baby,5.0,4 Month old loves it !!,Granted my son has parents that are both above 6 foot so he is long as it is .. top 98% for his age to be exact. He absolutely loved the Jumperoo from the moment we put him inside it. He looked around and jumped instantly. My only concern is with some of these reviews stating that the springs may break. Otherwise no other concerns in regards to quality .. Just wish this thing broke down a little bit more for moving purposes.<br /><br />Still an amazing product !
Baby,4.0,Very very very cool,"The image quality is great, so is the sound. The fact that you can access it from anywhere is invaluable. Brilliant idea :)"
Baby,5.0,Great for my Maclaren triump stroller!!!,I use this for my maclaren triump stroller and it serves the purpose.I even just leave it attached and it stays just fine.very sturdy and bought a second one for my other stroller too! Thank you
Baby,5.0,Great Quality,"We purchased this jumperoo for my grandson's use.  His little legs give the thing a real workout.  To say he enjoys it is an understatement.  I would recommend its use at around five months old, when babies are able to somewhat sit up with assistance.  With the adjustable spring straps it should remain entertain him for quite some time.  Thank you Fisher-Price."
Baby,5.0,really useful!,"I use it every day, and it is delightful to take a look at my baby boy during the work. And be sure everything is all-right.<br />At home, I can close the dor and se everything, including at nigth, from my living room, at the comfort of my bed... You can even see the eyes, if are open or closed!<br />It is also useful to play lullabies and to talk to your baby, during the work.<br />Loved it! Would by it again!"
Baby,1.0,Garbage,"Do not be fooled by the pretty package and high price. This thing is junk. They obviously put it on the market before they made sure it worked. I could go on and on about all the things that make it not work, but trust me, it just doesn't  work.<br />The worst part is that the company has zero support. After 5 emails and hate mail on their Facebook site I finally gave up.<br />They don't have a phone number and don't respond to emails. Its very frustrating.<br />Read the reviews, I'm not the only one. This thing is crap"
Baby,5.0,Absolutely Brilliant,"It has been almost 6 months since we bought our Smart Baby Monitor. Besides a server issue lasted for a couple of days, the unit worked flawlessly. Its performance relies heavily on your home network and Internet connectivity, if you are planning to monitor your baby away from home. While at home, it offers bluetooth connectivity as well, which eliminates the need for a wired or wireless network. Threshold adjustable motion, noise, temperature and humidity detectors provide further relief for you and/or your day-care assistant."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it,"There are a lot if parts in the box, but it's easy to install. It look sturdy with quality parts. My son is 7 months old and we have it on the lowest setting. He has time to grow into it, well worth the money."
Baby,5.0,Bouncing baby boy loves this,A lot of stimulous for a six month old baby boy and he absolutely loves all of it.  No complaints at all.
Baby,3.0,Doesn't like it as much as the firefly,"Ended up hanging this over the changing table to distract my 5 month old while changing his diaper.  Sometimes he plays with it, sometimes he ignores it.  He does seem to like the mirror and the rattle.  We received a Freddie the Firefly as a gift after purchasing this giraffe, and my son vastly prefers it.  He will always spend some time playing with Freddie if he is any where near him.  Freddie also has a lot more &#34;activities&#34; than the giraffe."
Baby,3.0,"Good Camera, Difficult Setup",The camera has been great as long as you are in the house and have a dedicated wifi setup for it. Setting up the VPN and all has been very difficult and it comes with no instruction on how to do this. The instructions it does come with are not well written and do not explain how to set it up in its basic settings. Luckily I am techie and can figure it out on my own.
Baby,5.0,love it,"It is perfect I put my cell phone ,my coffe my car keys I really used it I put it in my babys stroller mamas&papas"
Baby,5.0,Awesome price and quality!!,"I was really surprise when I see it! I almost got the BabysRus Brand for $10 and an ok quality. The zipper inside is cute and fits my phone and wallet , the cup holders are good for my ice tea and baby zip cup. It fits in my Quinny Zipp with no problem and I was  having a hard time trying to find accesories that fit on it and are not more that $30 bucks each! When I finish using this in the stroller I think I can use it in the car as snack organaizer that I can put on the back on the car seat.<br />Awesome price!! Thanks amazon for the fast shipping too!"
Baby,5.0,SON LOVES IT!!,I PURCHASED THIS FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. MY 4 MONTH OLD HAS THIS SAME ONE AND LOVES IT! SAVED TIME AND MONEY PURCHASING IT HERE ON AMAZON!!
Baby,5.0,We are happy!,Our baby girl is happy with Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo! She very like to jump and play. We advise to buy it.
Baby,5.0,Baby AND bulldog approved,"We purchased this toy because giraffes were our &#34;theme&#34; for our baby. This toy is a welcomed distraction to going in to the car seat. The colors are vibrant and the mirrored foot is baby's favorite. It was such a hit that our bulldog helped herself to it as well, it is now a 3-legged giraffe!"
Baby,1.0,No Good,"I have chosen this product because  of remote view, function that I can talk through and promise HD streaming.<br /><br />The only thing I like is design.<br />- No HD<br />- Every Android device I have tried 3-5 seconds delay plus every so often disconnecting.<br />- Voice take forever to get from mobile phone to IP cam and you can not understand nothing.<br />- Customer service told me that is probably because of slow internet connection (I've got 120Mb/s) and to try with cable connection I did try and the only improvement was when I stream online to  their website, then they told me to try with iPhone or iPad which I don't have so I give up. Any way if you look on reviews in Appstore you can see that the problem is the same.<br /><br />I don't recommend this product to anyone don't waste your money."
Baby,5.0,I can find this anywhere,I love this paci! I can always find it in the car seat and my son loved the monkey. Great idea!
Baby,2.0,Nowhere NEAR worth the price paid,"We've had issues with this monitor from the get go, but since we had set it up before baby was born and started using it after she was born, we figured we'd just stick with it.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this monitor and I really wanted it to work. But the bottom line is, it's just awful. Extremely unreliable (shuts itself off at random), terrible picture, 3 second OR MORE lag time, which frankly is unsafe, the battery compartment is loose and continuously falls out...and now after a year of use, the electrical cord no longer will charge the unit so the camera is basically useless as it never charges.<br /><br />Now I'm left to find another camera/monitor system as this one has been and currently is, USELESS. Don't waste your money."
Baby,5.0,Best Tummy Time Toy,My son hates being on his tummy for more than a few minutes. He loves this toy! He's on his tummy for at least 10 minutes and is starting to explore the toys. Great buy!!
Baby,5.0,Babies love it!,"We have 7 month old twins and we make them take turns in the jumperoo.  They love it and when one is in it, the other eyes her anxiously, awaiting her turn!  I like that it entertains them, while giving them some great exercise.  We've recommended it to other new parents, whose also had good results.  The animal sounds and music are entertaining for both the babies and ourselves when we watch them jumping with big smiles.<br /><br />I don't normally write a lot of reviews, but this product is fantastic."
Baby,5.0,It is great.,"According to our granddaughter who is using it for our great grandson, it is working very well and they love it.  They should, they selected it and we were delighted to purchase it for them."
Baby,5.0,Best invention ever!!!,I have 5 kids and didn't discover these until my last child.  These are just as discribed.  Life saver at night... no midnight dark searching for the pacifier it is easy to find in the dark:)  Now my daughter is old enough and we don't have to help she finds it all by herself.  Love this thing!
Baby,5.0,Perfect,It perfectly fit to our baby pushchair Bugaboo Caneleon. It is very strong and easy to wash. Very good buy; I recommend it
Baby,3.0,delivered broken,looks great was super pumped to get it up in going for my boy but a clip was broken called customer service though she was really nice we will be getting a new one soon hope it works great
Baby,5.0,Technology,"This miracle of Technology, did everything that it was supposed to do. It stopped the milk from coming out of the top of the bottle.  I would recommend this to all my friends who would like to prevent milk from coming out of a bottle"
Baby,4.0,cuddle and holds pacifier,its hold the pacifier in the mouth so its good for claft lip and palat also the baby likes to cuddle
Baby,5.0,Happy!!!!!,I've couldn't be anymore happy with this product! My son LOVES this thing so MUCH! Every penny was worth spent!
Baby,4.0,great monkey,i think this is the one of the cutest monkey plushes and baby pacifer a baby could use two thumbs up
Baby,5.0,Perfect to help baby do their nights,"This camera is great! By looking the camera before entering the room, you can see if baby is crying but still sleeping or not. So you are not waking him up."
Baby,4.0,Lamaze Wrist Rattles,These are cute a little small on the wrist but for a infant about 3m would be great our baby my just be chubby lol
Baby,4.0,My little girl loves this!,Great addition to our play area. I saw a lot of reviews regarding the elephant posing a problem. I was able to turn the elephant so it faces the other way and does not snap back to catch on fingers or hand.
Baby,5.0,Our daughter's #1,"We had originally bought a swing thinking our daughter would love it, but after she was a month old she wanted to be upright if she was awake.  She loves to stand so we bought this and put books under it until she was tall enough to reach the floor.  She absolutely loves this thing.  She will light up when she is going in and laugh as she bounch around.  The several different toy options keep her constantly entertained while we are cooking or cleaning.  It would be nice to have more toys she can bring to her mouth beyond the butterfly but all in all this thing is awesome."
Baby,5.0,lamaze toys are the best!,Great little toys for all the tiny people in your family.  They are enjoyed for many months and played with over and over!
Baby,4.0,"good fit for normally sized baby, fun & interactive","we tried the FP Luv U Zoo Jumperoo, but it turned out all wrong for our little man.  we sent it back and got this one instead, based esp. on other reviews, and it was an instant hit!  besides actually fitting our baby properly, and offering him fun and interactive options, it also plays cute and very tolerable music, with playing time and volume options, which are very useful.  i would definitely recommend this jumper."
Baby,4.0,My son loved it,My son is very active and when we put him on this jumperoo he enjoys it a lot. I recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Fits and works perfectly for MacLaren quest stroller,"I've had this for a year now, and it is still great. I never take it off my stroller, actually always leave it on when I fold the stroller (unlike another reviewer mentioned). It is cheap but doesn't look it, durable and easy to clean. It is much better for drinks and various items than any other drink holders I had bought before (The type that is a cup holder and clips on one handle). The only small downside on the quest stroller is that it makes it difficult to use the window to look at baby. But now that my baby is older and a toddler I don't really need that feature so much so it's ok."
Baby,5.0,Jumperoo Fun!,I bought this jumperoo after reading reviews and I'm glad I did. This jumperoo is high quality and has a lot of bright colors and toys for my son to play with. He started using it at 4 months and is still loving it at 6 months. Highly recommend.
Baby,4.0,Wish I had bought it sooner!,"Exactly what I needed! Great price. Looks nice and fits well on my uppababy stroller. May not support heavy drink well, but fine for my phone, keys, water bottle, etc. Wish I had bought it sooner."
Baby,5.0,Only pacifier that worked,"Our son was not a pacifier-friendly baby, and this was the only one that he could tolerate (and actually played around with) for longer periods.  In the end, we had to get a couple, because one would occasionally go missing.<br /><br />Will definitely buy this again for any future siblings. :)"
Baby,5.0,we love wubbanubs!,"I believe we have ordered this wubbanub monkey about 4 times. My daughter has loved wubbanubs since she was born (she is 2-1/2 now) and the monkey is her favorite. since she does have a full set of teeth the pacifier will get cracks in it and we cannot give it to her anymore. We just order another one and she doesn't know the difference. She has also had the wubbanub duck, giraffe and baby doll. When the pacifier got a hole and needed to be removed from the baby I just detached it and now the baby is her favorite thing in the world."
Baby,5.0,So much fun!!!,"We are not sure who is having more fun! Our daughter bounces, talks, and sings to everyone that will listen. We watch and laugh constantly while she is playing. Check the dimensions and make sure you have room for the jumperoo."
Baby,5.0,Best baby purchase yet,"This is the best money I have spent in a long time. When my son was about 4 months old, he began to need to be entertained a lot. Seeing as it was the dead of winter, I don't know what I would have done without this. He absolutely loves it. If you are trying to decide between the jumping stationary versions of this type of toy - definitely go with the jumper. Way, way more fun."
Baby,5.0,Loves his jumper,My son's feet did not touch the ground he is 5 months old and 26 inches long. We placed a cushion under it and now he can jump away. He loves it! So much so that he fell asleep while jumping last night lol.
Baby,5.0,great!,"These work perfectly for mixing formula with both the Natural and Classic Avent bottles.  Just don't forget the blue sealing ring on the classic bottles or you'll get formula everywhere. (but you'll only make this mistake one time!)  I've also read that people use these to turn the bottles into food containers.  I haven't done that yet, but I think it would work well since liquids do not leak."
Baby,5.0,Works perfect!,"Setup took a bit of thinking, but not to bad, works great on all of our ios products. Love that we can view from anywhere."
Baby,4.0,One of the best baby monitors out there.,It works great. At home using wifi and lLAN or outside on a 3G/4G network. I like how it moves 360 degrees and pans around. My only complains is the electricity cable is too short. Especially that most people would want to hang their camera on the wall. So the solution is to either have the electrician move your electric socket above or use an extortion cable which looks ugly on a wall with wires dangling.
Baby,3.0,meh,"I bought this hoping that we could get my then-four month old preemie to at least tolerate a little tummy time. We tried for two months to get her to use this (periodically -- we didn't force her on it all of the time! More like every few days we'd try again). By the time she had any interest in the mat she was rolling off of the spinner first chance. I'd save my money an just get a normal mat, or even use a blanket."
Baby,4.0,I love this toy my only comment is about the knight,My baby loves his toys because of the different textures and colors. My only comment is that the knight is to hard to squeak to be sincere put other then that is very good and cute toy for your baby.
Baby,4.0,Jumperoo VS Jolly Jumper,We had a jolly jumper and returned it for this jumperoo. My toddler loves the jumperoo BUT as they grows up she seems to be losing interest in it. She bounces around and then falls asleep in it which is absolutely adorable by the way but that seems to be the extent of her activity in the jumperoo. It takes up more space than the jolly jumper which folds up but this has a lot more bells and whistles and as a result is the winner over the Jolly Jumper in my opinion.
Baby,1.0,Child's arm became stuck...,"This thing does not get my approval.  I noticed my 4-month old was only using her left hand to play and became fussy.  I looked to maybe adjust her to another boring toy and noticed she spun and her right arm became stuck between the elephant ear and spinning harness and was turning red.  The elephant does not spin in a way to easily dislodge a child's stuck arm so I had to calm her and slowly spin her the opposite way while stabilizing her curious hand and freed her arm.  This is by far the most boring, single tuned baby hazard I have seen in a while.  The activities make your baby have to look over the edge of the spinning insert for a limited view of fixed elements to apparently explore.  It plays one boring tune and makes her fussy.  I do not recommend due to the hazard issue I experienced and glad she got fussy to realize what was happening and I was sitting with her the whole time...it has enough room to get an arm in to be stuck and not enough room for a curious baby to easily remove said stuck arm without potential harm.  Do not buy this boring safety hazard."
Baby,5.0,Loved by babies.,My friends grandkids loved the giraffe so I bought it for my soon to be grandchild. Hope it is as loved and used by mine.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I really wanted this product for the obvious reasons, ease of use with my cell phone and iPad, daddy could check in from work and see baby ad feel more connected, I could actually see baby and feel more comforted when he moved to his own room. Let me tell you it has just been one big disappointment. From the beginning we just get a bunch of connection interrupted messages and it takes turning if off and back on to get it up and running again if it will run again without rebooting the entire system. For a monitor that is suppose to give you instant piece of mind it really just gives you a headache. My baby started sleeping through the night in his crib and I found myself waking up throughout the night to a blank screen because the monitor had lost connection and shut down. The worst part about this is baby's room is right next door and the main wifi port is just down the hallway, I feel there is no excuse and this product really shouldn't be on the market until they work the kinks out. I now use a sound monitor and will wait to buy another video monitor until I can find something reliable. This was just a very disappointing $250 investment."
Baby,5.0,Good buy!,My twin boys absolutely love this binki. It worked so well and now that they are older they still enjoy playing with the animal.
Baby,5.0,No Complaints,"I thought the toy was super cute. The rings on the back are sort of hard so I would recommend buying for someone a little older but other than that, I have no problem with the product. Don't spend more than $10.00 on it though. And if you can get it on sale, even better!"
Baby,5.0,Love this!,We bought this for our four month old and she loves it!!! She loves that when she moves the songs play.
Baby,2.0,Not worth the price,"Good idea to be able to stream when you're away from home.  When it works, it's good (not great).<br /><br />If you are able to set it up easily, you'll like the baby monitor (hence all the positive reviews).  When you run into ANY issues at all (and most people will run into some issue at some point), you will hate the monitor, it's trouble-shooting guide, and Withings customer service.<br /><br />I've had connection issues in the past (I had one phone connected and wanted to connect another phone).  I followed the steps set-up guide/FAQ (and I'm usually pretty tech savvy) and it took me about an hour of button pushing to &#34;fix&#34; it.  The instructions were useless, and I still don't know exactly how I got it to do what I wanted it to.  And mind you, there's all of ONE button, it's how long and how frequently you push it that determines what the resulting action is.<br /><br />I also get annoyed with the color/infrared camera.  There are some types of light where the monitor has trouble picking the correct viewing mode.  It would be vastly (and easily) improved if you could force the monitor to use a certain camera seeing as how your eyes are the ones viewing the screen...<br /><br />Finally, I've had the monitor for under a year now, and it refuses to charge.  I have an email out to Withings Customer Service, but I'm not very optimistic.  I will get back and update my review once I hear from them.<br /><br />If this monitor cost around $100, the issues I've had to deal with would be reasonable.  However, for the price tag and the Apple association, I expect both product and customer service to be flawless.  They are not."
Baby,5.0,baby loves it!,My baby is 3 months old and loves this jumparoo. Its great for the baby to sit up and mine is already learning to jump and play with the toys. My babys legs are to short to reach the ground. Blankets were not sold enough and slid around to much so I put my nephews child size step stool its perfect! It gives the baby a soild non slip surface that helps them kick and bounce.
Baby,4.0,Verry good Product,Verry good product.<br />I'm in Africa I like this verry good<br />this product in new<br />My baby like this and verry enjoy
Baby,5.0,Baby Loves This Bink,I bought this pacifier as a Christmas present for my now 7-month old nephew.  He absolutely loves it.  He's able to grab the toy and put it back in his mouth.  His mom said it was the best Christmas gift he received.  They also ordered another one as back up.
Baby,4.0,jump jump jump,My son loves jumping up and down and playing in this this jumper.  Assembly was fairly straight forward.  Needed to put a few books under my son for the first few weeks as it was a little high for him even on the lowest setting.
Baby,5.0,horse,baby gift for newborn... mother seemed to like it and hopefully the new baby will also... Very colorful.. attractive little hanging toy.
Baby,5.0,Does the job and holds the goods!,"Very good stroller organizer. Nice and sturdy, easy to put on my City mini, it's not flimsy and it's never come off by accident. Can't beat the price, good product. I've put large soft drinks in it as well!"
Baby,5.0,Great for newborns,This was the only pacifier that would stay in because it would lie on his tummy and because he wasn't rolling it would stay in.  He has this one and the puppy. The puppy looks cuter than the monkey in my opinion - but both have served their purpose and get a lot of comments from people too. Very cute. Easy to wash - just throw in the washing machine. Very happy with these and definitely recommend.
Baby,5.0,good quality,"No more spills when taking his bottles of milk, water and juice to places and no more problems with liquid waste in his bag."
Baby,5.0,Bounce!,Best thing ever! My 5 month old granddaughter would bounce all day! I live for FaceTime calls so I can watch her squeal with delight as she jumps!
Baby,5.0,Great service!,"Love the wubbanub, got it as a gift for my baby shower. Haven't lost it yet! And baby loves it. Bought it for a friend. Bought it from My Monkey Soup, LLC --simply put, great service! Ordered it Monday got it by Friday the same week! And the price was pretty decent too compared to others.  Couldn't ask for more!"
Baby,3.0,"The red ""botton"" closure comes off easily","Like the design and its capacity. The thing is, the red button thing that slides from one side to the other comes off VERY easily. I constantly take the case out of my diaper bag and find it gone..."
Baby,5.0,Great,"Great toy, my child has used this since she was born and after a year and a half we have had to replace it. The nipple is sewn to the stuffed animal so you have to clean the entire piece.  Easy for toddlers to carry."
Baby,5.0,my 5months son loves it,"Did a lot of research and read reviews, I purchased this because of the bounce mose reviewers mentioned.<br /><br />This thing has a good amount of bounce and my son loves it.<br /><br />The only flaw i can think of right now, is that it's hard to remove the seat cover, this is the material that will be gone on and off for washing/cleaning."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Great jumperoo! This is actually the 3rd one I've bought..... same style and everything! I would recommend it to anyone!
Baby,5.0,"Work great. And yes, they work with Natural bottles.","Using these on Natural bottles. They work. I fit them on the white ring first, then put on bottle.  I like that I can save some space using these instead of nipples and covers."
Baby,5.0,Work with Avent Natural bottles,"I wasn't sure if these would work with my Avent Natural bottles, but they work great. You just put it on in place of the nipple. It snaps highly into the white screw ring.<br /><br /> I don't use them often since just storing and traveling with the full bottle regularly assembled works just fine."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"My son (who is now two) absolutely loved his jumperoo! He was a big baby, so he outgrew it pretty quick, but we lent it to my sister for her little guy, who also adored it. We are looking forward to the arrival of our second baby and I'm sure he or she will have a ball with it too! When I go to baby showers, I always look for (and hope) this is on the registry, because it's a great gift that's really enjoyed!"
Baby,4.0,Great Fun Time !!,"This jumparoo is great!  It has lots of different toys and colors for the baby & the seat turns full circle, so she can have her favorite in front of her!  The lights are bright & eye catching & she tries to grab them - which starts her bouncing!  The height of the seat is great & with the stand - it is safe & she can't move it or bump into anything.  The only thing I think could be improved is the seat somehow??? She is 4 months old & it is fine for now but will soon outgrow it.  It seems to be very deep & leg holes seem small making it tricky at times to get her in & out of it.  Other than that - we are both thrilled with it!  It is also important that baby can hold their head up by themself before using it as they lean way back to see toys hanging above them."
Baby,5.0,Best Monitor on the market,"This is the best monitor on the market hands down.  When my baby was first born I was very paranoid about him breathing. (LOL)  The monitor is so clear that I can hear every breath and see him in color (during the day) It has settings to play a lullaby or ocean sounds and has a night light feature (with different light colors).  You can also speak to your baby through the speaker option and take a picture via the app if his/her sleeping pose is just too adorable.  I love it, love it, love it!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,We were given these by our birthing hospital for our twins.  They have been with us from day one and will continue to be so until our children are weaned from them.  They provide the perfect combination of a pacifier and a toy.  It gives our babies something to hold on to and concentrate on while going down to sleep.  We love these guys and have given many of these as gifts over the past year or so.  I haven't had the first complaint from any recipients.  Clean-up is easy.... throw them in the washer and wash with hot water.  it's as easy as that.
Baby,5.0,Absolutely great,My daughter is only 4 months old and her feet do not reach the ground but we put some books underneath so she can bounce and she absolutely loves it. This thing keeps her busy for hrs. Wish it was cheaper though :(
Baby,5.0,Club Wubbanub,"I couldn't figure out why anyone would spend this much on a pacifier, so I skipped these with my first two kids. Baby #3 is addicted to soothies, but we couldn't keep track of them for the life of us. I decided to finally give Wubbanubs a shot and I'm a convert. TIt's so much easier to spot the thing with a lovey attached and when baby is tiny you can prop the stuffed animal on their chest and it helps keep the thing in their mouth, which is fantastic. Now that he is a bit older, he grabs the lovey and often pulls it out, but he spits the plain soothies out all the time anyways, so I think either way I'd be putting it back in all the time.<br /><br />Sidenote: we battled thrush for a while and I discovered that you can put these things in the microwave steam bags if you need to sterilize them. Sanity saver when you're sterilizing pacifiers daily to kill thrush."
Baby,5.0,Both my children enjoyed it!,"I love that you can use the mobile part of it with or without noise or light. My children really liked it. My boy would fall asleep with it, and my girl would enjoy watching it as a young baby, so it would buy me time when I needed to leave her in the crib for a few minutes."
Baby,5.0,awesome,"My son absolutely loves it. He was 4 months when used it for the first time. Great product,  well made"
Baby,5.0,Very Entertaining,"This keeps my 3 month old so entertained, he loves this toy. And I love that I can attach it to his play gym or his car seat. He even likes to hold it and put the giraffe's nose in his mouth. Definitely a good buy for babies!!"
Baby,5.0,absolutely love it,"i got this for my 4 months baby , and he loves it ... he keeps jumping and playing in it until he gets tired"
Baby,5.0,great product,My 5 month old loves it!! Its easy to put together. Enough toys to entertain him. I recommend it for your energizing bunny.
Baby,5.0,Easy to use,This product is easy to use and I love how I can use it anywhere. The video comes in over my iPhone.
Baby,5.0,Love!,"Works great.  The slight amount of weight helps keep it in his mouth, and now he likes holding onto the stuffed animal while he is sucking on the pacifier.  The only down side is trying to clean everything."
Baby,5.0,a proven winner.....,when deciding on a jumper for my grandson ....reviews came in handy as many I thought were ok soon to find had issues ....this one had GREAT reviews ...!!! and my grandson LOVES it ..!!! He can't stop smiling when placed inside...and the first smile came when he figured out he could jump ....and in no time figured out he could spin around and look at toys ....He is almost 6 months...and we are currently putting something under him so he can reach the ground .... this will get lots of use ...esp in the months to come .....I know its been out for a long while ....but proven the test of time ...to be a WINNER...!!!! purchased in 2014
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!,"Trust these reviews!  This is the best thing we've purchased for our baby girl!  She's almost 9 months now so we're buying it a little late, but it's by far the best toy we've bought.  She LOVES it and plays with all the toys."
Baby,4.0,So smart,Simple and sensible. For me its easier to pull wipes up and out. It lets you easily pull one at a time. I love it!
Baby,5.0,Cute,"My son will only use soothie pacifiers, and he loves that this one has a monkey.  The plush toy makes the pacifier easier to keep an eye on when we are out, so I like it too."
Baby,5.0,Love it! Fun and colorful,"We love it! Baby is still a bit young to fully enjoy, but she is certainly interested. We like the different interactions, nothing that will hit her head (like the fisher price jungle one), and feels solid. The colors are bright and fun and the chair seems to have good support! Glad we did a little research before we bought."
Baby,5.0,24 Hour accessibility on all my devices,"Given sufficient band width this is an excellent device.  I was even able to keep an eye on him as my husband look after him as i went round the shops in town ; )<br /><br />Works well, excellent service, highly recommended"
Baby,5.0,GREAT ADD ON TO YOUR STROLLER!,This is the best add on ever! I use it on my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller! Works great! And the price is right!
Baby,3.0,"GET THE SKIP HOP, FITS CITY VERSA",The material is not has good as the Skip Hop.  It's not neoprene which is why it's so cheap. The Skip Hop is larger which is better for larger strollers like the City Versa.<br /><br />The Diono is smaller and is better for smaller strollers like an umbrella stroller.  I wish I got the Skip Hop one instead for my City Versa.
Baby,4.0,Not sure what people are expecting!,"This item works great! We were hesitant to order this because of the negative reviews that this product has, but as of today we have had no issues with it.<br />- No drop outs<br />- The picture quality is great!"
Baby,5.0,worth it,"If you want about 30 min of rest even at the most trying time, get this and you will thank me for it."
Baby,1.0,Stupid me!,"I bought this unit recently despite the very low approval ratings because a friend said she had no problems. Stupid me! I cannot even get past the app software setup because the \\""I Accept\\"" link on the terms of use does not appear as a live link. So I can't complete the setup. I've removed and reinstalled the app to no avail. Basically it is not optimized for the most recent iPhone iOS. This is really BS and a huge waste of time. Have more respect for your customer please. I have sent a help ticket to their support desk which is run by zen desk. I have low hopes and I am prepared to pack this garbage up and return it. But I will give it two business days. And I will update u here. In the meantime if anyone else has seen this problem and has a workaround I would love to know it!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I got a response today that I need to sign up via the web at what is a very poor interface.  So I did that and then I went to my iPhone and logged in and started the set up process.  I entered the information on the \\""Baby's profile\\"", and now the \\""Next\\"" link at the bottom of that page is not live and I cannot move to the next page.<br />This is outrageous.  I don't believe this software is optimized for iOS 7.  I have sent another help request - we will see what comes of it but I'm not hopeful based on what I've already seen."
Baby,5.0,Would recommend.,"The mobile is so vibrant. Our baby loves the colors, the animals and especially the music. We just use the bottom music box now, but our baby still loves it just the same."
Baby,5.0,get it!,"Great. Our 4 month old loved it immediately and routinely falls asleep while bouncing. This had such great reviews and believe it or not is actually the least busy and obnoxious design out there. It is still quite obnoxious, but volume is low, controllable, and sounds and music are pleasant.<br />First week we had it a part broke and fisher price was excellent,  replacing the part overnight on a Saturday."
Baby,5.0,Good purchase.,Helpful to have on my umbrella stroller to keep my phone a keys handy.  A good and useful purchase. ..
Baby,5.0,My almost 4 month old loves this!,We put this together a couple of weeks ago which was easy by the way.  My son loves it and cannot get enough of it.  He is tall for his age but can already touch the floor at 3.5 months on the lowest setting.  I cannot get enough of watching him giggle and smile when he is in it.
Baby,5.0,"Easy to put together, little one loves it!","This was a very easy build out of the box, and our little one can't get enough of it. It really seems to help her hone those early motor skills."
Baby,5.0,baby joy,"my granddaughter spent many happy hours jumping around in her jumparoo.  it is big and takes up a good deal of space, but well worth the price and the size."
Baby,5.0,I love it...,My baby bounce herself to sleep... Great entertainment! Recommended for all parents with active babies. Love it love it love it
Baby,2.0,Baby Didn't Love...,"I bought these for my 2 month old to try. She didn't seem very thrilled with them. As a matter of fact, she hardly noticed them. I was not thrilled because they didn't fit very well. They were tight on the elastic ankle part but were very loose on her foot."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it,"I bought this when our son just turned 3.5 months old.  Initially it was too high for him, so we had to fold thick blanket under his feet to prop him up. He was a little on guard when we first put him in the seat. But it only took him a couple of days to get used to the jumping sensation and now at 4.5 months old, he is a pro jumper and he also loves to flip the toys. He is having a lot of fun on it.<br /><br />The only thing that I think can be improved a bit is the toys. Our son really like the side rattle that he can flip, but other toys are quite boring for him. We also hang a lot of other toys over his head, so that kind of spiced things up a bit for him.<br /><br />overall, it is a very good thing for babies. Highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,:),does what it's supposed to do.  son loves it.  helps him with his gerd and in regulating his feedings.  thank you very much.
Baby,3.0,meeh,"android app does not really work. crashes all the time and is not compatible with some common android devices (I have a HTC One and the app doesnt even show up in the app store). also, the mounting options arent great, I cant get a good enough picture mounting it at the end of the bed (cant get the whole crib in the frame) so its above his head which gives me an upside down picture. cant swivel or anything so side mount is not an option either. whats worse, it actually fell on my babies head today! didnt do anything besides scare the both of us but still!<br /><br />so since my android doesnt work i have to use my macbook where you dont get any of the options besides the video/sound. no interaction possible this way :( very disappointed given the high price"
Baby,3.0,"cool, but not for the diaper bag","I like this travel wipe case, but i si really too thick to be considered good for packing in a diaper bag. I think it's great to clip onto the stroller for when er are out and about and needing some hand or face wipes... But no so much for the diaper bag due to the bulk."
Baby,5.0,great item! and fast deleviery,I loved everything about this it was very fast shipping I ordered it and had it the next day its very cute I haven't used it yet not till july but im sure he will love it! I would recommend this to anyone!!thank youu
Baby,5.0,Best baby investment,My little guy just loves it! He is able to spin himself around and play with all of the different toys. I do have to watch my two year old because he can get a little carried away with bouncing his brother but it is definitely worth the investment. It also works as my babysitter while I make dinner. :)
Baby,5.0,Must buy!,This was the best product I ever bought! It's so with it! My five month old lives it! He's entertained for hours!!
Baby,5.0,Bought for 5 month old,"Baby cried the first three times she went in this. I thought I'd made a bad choice. On the fourth attempt she stayed in for twenty minutes each time then want out. Now (3 weeks later) she's jumping constantly, moving around and exploring all the toys. She giggles and screams with excitement all the time she's in it. Brilliant buy!"
Baby,5.0,This product is amazing!!,This is the single most important thing that we pack when we leave home with our Toddler. 17mos old as I write this review and still showing no signs of wanting to getting off of it....he just loves it and is his &#34;security blanket&#34;
Baby,5.0,perfect for my phil&ted buggy,This is perfect for my phil&ted buggy. I wish I could find this product earlier. It holds 2 bottles and phone and some changes. Very stable and well made. recommend it!
Baby,1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,"Not reliable. As soon as baby makes noise or moves, the app crashes. Ridiculous - Do not waste your money."
Baby,5.0,practical solution,"Wish these would come with the bottle, but they are a practical solution for storage without having to use the nipples."
Baby,5.0,These fit the natural bottles,I was hesitant to get these because some said they did not fit the newer Avent bottles.  They fit mine perfectly.  Great storage system in general.  Can go from freezer to fridge to wherever easily without wasting milk.
Baby,5.0,Keeps little ones attention,"I give this five stars because it's the only jumper that could keep my son occupied. Not only was it fairly easy for him to jump in, it has bright colors, lots of fun toys and so easy to assemble. I would highly recommend this jumper to anyone!"
Baby,5.0,great investment.,My 4 month old loves this jumper! It is strong and looks safe. My only dislike is it is big and  hard to move.
Baby,5.0,thanks,"the toy is adorable and I am sure the baby will love it, also it arrived quickly and was well packaged, no problems what so ever."
Baby,5.0,Fits well. No leaks.,I use these with the Natural bottles and have had no issues with leakage so far. There is no reason to buy Classic bottle lids to use these.
Baby,5.0,Fabulous concept,We bought this toy per recommendations from my friends and reviews on amazon and we are glad we bought it. Our little one loves jumping and spending time on jumperoo.
Baby,5.0,Surprisingly useful,"My friend bought one of these for my baby because her daughter loves it.  At first, I thought it was just a gimic and wouldn't be used much, but my one year old brings them everywhere he goes.<br /><br />After using it and regular pacifiers for a few weeks, we ended up only using the Wubbanubs.  My son was able to manipulate them to get them into his mouth at a very young age but had a harder time with regular pacifiers.  He would also drop the regular pacifiers but the fact that the animal is attached makes it harder to lose these. If you place it on top of baby's tummy when he (or she) is in his car seat, he can actually find it himself.  It stays there whereas a regular pacifier would drop to the side.<br /><br />We bought three different animals after the first one but my son's favorites are the monkey and the puppy.  He even tried to use both the monkey and puppy at the same time on a couple of occasions because he loves them so much."
Baby,5.0,GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS IS MY SECOND ONE.  THE FIRST ONE MY KIDS OUT GREW AND I GAVE TO GOODWILL.  THE SECOND ONE I BOUGHT BECAUSE, WAIT FOR IT, I HAD ANOTHER KID AND HE LOVES IT AS WELL AS THE OTHER 2 DID."
Baby,4.0,Great! But one complaint.,"I bought this for my 3 month old because he is developmentally ahead of schedule with head control and sitting up. He was getting easily bored and needed something upright to entertain him and to work on other skills. I researched jumperoos and exercausers for  days and finally bought this one. Overall, I'm happy with it. Even though he is too short for it, he still fits in the seat and can reach some of the toys (we just put books under his feet). I love the music (it's not overly obnoxious) and I love the variety of toys to keep his attention. He LOVES it.<br /><br />Here's my one complaint: I am VERY disappointed with the 360 degree seat. It really doesn't rotate easily. If I'm having a hard time spinning it, it will be impossible for my son. I'm hoping it will loosen up a bit, which is why I didn't return it, and he loves it so much, but I wish it spun better. We've tried soaping it up, we've double checked the cloth to make sure it wasn't getting stuck, and tried to wear in the wheels. Nothing worked. Sigh."
Baby,1.0,Beyond frustrating,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this product to anyone.  Those of you who are lucky enough to have this product function like it's supposed to...are lucky.<br /><br />I've been using this monitor for about 3 months now, and it's been an absolute mess.  We had absolutely no problems setting it up on any of our devices (iPhone 4s, 5s, and iPad Air), but that was the extent of easiness we've experienced.<br /><br />Straight up--This monitor doesn't monitor.  All day and night, it's constantly connecting/reconnecting.  I rarely see actual video of my baby in her crib.  It's always a still frame of her that was pulled from whenever it last connected.  Through the night, I'm woken up off and on by the horrific sound of the notifier telling me that my connection has been lost and cannot be found...and it SHUTS DOWN THE APP COMPLETELY.  While I'm sleeping.  And I wake up to silence.  No monitoring sound or video--Just silence--as it's reconnecting.  It's infuriating.<br /><br />The entire POINT of a baby monitor is to let you know if your baby needs you.  And this monitor doesn't do that.  Sometimes it acts possessed.  On occasion it DOES work, and when I had notifiers turned on for noise or movement in the baby's room, it would sound the notifier for EVERYTHING, no matter how much I messed with the thresholds.  Now?  They don't even work because for some reason, it just can't stay connected.  I've power cycled and removed the battery and done everything too many times to count to get it working like it's supposed to.<br /><br />And now, the app crashes with any notification due to the recent iOS update.<br /><br />The app hasn't been updated since October 2013, and it needs a TON of work.  The thresholds for temperature and humidity reset themselves constantly, and it appears that my connection problems might be related as well.  I don't have any issues with any of my other wireless devices in our house-Just this one.  Sometimes it will pull up the video feed, and there will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.  The supposed bluetooth connection is non-existent.  It will connect when you first connect it, and then it just shuts off completely.  I've never seen it actually connect and monitor using the bluetooth connection.<br /><br />Bottom line?  You want a baby monitor to monitor your baby.  And this product just doesn't do that very often.  It will cause you more frustration and headache than the bells and whistles are worth.  If it worked correctly, this monitor would be amazing, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm about to go buy another monitor.  Ugh.  Please don't waste your money on this.ere will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.

Baby,4.0,Not bad,First box we got the remote was not working so had to return it. But the replacement we got is working fine. The peek a boo isnt really a peek a boo.. doesnt hide the dolls or anything. the leaf just flaps in and out slowly. I do like the music. Some others complained the music is too quiet but it's perfect. We got this for our 2 month old and he really enjoyed watching it since them and he is 5 months now and loves talking to the dolls and watch the light on the side panel.<br />For $36 I would recommend it.
Baby,5.0,very handy,"i use this with my son's mountain buggy and mia moda stroller. great for parents drinks, keys, cell phones, bottles, snacks....for me it was a must to own :-)"
Baby,5.0,Using this for years,"I added this to my Citi Mini and so happy with it - still running after all the time and works great. Fits most bottles, has a secret zipper storage area and very satisfied!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent,We bought this because our 6 month old baby loved using it in daycare. It is excellent and would have no hesitation in recomending it. It is used in day care and is used all day everyday by babies and stands up to this without breaking or showing wear or tear.
Baby,5.0,Jungle play,Our grand baby will play in this for about 30 minutes before she gets tired. She isn't tall enough to reach the floor yet but we believe that once she gets a little bigger she will enjoy it more.
Baby,1.0,Piece of junk,"This is a terrible monitor. It cuts out all the time and has to be rebooted. I spend half the time while my baby is napping rebooting this product. DO NOT BUY THIS! In addition, we are on our second one. Luckily the first one broke within a matter of days but I was hoping it was just a faulty unit. Not the case; it is a faulty product. Keep looking. We've used it with Mac and android."
Baby,3.0,Baby didn't like it,"We were anticipating this bouncer so much as our baby kept bouncing all on our laps. We've had this bouncer for 10 days and have put baby in it several times per day each day and we bounce her up/down in it but she simply doesn't like being stationary. She's a very mobile baby and as much as we wanted her to love this, she would only cry/whine to get out of it. It seems like a fun toy. She seems to like the music but then remembers she can't move about. Her left arm had great potential to get stuck in the front part of the toy if she were to turn but she never stayed in long enough for that to happen. It was easy enough to assemble. She was also to short for it on the lowest setting and she's about 24.5 inches tall, we put a pillow under her feet. She's 5 months old and the best purchase we've made lately is a walker instead..."
Baby,5.0,very well constructed,I bought these for my newborn grandson and we alternated putting them on his wrist and ankle.  He wasn't very aware of them but when he realized they were there he was very interested.
Baby,2.0,Not worth the Money,"We received this as a baby gift, I was so excited. When I went to set it up, there is no crib strap so I had to make a shelf next to the crib for it. Thus being said, I still can not see a full clear view of the crib. I still go check on the baby every 10 minutes because I can not see her.<br />The night vision is so blurry, I was hoping for $300 dollars the quality would be very clear and crisp. It slowly gets worse then I have to adjust the screen a little for the clearer view (which is still blurry).<br />The color hardly ever works, when it does the monitor does come through clearer.<br />The sound is good, I can hear everything, I do like all the features.<br />I don't like how I lose connection to it randomly. (and all my other wireless systems are still working fine.)<br />I have not been able to adjust the temp range properly.<br />Oh and did I mention you better by a battery charger because it will drain your phone battery quickly?<br /><br />Over all I really wanted this to work, I loved the idea, but I felt so disappointed from a $300 unit.<br />I could have saved someone money by getting a $200 digital once form the baby store.<br />My cousin's works better than mine, and it does not kill your phone battery."
Baby,4.0,Baby enjoys playtime in her jumperoo.,My daughter loves that she can spin around in the seat all by herself. She likes the animals sounds and the bright colors.
Baby,5.0,baby loved it,7month old baby girl loves to jump and loves this jumper-only issue is ability to clean the front where she &#34;spits&#34;<br />otherwise she plays alot!!!
Baby,5.0,Well made,Very well made and safe. My 7 month old grandchild likes it sometimes but really loves the one her parents have (a fisher price they inherited). Have always found Fisher-Price products to be excellent and always look at their products first.
Baby,5.0,Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it! The best ever.<br />It is adjustable, takes up a small footprint, colorful and fun."
Baby,5.0,Soft,Soft for the babies to play with and it is very light.  Easy to hang as well.  would buy different animal as well.
Baby,3.0,Worked Great - at first,"I cannot access the camera from my phone without a wi-fi connection anymore. I haven't called tech support or anything about this - I'm busy. But for the inconvenience, I took off a few stars.<br /><br />Before, when it worked, it was AWESOME!! I could see my baby, my dog, my mother-in-law all day, take snapshots, hear them, etc. The picture isn't very clear, but it serves its purpose - a great spying tool. :-)"
Baby,5.0,wow,my daughter LOVES this thing... best investment i have made in toys thus far. she cant get enough of it
Baby,5.0,Great product!,Easy to put together and my baby loves it!  This is one of the best things she has gotten because it is giving her exercise and strengthing her core.  It is also improving her coordination and dexterity.
Baby,4.0,I like it!!!,"This one is really cutie.  It works as described on the web.  Just one thing, the snaps are not really tight as it usually falls down every time I fold my stroller.  But overall, its good and very convenient for emergency :-)"
Baby,4.0,Cute and cuddly,"A very cute product. My son has jaw muscle issues which makes sucking difficult. I ordered this when he was 4 weeks old to help him keep his pass in and help with sucking. I don't think it really helped as much as I hoped, however now at two months old he touches the soft monkey and pulls at it to try ang get pass back in mouth. If nothing else it is adorable, it keeps the falling pass from doing the dreaded floor bounce roll disappear, and it helps us keep his pass separate from our 20 month olds."
Baby,4.0,Loads of fun but limited life span of toy,"It was very entertaining for my little one. We got it when he was 6-7 months old and it kept him busy for a while but at 10-11 months, he decided he didn't want to get in anymore. He wasn't even crawling by then, so not sure what turned him off. I loved it but wished we had gotten more bang for our buck."
Baby,5.0,Well wroth the price,Excellent product. Easy to install and use. This monitor works so well you can hear your baby breathing. This was well worth the price.
Baby,5.0,Great organizer for a great price,"We bought a Britax stroller but I didnt want to pay 30 bucks for the Britax stroller organizer. Was a bit skeptical of this one at first, but when it arrived was pleasantly surprised! Sturdy and enough room for everything. Very happy! Works well."
Baby,5.0,Great toy,My 3 month old daughter loves it and the velcro makes it easy to move and attach to her seat or stroller.
Baby,5.0,Spent a lot of time picking this out...Glad I did my research!,"This jumper has been awesome. Sturdy, fun, safe...my daughter loved it at 6 months and still loves it at 8 months. The height can be adjusted, the sound frequency and volume can be adjusted or turned off, and the head rest is a nice addition for younger babies. It took me 10 minutes to put it together. I highly recommend it!"
Baby,3.0,its ok,I got it hoping the monkey was kinda heavy cause my son has trouble holding his pacifier in his mouth. Hoping money would help it cause of weight but monkey is small and very light. If I push monkey up more on his chest it helps a little. I just wish you can take it off monkey to wash It right. I just used a baby wipe to wipe down monkey. The passy I just wash in sink but monkey gets all wet. This item def not going out in public cause id wash the monkey everyday lol. Im wondering if its safe to throw in dish washer when needed?
Baby,5.0,Love this Jumper!,"I read the reviews and they were spot on.The jumper is great and my LO loves it. He plays from 5 minutes to 30 minutes at a time. I like the activity areas, the music etc. I am glad I did my research on this before buying. I got it when he turned 4.5 months and was just holding his head up and he still enjoys it quite a bit at 6 months plus now. Like to place this in an area he can look around and be interactive. Very good buy, highly recommended!"
Baby,3.0,"Good, but.....","This is a really nice baby monitor, especially if you like gadgets. It is very easy to set up with iphone or android and works well. You get  a clear image of your baby and the sound is really good. What you need to consider though, before you choose to buy this, is that it works on wifi. So if you're wifi connection is bad, so will the connection between your phone and baby monitor be. This is of course not whitings fault, but it is important to take into consideration. What I am really unsatisfied about, is the battery life. If you  need to use the baby monitor outside the house, the battery will be empty within an hour, even if you close the monitor so it only sends sound and no image."
Baby,4.0,Good purchase,"Like the purchase, as it was a trusted companion to our little girl, as the gears or something star to wear down and not spin around like it use to after about 6-7 months...  Not batteries as they have been replaced..."
Baby,5.0,Love!,This is such a cute toy!! So many different effects to keep a baby entertained! I definitely recommend buying this toy!!!
Baby,5.0,Cute little toy keeps baby interested,My baby loves her little giraffe. She immediately preferred this toy out of the other ones I bought her. I can't wait for her to play with it more and more as she grows. (She's currently 3 1/2 months)
Baby,5.0,Better quality and cheaper!,We were about to spend $30 for a &#34;brand&#34; stroller organizer.  I was glad when we found this.  It is better quality and was much more affordable.  It holds 2 cups easily and has enough room for a phone and other small items in the middle.  The velcro holds well.  I would definitely purchase it again.
Baby,4.0,Good Jumper,This is a lot of fun for my 5 month old but it's still too tall for him. I just put books under his feet though. My only complaint is that the bug teether has a floppy stand not upright as it shows in the picture.
Baby,5.0,love this product!,my 4 month old had problems holding in pacifier during sleeping and we had to get up multiple times during the night to put pactifier in...this product stays in much better than a regular pactifier and she loves it! it puts her right to sleep...and now she can put it in herself!
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT,My son loves this. Now that he is 6 months he plays with it in the car or when in the stroller
Baby,5.0,Go with this if you have a tall baby!!!,"Our son has regularly been in the 90-97th percentile for height since his 4 month check up.  If you are the parent of a tall kid, go with this.  After much research, I'm pretty sure it gives the best height range.<br /><br />This jumper is so much fun.  Tons to do, tons to see, and it doesn't seem to get old...the songs don't even get on your nerves when you see how much fun your kid is having bouncing around. :)"
Baby,5.0,"great idea, wish I had thought of it first","bought it for my niece and she's addicted, even if only to hold. Great for parents because you don't have to worry as much about the kids spitting out the pacifier and losing it to the ground. Was easy for me to reach back and give it back to my kids and then they learned to reach for it themselves."
Baby,3.0,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"My baby loves the Jumperoo! I started putting him in it since he was 3 months old. Now he is 6 months and he is at the level 2 height. There are 3 levels. He can play in it until he falls asleep, and it had happened a few times. So when I put him in there, I can finish house work, do laundry and cooking without him crying. However, the reason for giving it only 3 stars is because the music is broken! Every time the baby jumps, the music restart. sometimes, there is no music at all and sometimes a white noise-like sounds appears."
Baby,5.0,A Horse of Course,What's not to love?  It's a cute horse with silly feet and a mohawk.  Lamaze toys are great.  High quality and durable.
Baby,5.0,Great sensory toy!,"Bought for my cousins baby. He loves it lots. The giraffes crinkly tummy is his favorite, but he also loves the mirror.  As a precaution, I had his father glue the mirror in so that it wouldn't fall out.  Great product. Would definitely recommend"
Baby,5.0,"Yes buy this, you will thank me","My husband and I joke that this was the best investment we made for our daughter. We purchased the Jumperoo when our daughter was a little over three months. She didn't reach the floor at first, so we put books under her feet so she could reach. She was into all the animals figurines right away. She is now 8 months old and still plays in it every day. Great baby investment!"
Baby,5.0,monkey toy pacifier,cute idea!  Mommy & Daddy-to-be were impressed with it and goes well the theme & décor of baby's room! Fast delivery and in good shape-was here in plenty of time for shower!
Baby,5.0,Love it! Durable,Love it! Had mine for 5 years and now bought one for my sister! Lasts forever!  Very good indeed!! Buy it
Baby,5.0,LOVE THIS,My sister recommended this because I had no where to hold a drink on my stroller. It lasted 4 years before it fell apart and I bought a new one - Id say that was a grey deal for the money. It might have lasted longer but my son pulled it off the stroller and it got left outside in bad weather.
Baby,2.0,Don't waste your money,Hot glue a pacifier to any small light weight stuffed animal and you have the same thing only a whole lot cheaper ! Is much to light weight to help keep it in their mouth. Lets just say &#34;they saw me coming&#34;  LOL
Baby,5.0,Worth every penny.,"Wouldn't know how to live without this little jewel, its perfect for what I was looking for, and definitely helps me keep track of my little one while sleeping."
Baby,4.0,"Crazy loud, crazy awesome","Great exercise, great occupier, but crazy loud (the actual jumper, not the music).  We got this jumper for our five-month-old (now almost seven mos) daughter, and she LOVES it.  She actually falls asleep in this thing, we can barely get her out of it.  She has always been a strong baby so she wanted to be in this thing (they have one at her school as well) since she could barely touch the ground while in it.  It has been great for building her leg muscles and she becomes more and more interested in all the activities that the jumper has to offer, and compared to lots of baby toys, the music for this thing isn't the most annoying (although you will get the songs stuck in your head, guaranteed!).  My only complaint (and really it's a small one) is that the jumper itself is extremely loud.  I'm talking about when my daughter is in it and jumping, it sounds like a giant plastic rattle, or a plastic thunderstorm.  In other words, don't try to listen to or watch anything attentively when they're in that thing, Not that that's such a bad thing."
Baby,5.0,Fun!,My 4 month old has a blast in this. I'm so glad we got this one! The only issue is that he isn't quite tall enough for his feet to fully reach the floor so we just put a heavy book down for him to jump on. I'm glad he has room to grow into it though. I think it will be a favorite as he gets more independent in his playing. It is sturdy but easy to break down if you need to move it or put it away.
Baby,5.0,A Must-have Product!!,"This Jumperoo is a lifesaver, our daughter absolutely loves it! She can easily turn herself in the seat to play with everything it has to offer. I looked at about a million reviews of different Jumperoos before we purchased this one & I'm glad I did my homework because this one is the best! Our daughter is short, she's 23 inches at 5 months old so the lowest setting still doesn't let her reach the floor but we put a pillow under her & she jumps nonstop. Without this product I wouldn't be able to get anything done around the house!"
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I had expected.,"I researched all of the jumperoo style toys.  After hours of research, I ended up deciding on this one.  It is exactly what I had expected it to be.  Everything functions properly and have had no problems so far.  Money well spent."
Baby,5.0,LOVE,We love our wubs! I have recommended to many friends.  If your baby uses a soothie pacifier these are great!  My baby has three and the monkey is BY FAR his favorite.  Tip--throw it in the washing machine with the loads and loads of laundry you are now doing and then air dry and it's good to go!
Baby,5.0,Love it!!!,I bought this jumperoo for my 4 month old son.  He LOVES it!  He gets so excited when he sees he gets to go in it.  He jumps like crazy and will stay in it 20 minutes plus! I enjoy the music.  Best baby toy purchase yet!
Baby,4.0,my baby loves it so i'm happy.,"First time mom here. My baby is 3 months old. I bought this knowing it would be too big for him (but it was on sale). He has become bored with sitting in his bouncer and laying on playmat. He actually fit well into the seat and was able to jump once I put a pillow under his feet. There is plenty of room in the seat for him to grow into. It's not too big that he slips out. He enjoys the lights and noises/songs. They (thankfully) shut off on their own and only restart with movement. He is able to turn them on with his jumping. He even enjoys the two things that hang down. He is still too small to reach the various toys. I'm sure I will be using this for awhile.<br /><br />A little difficult to transport so I will be being another one to keep at grandma's house.<br /><br />Pros: lots of toys to keep him entertained. sturdy base, no fear of tipping over. easy instructions. easy dismantling for transport to grandma's.<br />Cons: the pieces don't fold very small, making transport a little cumbersome."
Baby,5.0,Very good stroller organizer,"I have an Uppababy Cruz and it doesn't have a cup holder. I was initially looking for a cup holder and wasn't happy with the selection. Then I noticed the Diono stroller organizer and decided to give it a go. I wasn't sure if it would fit the Cruz, but seeing how it has velcro holders on either side, I thought it might work out and it did. The velcro makes it an adjustable fit and it worked out great for me. It has two cup holders on either side and a middle compartment that you can put whatever else in. The middle compartment also has a zipper pocket. I normally put a bottle of water for myself in one of the cup holders and keep my phone in the other one. The cup holders are deep, so once you put a bottle/cup or two in there, the organizer feels very stable.<br /><br />All in all, pretty good stroller organizer, especially for the price!"
Baby,4.0,Good toy for my girl,"My 3 months little girl likes them, she always rise her hand watch them, then she sucked. The bright color can catch her eyes . Only thing I complain, the band are kind of short for her fat writs."
Baby,3.0,Unable to replace pacifier,"This is a great product, but be aware that the pacifier is attached to the stuffed animal, and cannot be replaced."
Baby,5.0,Universal fit,"I got this to add to my City Mini GT stroller, and it fits perfectly (and is much cheaper than the Baby Jogger brand console!). It is made of a flexible material, so it doesn't cause any problems when the stroller is folded."
Baby,5.0,Holds my Starbucks!,"I know that a lot of these cup holder attachments can hold water bottles, but what about Starbucks cups or other travel cups that aren't closed tightly? This one works! When you position it properly on the handlebar, you should be able to put a travel coffee cup in it without spilling it all over. While I do recommend using those little green sticks to keep it from splashing, at least I know it won't tip over! Some of these things just don't feel secure enough on the handlebar for me to risk putting hot liquids in them. This one is secure as long as you tighten it enough.<br /><br />Also, there is a lot of room for other goodies in between the two cups, as well as a zipper pocket. I keep things in there that I'm going to leave in the holder so that I can fold the stroller without taking it off and my stuff won't fall out. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a stroller attachment."
Baby,2.0,Grumpy father without his baby monitor,"Unfortunately I'm changing my rating from a 4-star to a 2-star. Originally 4-stars were given based on the product not working with Android (the 5 different devices we have in our household) even though Withings states that it should work on all versions of Android. I should note that I have devices with the latest version of Android ranging to a few releases older than the newest hotness. To get the Baby Monitor to function I re-purposed an iPod Touch. Apple support for their mobile app seems to be great .. I understand nailing a working Android app is difficult given the multiple version of Android, the matrix of hardware, as well as carrier crapware .. still you pay premium for a Baby Monitor it should just work. Calls to support yielded &#34;we're sorry, not much we can do.&#34;<br /><br />I'm updating to 2-star due to the lack of support on a premium product. Last week the monitor disconnected from our wifi network and I've been unable to get it to reconnect nor a hard reset resets the Monitor to a state where bluetooth enabled devices can see it. This is unfortunate because Amazon's warranty just ran out. Working with Withings support has been unhelpful.<br /><br />The staff have walked me through debugging the device using support documents that I already discovered and tried before pinging them (you can google the docs). Each email exchange takes +24 hours or more. This is unhelpful at best and frustrating to say the least, having a support email consist of &#34;does the blue light still blink after you do ...&#34; and then not responding for a few days makes a process that should be somewhat straightforward not. A simple live chat feature or phone call would likely solve the problem quickly letting me know if the device is dead or in their wizardary it can be resolved.<br /><br />Having a new born and no baby monitor should be viewed as a sev-1 by any support team."
Baby,5.0,Love!,Both of my grandbabies born two days apart love this. Keeps them busy for a long time. Would definitely recommend.
Baby,4.0,Avent Bottle Sealing Discs,These were a baby shower gift along with a Avent Bottle Set. They were recommended by three different mothers which is why I purchased them.
Baby,4.0,nice toy,my baby boy enjoy t a lot the feel in his hand teeth really nice when you have ur baby in a stroller and he is so handfull
Baby,5.0,Works wonderfully with the natural bottles and more!,"Love these discs -- they are hard plastic and snap into the natural bottle collar like a gem.  Once tightened on the bottle, there is no leak and the bottle looks pretty nice.  I fill 8oz glass natural bottles with water for convenient formula making by the bedside.  This is a necessary item if you use the avent bottles.  I can see how the 4oz bottles can become snack/food jars once the baby is older.<br /><br />Also, these discs come with a clear plastic container that can hold 10 discs comfortably.  There's one container per package of 6.  I really like the container -- simple but pretty nifty and can hold the discs without loosening.<br /><br />Will buy again and definitely recommend these."
Baby,4.0,Nice and bright,"I loved the bright colors and the fact it came sealed in a clear plastic bag. I sent it off with my other baby gifts, to the expectant parents, never noticing that on this one they only put 3 of the legs!  Turned out the parents like the quirkiness of that, and won't give it up to be returned, Lol. Now I know that amazon and the toy maker would make this right, so this really would be a five star rating, but I left one star off, like the one leg that was missing! ;-)"
Baby,2.0,"Nice case, but cover is an issue","Instructions say the red cover closes and give it a push for a &#34;soft click.&#34;  That does happen, but with any contact with another object, the red top cover slides back open.  Have to be really careful to not let the  wipes dry  out.  Would not rec. it."
Baby,5.0,so much fun!,"We love this! We bought it when our son was 5 months old, he was so little but had really good control of his head so he jumped in this twice daily for 45 minutes each! He was so cute jumping! He is 11 months old and still loves jumping in it. He was pulling up on furniture and walking around at 9 1/2 months so I dont feel like he was in it too much. I know every baby is different, but if they love it then there really isnt too much time spent in it and babies are only little once. Also, It is very easy to clean ( Clorox wipe the hard plastic and machine wash everything else) and is VERY entertaining.  I wish I had bought this for my 4 year old son when he was that little, I had the door jumper and I was so scared that it would fall and he would get hurt so he didn't really use it. This jumperoo is well built and sturdy. The toys that come with it are cute. The cons about this are minor, there is only one or two songs and it gets pretty annoying, I had to take the batteries out for a week to have peace and quiet, then i felt bad so I put them back in. It can get pretty loud when he jumps, but that is with any jumperoo or exersaucer. I will say that this is quieter than his exersaucer. I think the price is fair, although for some families it might be alot for a toy used for a few months. It is definitely worth it,  my son loves it. I feel confident that he is safe while using this and would recommend this."
Baby,5.0,My Kid Loves It,"Straightforward product at a good price. As always Amazon delivers quickly. No other jumper products to compare to, but no qualms about this one!<br /><br />-ace"
Baby,5.0,Lots of color and excitement....my lil guy loves it,My son is just 3 months and loves to grab and hear the feet crinkle....its a great piece. thank you
Baby,2.0,"Worked hard to make this good, but it just doesn't meet expectations","I really liked the idea of having a way to view our baby quickly on our phone without having to walk into their room and interrupt them.  I chose this over dropcam because the notifications are in 5 minute intervals, where dropcam's was every 30 minutes which just isn't enough if you have a crying baby.<br /><br />Some things that were hard about setting it up is if you expect to use wi-fi with it, you better make sure your router is close to it in the house.  The only way we could get it to be reasonably reliable is have our router in our room (the baby room is next to ours).  Forget it if it's across the house.<br /><br />The app for iPhone would receive a 1 star rating.  It consistently crashes, the settings are unreliable (noise, motion, temperature, and humidity alerts), and overall it just is buggy.  The only alert that we have turned on is noise, because all the others settings got out of whack and wouldn't work.  Don't even expect to log on to the internet to see a view from the browser at the webcam.  They must have hired some of Obama's web developers for that because it doesn't work at all.  I've maybe got it to come up twice.<br /><br />The stuff I like about it is it has a night light, music, ability to talk from your phone to the unit and out the speaker, and the video quality during the day isn't bad.  Overall, if I could go back to the day I bought it, I probably wouldn't and I'd look into other options."
Baby,4.0,high quality basic organizer,i am pleased with this stroller caddy.  it is high quality for the cost of it.  it secures to two handles with velcro tabs.  i put it on my city mini stroller and it fit perfectly.
Baby,5.0,excellent,"just perfect for any stroller, very well made, it looks like it was manufactured with my stroller, and received it within 3 days!"
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT!!!,When I saw the price of this I thought that seems like a waste of money!! But no I swear it's probably the best $15 I have ever spent!!! My son loves it. I just wish you could replace the binkie on or or at least take it off for washing
Baby,5.0,developement toy,I purchased as a gift but really liked the toy. The colors were bright and the&#34; sounds&#34; it made were exactly what I wanted for a 4 month old.
Baby,4.0,Fits well,I have the Uppa baby Cruz and it fits very well. The only problem I do have is when the seat is facing forward; it gets in the way and it doesn't recline.
Baby,5.0,gift,"gift was well liked by the receiving party from what I was told, the only drawback was I could not find the gift notecard option on Amazon check out."
Baby,3.0,Cute but baby wasn't amused.,I am writing this review based on how my baby found it as it seems. Wasn't amused or entertained by it. It would have been nice if it held his attention since the colors and designs were cute.
Baby,4.0,great product and works like a charm,"if it wasn't for the somehow complicated setup and the lack of proper non-IOS interface, this product would get 5 stars.<br />Still love it and i think its a must for any family with a new born."
Baby,5.0,my 6 week old HOLDS IT!,Got this when my son was 6 weeks and he was able to hold on to it bc he likes to hold onto something while he sleeps. I was really getting aggravated when he would wake up wanting his paci and it would be dark so i couldn't find it and it was constantly falling out of his mouth. with this if i swaddle him he can't push it away from his mouth. and he was already sucking soothies so whoever came up with this idea is genius. And i love that you can just stick it in the washing machine.
Baby,3.0,The leg holes are too small :-(,"My baby is 5 months old and in the 75% percentile for size for his age group. The leg holes on this jumperoo are so small that I can barely cram his legs into them, even though he only weighs 19 lbs. When I lift him out of the jumperoo, it is difficult because he legs want to stay in there, and the entire fabric seating section gets inverted in order to pull him out. This jumperoo is suitable for infants who have good head control but cannot stand on their own yet. Unfortunately, because my son already barely fits into the leg holes, I think we will only get a month of use out of this thing before he is too big for it :-(."
Baby,5.0,My son LOVES this!,"Its perfect! my son loves to play with every attachment. He is a pretty serious bouncer and this holds very well. It offers a head support that he likes to lay and rest his head on. Love that you can adjust the length. Cute, fun music with it. East to put together. Great price!"
Baby,5.0,great buy,My daughter was 4 months when I got her this and she loves it. . .the music is entertaining to get and she loves bouncing around
Baby,5.0,Works good,"Bought the stroller organizer to use with our umbrella stroller.  The organizer is easy to attach to the handles via velcro straps and pretty much stays put.  The two cup/bottle holders work well and hold your drinks securely.  There is a small mesh zippered pocket inside between the two cup holder, good for holding small items such as spare change.  The organizer is well made and should hold up well to regular use."
Baby,5.0,Must purchase!!!,Best. Invention. Ever. The plush animal keeps it in my baby's mouth and she rubbs it with her fingers. Must purchase
Baby,2.0,useless android app makes monitor useless too,"Using the monitor online is fine most of the time and we don't have problems with it not loading. Trying to use it using the android app (which is what we use the majority of the time) is impossible though. It never loads reliably, some times not loading for hours at a time, sometimes loading after re-trying 10 times including shutting down all apps on phone and/or restarting phone.<br />All the other features (lights/music/microphone) are pointless. Our baby just freaks out from it."
Baby,4.0,Easy to setup and she enjoys it but only for about 20 minutes at a time,Our baby girl seems to really enjoy this item however she gets bored after about 20 minutes.<br /><br />It is however nice to give her something else to do for 20 minutes aside from playing on the floor and or in her play pen.<br /><br />She seems to really enjoy bouncing and working her legs and it does have really good bounce to it!  The items to play with don't really interest her that much anymore so we give her toys to play with in addition to the ones that are on the bouncer. She seems to just enjoy the bouncing motion more then anything.
Baby,5.0,Give it a week or so...,"We tried this with our son when he started holding his head up well at around 5 months. He didn't quite seem to know how to feel about it the first few times we put him in and would only remain for a few minutes. After a couple of weeks, however, he became comfortable with the thing and now he can't get enough of it, interacting with each and every one of the toys. Our advice: If your child doesn't warm up to the jumperoo right off the bat, give him/her a week or two to get acquainted with it before you give up on it. My wife and I also like how this jumperoo folds up for storage unlike other, bulkier options, and we both like that there are volume options as well as options for more sound, less sound, or no sound. Others have commented that the saucer is somewhat difficult to maneuver. It is, so you'll likely have to twist your child around yourself in order for him/her to access all the different toys. I wouldn't list this as a con, though, since I wouldn't want an easily spinning saucer (like one with wheels on a track) to be coupled with springs/bouncing. It seems like that much movement could get a little out of control for babies who are still learning to stabilize their necks."
Baby,5.0,Must have for newborns,"It greatly lessens the 'pop the pacifer back in' every 5 seconds for very young babies.<br />Plus, it stops the 'pacifer bounced and rolled across the floor' which seemed to happen every 10 seconds.<br />We loved the soothie type pacifer but we had bought many of them because they were always bouncing out and about and ending up under the beds, furniture, seats in the car--you name it.  This little monkey stopped that.<br />Plus it's very cute and our baby liked it.  I think it helped him learn to grab and pick things up.<br />Our monkey was well made and survived many trips through the washer."
Baby,5.0,"A delightful friend, but a bad influence?","My daughter ADORES her monkey wubbanub. She asks for it by name. She has a special laugh for it. If I would allow her to have it 24-7, it would only leave her mouth long enough for her to eat.<br /><br />However, I am concerned about the wubbanub monkey being a bad influence. We were travelling through an airport and as my daughter and I were getting ready to walk through the metal detector, a TSA agent informed me that she needed to x-ray and inspect the wubbanub monkey. I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine. My daughter still loves her monkey, but I can't look at him the same anymore. I hope that by giving him lots of love, we can deter him from his path of potential terrorism."
Baby,5.0,Great buy,"This is one of the best investments I've made. It works perfectly and I can tell it will fit any type of storller with adjustable velcro straps. I use with Joovy Caboose and I really enjoy using it. You can put 2 drinks and still room for phone, change, keys, etc. Very convenient and I am glad I found this."
Baby,4.0,City Select Double,"I am using this with the City Select double. Right now I have a bassinet attachment on the back. It is working now, but do not think it will be realistic if the child is ever sitting rear facing in the upper seat. They will do nothing but kick it and knock whatever drink you have in it. For the price of this product compared to others, it is good and will serve its purpose most of the time."
Baby,5.0,Great product !,"My son loves this ! He isn't entertained very long ,, but with this , he bounces and plays for a long time. He gets excercise and he's having fun. I highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"This is awesome!  Perfect for a cocktail or water bottle, pacifier and keys while taking a walk around the neighborhood!  #happymommy"
Baby,5.0,Great Product,I bought one of these for my nursing nephew not knowing if he will be taking a pacifier.  HE LOVES IT!  They are all so cute.  It's hard to pick just one.
Baby,4.0,Never buy a stroller without a cup holder,"I'll never make that mistake again.  I was a little disappointed with this stopgap solution, but my wife loves it, and that's what counts.  Caution - if your stroller's handles curve inward (such as a MacLaren) the handles will interfere with this product's cup holders.  Still usable, but awkward."
Baby,5.0,Not your ordinary play mat!,"This isn't any ordinary play mat because it converts as your baby grows. It's perfect for all stages and is great for newborn, active discovery, tummy time, sitting and crawling. It also can keep out pets and... little brothers!!<br /><br />After having four kids, I've learned a lot about baby products and find myself attracted to the most practical ones, and this in my mind is very practical. Being able to grow with my baby during all of her stages, as well as having the feature to remove the toys and music maker to use them elsewhere is extremely clever. There are so many ways to use this play mat, it's great!<br /><br />Lastly, it was very easy to put together, I had my five year old help me and she pretty much put it together herself."
Baby,4.0,Was just what I needed.,"This product works great. I can put my phone, drink and other items into the holder. I wish it came with two drink holders though."
Baby,5.0,My 4 month old LOVES this!,"Hours of fun. It is bright and colorful. My little one is almost 4 months old and enjoys this already as the head rest provides more support. She didn't know where to look first! The reviews on this model were the best, so I took a chance, and they were right!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent purchase!,This jumper exceeded out expectations! My little guy fell in love with it from the very first moment we sat him in it. The only thing he didn't love was the long setting of the music. Luckily there is a setting for the music to play only when he jumps. One thing that was slightly disappointing was the bee. It's too top heavy to stand on it's own so it just hangs of the side. I don't understand what the point of the bee is to just hang. Like I said that's only slightly disappointing so I still give it 5 stars!
Baby,4.0,Great,My son loves his bouncer! All the animal noises and toys keep his interest. It is also nice to be able to take this with us on road trips so he can play when we are on weekend trips at a hotel.
Baby,5.0,Hour of fun,"My baby girl loves her jumperoo. She was 6 months old when we bought it and she is a jumping fool. 2 months later it still entertains her. Only complaint I might have is she flings her head back a lot to look around, and there is no support for that, and she sometimes hits her head on the white bar with the spinning sun.<br /><br />I was looking at a more expensive jumperoo that included more learning activities, but I think it would have just been a sensory overload for her. She prefers to jump and hear the music anyway."
Baby,5.0,Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperoo,Bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter. She loves it I got my moneys worth the first time she used it. Easy to put together.<br />I highly recommend it. Shipping was quick.  Janet
Baby,5.0,Provides hours of entertainment,"We bought this for our son for Christmas, when he was 4 months old. Ever since then, it has provided hours of delight and entertainment. He loves it and shrieks in excitement whenever we put him in the jumper. The adjustable height allows it to grow with him, and there are plenty of toys, colors, textures, and sounds, to keep him amused and stimulated. The music isn't anything I'd choose to listen to on my own, but as far as music on a kids' toy goes, it's better than average."
Baby,1.0,No Android Support,"First off, I want to express how much I REALLY REALLY WANTED THIS MONITOR TO WORK. I had the pleasure of attending CES in 2012 and I saw Withings products first-hand I was really impressed. - As an Android fan, I was a little miffed that everything was tailored for Apple products, but I remained hopeful that they would soon be Android compatible. When I found out that they were, I told my wife so much about the monitor that she was interested too.<br /><br />The monitor was delivered on April 8, 2014.  The packaging was fantastic.<br /><br />The monitor itself felt pretty solid, even if it was a bit bulky and clunky.  Still, I like the simple design and the overall feel of the monitor. Inside the box was a power cord with multiple attachments for various outlets as well as the monitor stand and the instruction manual. Also included was an &#34;Android Quick Start Guide&#34; which was nothing other than a square of paper with a link top the app on the Google Play Store.<br /><br />When I tried to set up the monitor, I began experiencing some serious issues. The instruction manual ONLY has instructions for setting up the monitor with an iPhone or iPad. Nowhere in the manual are there any Android specific instructions, so I proceeded with the iPhone instructions. I was able to get the monitor paired with my device via Bluetooth and had the monitor and phone connected to my Wi-Fi. I was able to turn the night light on and off, as well as the lullaby feature with no issue. I could also speak into my phone and have my voice projected via the monitor. What I couldn't get was the video - which was the MAIN reason for getting this type of monitor. I tried restarting everything but I got the same result each and every time. I even went so far as to factory reset the monitor, uninstall the app from my device, and start all over again.  Same thing - no video, but everything else worked. I also had purchased a new cable modem/router, so I installed that, got it all activated through my provider and tried AGAIN with the Withings monitor to no avail. The only time I could get the video to work was when I connected the monitor and the router via an ethernet cord. Even then, I was able to get the video working on my device, but wife wife could not connect at all. I tried disconnecting my device then connecting hers (we both have the same Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.4.2) but her's would not connect.<br /><br />Exasperated, I attempted to contact Withings via their website, but that communication seems to have fallen on deaf ears because I never received any sort of response at all from them.  It's really disheartening as I was really hoping this monitor would work flawlessly as advertised, but it just didn't -- and it was disappointing. What made it even worse was the complete lack of communication from Withings - one would hope that a company would do their best to ensure a top-notch customer experience, but, in all honesty, they seem to lack any sort of customer service whatsoever.<br /><br />In short, I would say that I could not possibly ever recommend this product to anyone with an Android device. It just simply did not work as advertised, and trying to get support from Withings is impossible.ough my provider and tried AGAIN with the Withings monitor to no avail.

Baby,5.0,My daughter loves these,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 3 months old. She is now 7 months old and still likes them, although she will now take them off her wrists on her own and play with them. They were great toys when travelling by plain when she was 4 months old, no worries about them falling on the floor and the bright colors and noise kept her attention. I did not find them to be too quiet for her."
Baby,5.0,Big hit with 5 month old Granddaughter,"Easy to assemble, safe and sturdy and plenty of activity for little ones. She especially likes the 'dragonfly'. Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT,"I saw many reviews complaining about the red button that slides to get the wipes out.....I just bought this for my son and I LOVE it, never had a problem.!<br />Will be purchasing another soon :)"
Baby,4.0,Granddaughter loves it,Bought for our granddaughter to have at our house and she loved it. She has one similar at home but the color are brighter on this one.
Baby,5.0,So far so good!,My son loves this so far! He has played with the monkey more than using the pacifier! An that is fine with me! =)
Baby,4.0,Attaches to swing nicely,"This is nice because it has a strap that attaches to my sons Graco swing.  He likes to look at the giraffe and grab for the feet.  I wish it had music or something but he seems content with it, so I guess it is ok.  It is heavy for a baby toy so I can't hang it from his toy gym and hangs a little low so it can't hang from his carseat but it works for just normal play time and with his swing.  Good toy overall and would buy similar ones"
Baby,4.0,Toy and pacifier all in one!,Soooo cute!!! Item arrived late but the monkey is really cute. My lil guy loves it. He chews on the hands and feet when he isn't sucking the paci.
Baby,5.0,Game changer,"The Wubbanub has improved our lives so much, I keep wanting to send the inventor a handwritten thank-you note. This is my go-to baby shower present and I always say, You don't know you need this yet, but you do.<br /><br />It's as everyone says. The stuffed animal keeps the paci in the baby's mouth and makes it easier for the baby to grab himself. We just throw the whole thing in the washing machine and it gets super clean and awesome.<br /><br />The monkey is so important to our baby that we own two. I was too afraid of him losing the one we had!"
Baby,5.0,Adorable !,My son has been using it since birth. So cute I get many compliments on it & my son loves it he squeezes the monkey tight when falling asleep lol a little hard to clean but I can manage.
Baby,4.0,great portable toy,great portable toy thanks to the velcro strap. for now i use it on my baby's car seat to keep her entertained when we are out and about. she is only 2 months old and is just starting to show interest in it.
Baby,1.0,Red button slides open on it's own,"I've had this case for a while and have tried to make it work,for me, but it just doesn't do it's job.  The sliding red button isn't designed to snap into the closed position - it moves back and forth freely.  This means it constantly opens on it's own inside my diaper bag letting my wipes dry out.  The last thing I need when trying to change a screaming baby's poopy diaper in a public bathroom is a case of completely dry wipes."
Baby,5.0,Second Best Thing We Bought For Our Daughter,"Our 5 month old daughter absolutely loves this thing. She started using it when she was just 3 months old. Mind you, her feet don't even come close to reach the floor, even with the jumperoo at its lowest setting. Initially we put a pillow under her feet. Now she uses layered rubber alphabet mats, and we remove a layer as she gets taller. She might reach the floor at 6-7 months or so. The seat does an excellent job of supporting her, even back when she was 3 months old and didn't have the best head control. As she's gotten older, this toy has become more and more fun for her, to the point where she looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />A couple of observations regarding some of the other reviews I read on here (I read tons of them before deciding to buy this thing):<br /><br />- a lot of people complain that the elephant is facing the wrong way and hard to turn. The elephant is SUPPOSED to be facing the wrong way, the idea is for kids to turn him towards them, and then he swings back when they let go. There are animal sounds that get generated which correspond to most of the animal toys, including an elephant trumpeting sound. When that sound happens, I turn the elephant toward my daughter so she can associate it. I admit that the spring in the elephant is initially way too stiff for most children, but IT'S ADJUSTABLE! Just raise the elephant a bit and make him do a full clockwise turn, and voila, the tension is relieved. Now any kid can turn the elephant when they hear its sound.<br /><br />- I read some reviewers who claimed that their jumperoo came unhitched from one of the springs, causing their child to fall out. There's one such review in particular which has been pasted on here and many other reseller and manufacturer web sites, mostly verbatim on each one. Honestly, after seeing how this thing is hooked up, I can't understand how it could come unhitched accidentally. I suppose it's possible if the child jumped up way too high and the thing was set too low to begin with. Those reviews scared me a bit, but after seeing the attachment mechanism, I no longer have any concerns.<br /><br />- Someone mentioned that this thing could harm development of a child due to the impacts. That's ludicrous. Besides, our daughter spends at most 30 minutes in there, always supervised. I enjoy playing with her while she's in there. It's a fun activity we can do together."
Baby,5.0,Love this monitor!,"I absolutely love this baby monitor, it saves me many trips to the baby's room.  If she starts to cry I can quickly check to see if she is awake or just crying out then going back to sleep.  I use the night light every night as well as the ocean lullaby.  Sometimes I've needed the other lullabies to help calm her down from play mode.  I love that I can see the temperature and humidity in order to make sure she's comfortable.  Worth every penny."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,"My daughter loves this. We got it for her when she was 3-4 months - she couldn't do a lot with it at that point, but was happy to be &#34;standing&#34;. She is now almost 6 months and loves to play with all the toys on this jumperoo. It was super easy to put together, which is a huge plus.<br /><br />We bought a much more expensive jumperoo and found that it didn't fit together properly, and wasn't worth the extra money. That one got returned and we bought this one instead.<br /><br />Just buy this - you won't regret it."
Baby,5.0,Our son loves it,We bought this for our son when he was approximately 5 months old. He can't get enough of it. There are plenty of activities & sounds to keep him busy for a long time (though we try not to leave him in it for extended periods).
Baby,5.0,Best gift ever!,"I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas and I cannot even begin to say how much enjoyment she has had playing in this! The quality, colors and sounds bring a smile to her face every time she plays in it.  Great fun!<br /><br />Kim from Clarkston"
Baby,1.0,A serious and dangerous flaw,"We've had this monitor for a few weeks now, and I'm almost certain that the good reviews here are written by customers who didn't have or use this product for more than a few days. I say this because the monitor has many awesome features that you would love right out of the box, but once you try to rely on it you will realize how unreliable it is.<br /><br />I think other reviewers highlighted many of its pros and cons, but I think that any prospective buyer should be aware of one serious and dangerous flaw that makes this product not only worthless, but also harmful! At least once every one or two weeks the connection with the video feed will freeze, but instead of giving you a warning that the connection is frozen you will get a still image while the sound continues to work. So if the image freezes at a point when the baby is sound asleep and not moving you will continue to get this image regardless of what the baby is doing! My wife removed our baby from the crib and I was looking at the monitor and it continued to show me my baby sleeping in the crib! This is obviously horrible and scary.<br /><br />We continue to use the camera as a nanny cam but even at that it's not good. The night vision is horrendous and the occasional risk of the frozen image is still there. I will definitely recommend against buying this camera."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Only con to this is my baby can't reach/see the tucan or the frog and stuff (her sofie or pacifier) tend to just bounce off of it.
Baby,5.0,Absolutely love this thing...and so does my little boy!,"He is a sight to behold in this bouncer...beaming and dancing and bouncing.  He has all these little moves...balancing on one foot and swinging around, etc.  He knew he wanted one from the first time he saw it on video with a baby bouncing in it.  If he could talk, he would have said &#34;buy me that thing!&#34;  He has loved it, and so have I.  It seems very sturdy.  He was 6 months when we got it, and he's in the 75% for length.  He fit the longest setting, so there are 2 more settings as he grows."
Baby,5.0,Boy am I happy I didn't get a walker,"I was going to get my 6 mos old nephew a walker when I heard from his mom that walkers can be dangerous.  If you haven't read the consumer reports warning on walkers, I recommend checking it out.  While doing research on a replacement purchase I ran  across the jumperoo on amazon.  Boy am I happy that I got this instead.  My nephew is in love with the jumper.  His smiles and giggles every time he gets into the jumperoo are enough to melt your heart."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"It holds more wipes than I thought. Love the strap, keeps the container handy! The red slider popped off once but easily snapped back in."
Baby,5.0,Great place to play!,Love it! My 4 month old can sit in it for an hour. She loves the teether and looking up at the hanging frogs. It is large and be very mobile but that doesn't bother us. It is cool that it can fold up!
Baby,5.0,beautiful,the color is very good. bigger than the picture. my boy likes it very much. but it can not stand up.
Baby,5.0,"Love, Built to Last - Great resell potential","I have a jungle jumperoo and both my baby and I love it. I enjoy that she can turn herself to get to all of the different toys and that toys are fixed.<br /><br /> One of her jumpers has toys that come in and out and they get lost or have sharp edges. It is a lot of fun to see her get excited about jumping. I can turn music on and off and change the song and volume these are great for me because we have jumper time when I am doing laundry or dishes and sometimes I have to hear the sounds for 20+ minutes. Variation is good. Of all of the jumpers we have tried this is my favorite! Ours was a hand-me-down and is still in great shape!<br /><br />This toys is long lasting, well made and grows with your baby. Right now we are on setting 1 which is closest to the ground. There are 3 settings so the product can grow with baby."
Baby,5.0,"Happy baby, happy momma","My son absolutely loves this jumper. He's 5.5 months now and has used the jumper since he was 3.5 months. Every time he gets in it, which is every day for about 30 minutes throughout the day, he acts like it's his first time to experience it. Hopefully this is normal, and not an indication that he has a short term memory problem. In any case, he loves it and so do I because it allows me to have my hands free to get stuff done around the house knowing he's safe and happy."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"My baby started using this (with support underneath for his legs - they weren't long enough) when he was 5 months old...just for short periods of time. The toys were interesting to him. At 7 months old now, he loves it and he's tall enough to stand without support under him. It's a great entertainment for him and he loves to spin around to get to the different toys."
Baby,4.0,Nice option for a second stroller,"I have the Britax B-Ready as my primary stroller with the Britax brand caddy, both of which I love. I just added a second, more lightweight stroller (Mama's & Papa's Armadillo--love it, check it out!) and needed another caddy. The price was right on this one, and it fits perfectly. I can still fold the stroller even with it attached. I haven't tried putting a drink in it yet, but it seems like it will be fine."
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Jumperoo,"My daughter had one  that my granddaughter loved.  Rather than transport it when we babysit, we bought a second one.  She absolutely loves it.  One note, not all children will like it, but we've had two grandchildren who bounced to their hearts content.  It's a great buy for us."
Baby,4.0,Configuration over internet,"This product is very good, but I have problem with configuration to access camera over in internet, other point is the battery in iPhone or iPad, the expenditure is very high."
Baby,4.0,What a great idea,We go to the theme parks a lot and this is a wonderful product for just that. Quick clean ups without having to dig it out of the diaper bag over and over.
Baby,5.0,Great for Development,"Both of my twin daughters love these. They helped to develop their core muscles as they bend and hold the position so they can grab onto the bugs. They can be entertained by these for a good amount of time when they're laying down. They will stomp and kick and whatnot, causing the bugs to jingle and crinkle which sparked their interest in the toys all over again until they tire themselves out, which is an added bonus for me."
Baby,5.0,Great product,"My daughter loves this. It's like her security, she holds the monkey sometimes when the pacifier is in her mouth. My sister had one for my nephew and he loved it"
Baby,5.0,Collection complete,"My daughter loves it (or maybe it's just me) just what I wanted. We have a frog & giraffe, the monkey completed our collection"
Baby,5.0,Great for the little one,"This is great, my son loves it! He just jumps his little heart out so while he jumps I get to get things done that is needed."
Baby,5.0,LOVE!,"I absolutely love this case. It is sooo easy to use. I bought it over a year ago and I still use it everyday. It fits easily in Diaper bag pockets or your purse. You can use it one handed, it just makes life as a mom so much easier."
Baby,5.0,Best jumpy out there!,"We really researched these things as my husband reads every review of every product.  We saw this one had great reviews and after checking out some at the baby stores with which we were unimpressed, we decided on buying this one.  And then, we bought one for our sitter's house too!  Our little boy loved it!!  He loves to jump anyway, but this really got his attention and gave us some much needed time to do things around the house without having to carry him.  This was a sturdy jumpy and so much fun for him.  We'll be using it for our second one who's on the way as well because it's held up and still looks brand new."
Baby,4.0,Cute and Well Made,"These are super cute and a great idea, but my kid has zero interest in them. I have tried them multiple times over the last 3 months and the most use they have gotten is to be sucked on. However, they are a reasonable price and worth a shot. Not all kids are alike."
Baby,5.0,Fits Baby Jogger City Mini,"I bought this &#34;parent console&#34; because it is so much cheaper than the one from Baby Jogger. It fits perfectly on my Baby Jogger City Mini and I keep my wallet, a snack bag, my keys, and a drink in it. I like that you can fold the cup holders out of the way if you want. I don't see any problem with the stitching on mine and tugged on the attached strips to make sure they were sewn on securely. So far so good!"
Baby,5.0,You need this.,"I cannot say enough good things about this jumperoo. My daughter is currently jumping at least 6 inches into the air and squealing. She has the best time in her jumperoo!! She spends at least 30 minutes a day in it. She loves playing with the different toys when she's not jumping. And it is sturdy! Makes a lot of noise, but it's not going anywhere. This thing has provided me with some time to eat breakfast and work on other things without feeling like I just ditched her in the playpen. We started using it when she was 4 mo (had to put a box underneath for her feet) and are still loving it at 7 months. GREAT purchase!"
Baby,5.0,One of our favorite toys,"My son LOVES this thing! He's 5 months and on the short side, but the nice thing is that this jumperoo has three different height adjustments so the lowest setting is actually perfect for him. He loves the noises and bright lights. I love that it keeps him occupied ;). My 1 1/2 year old niece came over the other day and had a blast in it too. This jumperoo is a winner."
Baby,5.0,Worked great on the Swift Inglesina stroller,"I bought this for my Swift Inglesina stroller, and it was fantastic on our trip. It folds down with the stroller, so I didn't have to remove it when gate checking the stroller.<br /><br />When I got home from my trip, I switched it over to my larger jogging stroller, and it works great on there. Very versatile. Heavy-duty velcro."
Baby,2.0,not for uppababy stroller,"This does NOT work with an uppababy cruz stroller. It seems like a great organizer otherwise, unfortunately it does not fit an uppababy cruz stroller."
Baby,5.0,Fsher Price Rainforest Jumperroo,My grandson loves this. Keeps his attention a long time. H loves the animals to play at the same time
Baby,3.0,Can't have sound on,I cannot even use the volume. There is so much static that is so loud even when the volume on my iphone or ipad is turned on even the lowest volume
Baby,1.0,Good idea.  Poor Execution.,It didn't work at all so returned it.  There was no hole in the top peg through which air could be expelled to make the boat move.
Baby,5.0,GREAT PRICE/GREAT CAPS,These sealing discs are the only way to go when pumping into the avent bottles. They have been a necessity for me to have while pumping. I am able to pump directly into the bottles and cap them off using these discs. They are also a great price. It is not stated on the amazon page but this pack includes 6 discs. Way cheaper than babies r us. Would highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,Best baby gear item we've owned,"I have two kids, one aged 2.5 and one 6 months.  My youngest has been different from my oldest in just about every respect except for how much they have both loved the Rainforest Jumperoo.  With my oldest in particular, this was a godsend.  He hated not being held by me for almost all of his first year and it was extremely difficult for me to get a minute to myself, except for when he was in this jumperoo.  When he was old enough for the jumperoo, his face would light up and he would shriek with delight as he jumped up and down like a crazy person.  He would play in it for 15-20 minutes at a time and would love it.  My youngest is the same.  She grins from ear to ear as she's bopping up and down in this thing, trying to put the various toys in her mouth.  She is just so happy, it brings me such joy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this baby gear item.  It's worth every penny and every inch of floor space it takes up in our small apartment."
Baby,5.0,6 mos old loves it.,"It is Bright and colorful, and I was glad the toys were big enough for the baby to  get to with his tiny hands yet still be able to grab  the toys."
Baby,1.0,it will break. its just a matter of how long it takes,I bought this for my 5 year old son for easter. As I was putting it together on easter eve one of the pieces broke. I glued it  and got it back together for easter morning. MY son was very excited on easter morning. He started to play with it and one of the other pieces broke almost instantly . So we went out to the shop and I made replacement pieces for the one I broke and the one he broke out of black walnut . Today the first tuesday after easter the final piece that I had not replaced broke. So I will make the last piece for him after work today. I would not choose this product again
Baby,4.0,Good for single stroller,Nice product but does not come in double stroller size or longer connection strap for a side by side double stroller. oh well has to return it. But I do have another one for my single stroller well great!
Baby,4.0,Nice music,"We use this mobile mainly for the music. My daughter is old enough at this point where she will turn on the music in the morning herself. I like that you can choose to use just the light, light and music or just the music. The timer is just right."
Baby,5.0,Best wipes case yet,"I have a 2 year old and 5 month old. Wipes are necessary everywhere we go. With one swipe, and a quick pull, one wipe dispenses easily. I love that. I can't wait to buy this item for future mom-friends of mines."
Baby,2.0,worked ok until 8 month old got a hold of it,"It worked ok, I had a connection problems often and while I would have the application running on my phone I would not get incoming text notifications and when a call came in or my alarm went off the monitor would shut off. the picture was clear and options for music and night light worked well.<br /><br />The real problem came along when my 8 month old son started pulling himself up, he got a hold of the camera and ripped it from the plug and moved the inner USB port and it no longer would plug in and charge after that."
Baby,5.0,Thank God for this!,I put this in the kitchen and let me little ball of energy jump and play away.  She has been a huge fan of this since about 6 months.  it usually gives me at least 10 minutes of break time and is easy to adjust as your kid gets taller.  She will probably only get about 5 months use out of it (she is almost walking and is super tall) but I still think it was worth the cost.
Baby,4.0,Baby Jumper,"Our grandson loves to bounce in this.  It is very stable, but a bit cumbersome to move around the house.  Glad to have here when our babies come to visit"
Baby,5.0,BEST jumper EVER!,"FAVORITE JUMPER EVER! I worked in a nursery for four years and we had this jumper in our classroom. Every baby loved it and I knew someday when I had my own child this would be the jumper I wanted. Thank goodness they still make them because as soon as my daughter was born we bought it! My daughter is now 4 months old and loves this so much! Even before she could move her legs she loved being able to stand up in this and play with the spinners and hear the sounds, see the lights. She plays in it more and more everyday. Best jumper ever! So glad they still make them."
Baby,5.0,Works great!,"It was easy to setup and I love the clip that attaches it to the crib. The application has alerts for temperature, humidity, sound, and motion that works even if you are using a different app on you iPad/iPhone."
Baby,5.0,Great granddaughter rates it a 10,"Babies like to be involved in what is going on in the house and this Jumperoo is a fun thing to have in the house. She loves to play with the toys, jumps and sings and does all the stuff babies do. I would buy this again."
Baby,5.0,Very happy baby,She really loves this jumperoo. She's jumping and you know that she's having fun with it. She's likes everything on this jumperoo it keeps her very busy.
Baby,5.0,It does exactly as how it is advertized.,"We are pleased with this purchase.  It holds up very well on our stroller. We've place quite a few somewhat heavy things including multiple keys, drinks and cellphones and not once did it feel like it was going to break or fall off.  I'm sure after some wear and tear this little buggy pouch will need replacing and we know where we'll be buying another one from.  Overall, it does the job."
Baby,5.0,A must,Great addition to my prams. I have the baby jogger summit double And the mountain buggy terrain. Easy to swap from pram to pram. Holds my chai and a bottle of water + phone wallets and keys!!
Baby,5.0,Our favorite,We love this and will be sad to give it up when we hit the 6 month mark!  He sometimes will suck on any available piece which has been a source of fun for us.
Baby,5.0,Great colors and design.,"Really nice toy. My newborn enjoys looking at the colors and listening to the sounds it makes. Also, I don't mind the look of it in my living room. Having interesting toys in nice colors makes the house look less like a day care!"
Baby,5.0,Clark can't get enough,"I don't know yet if my kid is going to be a runner, soccer star, or swimmer.  In any case, he will have some crazy strong legs from the hours he spends on this."
Baby,5.0,Great when you are breastfeeding/storing Breast milk,"These are PERFECT to seal the top of your event bottles to store in the freezer right after breastfeeding/pumping/expressing. It holds tight inside of the &#34;ring&#34; of the bottle, sealing the entire bottle off from the outside air/elements. Does its job perfectly."
Baby,2.0,Very unpredictable,"Terrible customer service (non-existent), incredibly unreliable Iphone app, no pan/tilt (everyone concurs it appears).<br /><br />Gone through several baby monitors and can't seem to find one that does all that I need:<br /><br />1. Pan/Tilt - very hand when your baby/toddler moves around the crib<br />2. Temperature sensor - critical if you live in environments where temps get either warm or very cold<br />3. Secure Wifi connection (including no internet connection required) - able to view on the internet when necessary (nice to have if you're using the camera as a security cam/nanny cam.)<br />4. Night vision - good, clear screen when it's dark.<br /><br />So far the only monitor with these capabilities is Lorex, but their customer service is horrible and the product is not reliable. Poor screen clarity...been waiting nearly 2 months for them to send me a replacement. I've tried it all the top end cameras - including Motorola, Samsung, Summer, and now Withings. Very disappointing. I should get into this business and do it right!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"My boy loves it, he is beginning to see and calls attention the bright colors, I'm glad I bought. I recommend it"
Baby,5.0,Bought 2,"I bought one then loved it so much, I immediately bought another. I had been eyeing this for a few years in my Wishlist and saw the price dropped, so I went for it.<br /><br />It doesn't fold up however I keep it attached to my stroller by just undoing one side when it's time to fold up the stroller. It can withstand getting smushed (it arrives flattened). You wouldn't be able to keep big things in it once folded but why would you? That would just makes things fall out into the trunk of your car.<br /><br />I've used it so far on my Chicco Keyfit travel stroller (the built-in one is useless) and my Maclaren traveller stroller frame. I wish the zippered section was a bit bigger but it's not a big deal, I keep little doggy bags in there so that I have quick access when there's a diaper or clothing blowout.<br /><br />The sides for drinks are stretchy, so you can fit bottled water, cups from the mall, sippy cups, whatever.<br /><br />Love love love this purchase!<br /><br />Maybe the only downside is because I keep unhooking/rehooking, the velcro is starting to get a bit worn...but it still works perfectly and I make sure that I vary the sides that I unhook each time I fold my stroller back up."
Baby,5.0,You need this,I love having this for my baby boy.  I can put him down with a pacifier and not have it fall out.
Baby,5.0,I had my doubts,"My wife bought this after hearing a couple people talk about them on Facebook.  I had my doubts, as to why we needed this.  But it really does help our 3 month old sleep better.  When the pacifier pops out of his mouth, it usually gets lost.  This doll helps to keep it  in his mouth because it rests on his chest. He spits it out much less than before."
Baby,4.0,good attachment,Great Job Philips at getting this modular attachment for the bottles. Now you can use the bottles as food storage too!
Baby,5.0,Love it,Love this withings smart baby monitor .. My husband is out of town all the time and with this monitor he can always see the baby ... It's perfect for working parents ...
Baby,4.0,Love it.,"Very sturdy and safe, 6 month old baby loves it. Only have 2 songs, after while, the song will stuck to your head, that is the only complain I got."
Baby,5.0,Love IT!,"Would appreciate more from the ios/android apps and more accurate vital signs, But it works well and agree that it is probably one of the best out there"
Baby,5.0,Purchased 2,"This is such a good jumper, my 6 month old granddaughter loves it.  We purchased a 2nd one to have at my house.  It does adjust up and down, but she is a little too short yet.  We just put a pillow under here so she can bounce.  It's great entertainment for her."
Baby,5.0,Great toy !,My sit month twins love it! they are so happy to play with it. A lot of fun and laugh!!!
Baby,2.0,Very Basic,"My son is very curious and I had hoped something about this would appeal to him but it was very base and he really does not even pay attention to it, unfortunately. It is cute enough and well made but it just does not attract my child."
Baby,2.0,Doesnt Close Well,"It is pretty, but it will open on its own inside the diaper bag and all the wipes will dry out."
Baby,5.0,my baby loves his jumperoo! !!,My 7months old baby loves his jumperoo.<br />He knew exactly what to do as he sat on it....He figured out jumping within seconds.  He loves how his seat rotates 360 degree.  Funnily he tries to do the same on the high chair and even on his baby float.  He loves to pkay with the toys... but guess fisherorice could do better with that. Also the sound are a bit less.<br />However its easy to setup and took me about 10mins without the manual too.<br />I had ordered this from amazon...I loved the fact that I received it within 3 working days from USA to dubai.
Baby,5.0,My son Loves these!,He cant sleep without these! We have purchased 3 of these so far! Very satisfied the tricky part will be taking it away!
Baby,5.0,Twins Love It!,"Both of my daughters love this jumper!<br />We got a Little Einstein jumper at our baby shower and that one is nice too but the FP Rainforest Jumperoo is just awesome. Like the other reviews said the LE seems to be for older babies and isn't nearly as buoyant as the FP.<br />They are always trying to chew on the little dragon fly and are now at 6.5 months trying to reach for the bird and frog above them. They pretty much use all facets of the FP jumper and they just look so happy when they get going, like it really gives them wings. When I have one baby in each bouncer it's almost like who ever is in the LE is looking at her sister like she wants to be in the FP jumper... Two thumbs up!"
Baby,3.0,Could be better,"Hangs right in his face maybe its the car seat , but i think they shoul have made it smaller or more adjustable. Otherwise my baby seems to like him."
Baby,5.0,"Baby loves it! Easy to assemble, adjust and store!","I looked at sooooo many jumpers for my baby. Checked reviews, did my own research at the baby stores, etc. I originally had gotten the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn and I returned it because it was just too clunky. It did not fold up to store and it had a huge piece that went overhead that I didn't like. I received the Fisher Price Step 'N Play as a gift and my baby when she was 6 months and I love that one, but it doesn't jump and I found my daughter wanting to always jump as she learns to crawl, stand and get more mobile at 8 months old. So I got this one because a ton of my friends have it for their babies. I also put my baby in it to see if she liked it and she did! I put this together in about 10 minutes, I've adjusted in about 3 minutes. My daughter loves it and I love it. I would definitely recommend this and think this is one of the better jumpers that Fisher Price has designed."
Baby,5.0,get 2,My daughter loves these. the toy is plush and soft. I wash them in the Born Free sanitizer then hang dry. the toy helps keep the pacifier in place and makes it easier to find.
Baby,2.0,HUGE,"This thing takes up a TON of floor space. My 5 month old girls are too short for it on it's lowest setting (they are about 25 inches tall now), so it's not comfortable for them yet. They did seem to like the toys on it though. I got so tired of walking around it and having to look at it that I broke it down and shoved it into a closet. I'd recommend a smaller jumper (like the Graco bumper jumper with musical floor pad, which we love) unless you have a lot of space."
Baby,3.0,the leaves quit working after 4 weeks,My daughter loves this mobile even after the leaves quit working.  I tied the leaves up and am able to continue using it.  I am disappointed at how quickly the leaves quit working.
Baby,5.0,I love it,thanks
Baby,4.0,Wish the pacifier was the harder Soothie,"This pacifier is great for older babies with some motor control to be able to put it back in their mouths by themselves.  Since it is ideal for babies 4 months+ I am not sure why the company uses the softer 0-3 month Soothie on this.  My child hasn't bitten through it, but she has a harder suck now and it would be better if the paci didn't have as much give."
Baby,5.0,great product,my daughter uses it for hours and it seems to be making her legs stronger. Good product and I recommend it.
Baby,5.0,keeps my lil one entertained,I bought this when my baby was 4 months old and he would just sit in it and look around. Then as days went by he started exploring all the toys and rotating in the seat. Now he is 5 months and simply loves his jumperoo. I put him in it when he is very energetic and excited and it tires him out completely ensuring a fuss-free nap time.
Baby,5.0,Great additional pockets,"This works well on my Graco stroller. It's nice to have the additional storage, especially for strollers like Graco that don't provide great storage capacityl."
Baby,5.0,Must have!!!,If your baby only likes the soothie binky like mine then this is a must have. I read reviews and bought two like a lot of people said. Great idea!! Love the wabbanub!!
Baby,4.0,Many activities for son,My son enjoys this jumperoo. He has many things to play with and usually stays in it about 30-45 min before he becomes fussy. In that space of time I can get plenty done. The swivel chair makes it easy for him to play with other toys once he gets bored with the other. He has also learned problem solving...he knows that he needs to bounce or hit a toy in order for him to hear the music. Overall I'm satisfied.
Baby,5.0,super cute!,"I love this monkey pacifier!  Great idea!  My son wasn't a big fan of pacifiers.  However, I purchased this as a gift for other friends and their babies loved it.  They also loved it as well because they wouldn't lose it.  Their babies would hold onto the monkey while sucking on the pacifier."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"My son looooooves this. He jumps and jumps and jumps. I can shower, cook and do a little laundry while he jumps and plays with the different pieces. I highly recommend it. It was very easy to assemble."
Baby,5.0,Very good,I became very happy to get this. The product is produced with good material. I recommend to everyone. Buy it
Baby,5.0,"Fits great, great price",Pros:<br />Fits the Combi double and City Mini very well.<br />holds drinks nice a snug.<br />nice price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Talk drinks will hit the handle bar<br /><br />I do recommend it
Baby,5.0,Spend your money on this!,"We were debating wether to buy this or not since they had already let us borrow an exersaucer. My baby just turned 6 months and he is on the chunky side, the exersaucer was really big around his body which caused his arms to fall in there and he would just cry until i would pull out his arms and position them were the toys are. The exersaucer is also very heavy for the baby to actually start moving it. This jumperoo has a nice snug fit around the baby, the toys are at level and easy for them to grab, my baby loves jumping on this thing so much. I can put him for about 30 mins or a lil longer while i do laundry or clean the house. I also want to add that my baby did not use to have a lot of leg movement and after he used the jumperoo he now starts to jump off our legs when we have him on our lap. It has made him so active with his hands and legs, he has even fallen asleep on this thing! The jumperoo is lightweight, i have a small house, we always have it in the living room or kitchen and i just drag around. I have carried it away in my small suv too. I need it so i  just cannot complain about this item."
Baby,2.0,Too big.,Too big for car seat - works okay to dangle from a swing. Doesn't jitter or pull down which was the point for me.
Baby,2.0,Too big.,Too big for car seat - works okay to dangle from a swing. Doesn't jitter or pull down which was the point for me.
Baby,5.0,GREAT SHOWER GIFT,"Very colorful hanging toy for crib, stroller or activity gym.  nice size made very well.  love the colors and fabric used, soft and silky"
Baby,5.0,2 of these!!,"This is simply the best of its kind of all jumpers. We have tried all the rest and now regularly buy this as a gift for all those that have babies. Good quality, easily to build, easy to clean. A bit of a struggle to adjust as child grows but not a major issue."
Baby,5.0,A must-have for Avent system,"I was hesitant to buy these because of the price for little pieces of plastic, but they are a must! The Avent system makes life SO much easier, and these discs are part of that!"
Baby,5.0,Baby loves her WubbaNub!,"I'm soo happy with the WubbaNub I got for my daughter! It's becoming the new &#34;it&#34; baby item everywhere, I had to jump on the band-wagon and get one for my newborn! :-)"
Baby,1.0,squeaked!,"I am so bummed that this mobile didn't work out for us!  It is super darling and works well!  Unfortunately, after a week of use it started to squeak.  Amazon customer service refunded us and we bought a Tiny Love mobile instead.  I am starting to find that Tiny Love products are built better than Fisher Price or Baby Einstein."
Baby,5.0,This is the best,This was a gift for my son and daughter in law. My son  wanted this monitor and only this monitor. Everything about it is great. He loves it. The picture is clear. You can see everything. He can even see his baby daughter on the way home from work through his phone. It's expensive but well worth it
Baby,5.0,Love it,Bought this for my grand daughter who is three months old.  Works great.  She can hold the monkey and the pacifer<br />stays in her mouth.  Monkey is nice and soft.  Life saver
Baby,5.0,Really Great!,My 4 month old LOVES this!  She jumps and jumps and loves playing with the toys on it. Everyone is happy during jumperoo time!
Baby,5.0,很可爱的玩具,"Very lovely toy, is unable to hold oneself back to the open look, color is very bright, hope unborn child like this gift."
Baby,2.0,I wish I could return it,"I received this as a gift months before my baby was born and, therefore, did not have time to test it out before the return window expired (I was not aware there was an expiration in the first place). It frequently does not communicate will with my iPhone even though the internet connection is great. I can never rely on the monitor to be functioning properly. It's essentially worthless because, even when it does work, I can hear my baby cry before the signal is transmitted to my phone. I am so disappointed I can't return it for one that is functional. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I do like to watch baby in her crib to see if she is actually sleeping.  Also, there is no way to turn off the monitor. We have to unplug it or turn of the notifications in the iphone each time we go into her room so that my phone doesn't sound alerts. It's inconvenient and frustrating. I won't be purchasing any products from iBaby  in the future."
Baby,5.0,Love the Jumperoo!,"We purchased this jumperoo for our 5 1/2 month old son, and he was all smiles the moment we placed him in it!  It's light and compact, with additional toys to capture his attention, but not so many toys that it makes the entire thing look too &#34;busy&#34;.  He's 26&#34; tall, and his feet reach the floor at the lowest level 1, so he'll still get a lot of use out of this as he grows taller.  Great product!"
Baby,5.0,Great for transporting bottles,I use these to transport bottles so no leaking. Great buy! Use these with the old event rings on the new advent bottles and no leaking :)
Baby,5.0,More than worth the price!,"This thing works perfectly with the Contours Lite stroller I picked up for a family vacation with my 9 month old. I didn't even add the cup holder that came with the stroller because it is not nearly as good as this one. It can hold phone, keys, a small purse/wristlet, a beverage (up to a quart OJ ;-) and a tube of puffs. I kept it on when I collapsed the stroller for gate check and trunk storage, too."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves this,"My son will bounce in this thing until he is so tired he can't stay awake.  He loves the little toys, lights and music.  Really, he can't get enough!  The toys come off easily to wash.  Easy to assemble.  It does &#34;collapse&#34; for storage, but it really doesn't take up much less room so we just keep it together."
Baby,5.0,fabulous  gift,This is not only cute but loved by the baby and parents. I think it is a wonderful gift for a baby!
Baby,1.0,"Good idea, poor execution","This is a good idea with lots of nice features, however the implementation leaves much to be desired. We bought this 7 months ago and it often works, but has serious drawbacks. The main problem is that if your internet is down the monitor stops working. I could understand if you needed internet to set it up and obviously it is needed for remote streaming, but it shouldn't be required if you are just streaming in the house.  This alone gives the monitor a one star because it is a basic feature.  Hopefully they'll remedy this in the future.<br /><br />Update:<br />It turns out the hardware isn't all that great either.  It got bumped and the part where the plug goes came slightly loose.  So, now the plug doesn't stay in unless you hold it there and so the battery won't charge so the unit is useless.<br /><br />I hope Withings improves their software and hardware because the feature set is nice."
Baby,5.0,Works fine,"Simple and useful. Works well with the baby jogger summit x3 double stroller. We use it all the time. Not much else could be said, really."
Baby,4.0,6 month old Grandson likes it.,"The varied activities and the  ability to rotate the seat to access them keeps the childs interest longer. The only downside is the size, which is required for safety and stability. In a small apartment this could be an issue."
Baby,5.0,Easy to use and wash,So easy to pop these in to store the bottle and then pop out and put a nipple in its place when it's time to eat.
Baby,1.0,No Android compatibility,"Setup was impossible, had to return it. Their Android app didn't perform nearly as well as the ios app. Their method of adding multiple users is extremely convoluted."
Baby,5.0,Just as expected!,It arrived when expected and it's everything we expected it to be! My grandson loves to make it jump! Good quality!
Baby,5.0,stroller caddy,"love this to keep our key, phone whatnot.<br />it fits our uppa baby stroller as well as the city mini.<br />must have for us."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub Pacifier,My granddaughter has used these since birth and loves it.  I had to get one to keep at my house.
Baby,5.0,Kept my little one entertained.,"Bought this when my baby was 2months old. Even now at almost 7months, he is still very much interested in looking at the animals go round and round. He is never once bored when I turn it on. It comes with 3tunes and 1rainforest sound. In any music mode baby is kept entertained for 15mins. Sometimes he will call out when it stops and wants more. Great to use when you need to keep your little one entertained while you are busy."
Baby,5.0,great jumper,There are a lot of options for a child to play with.  It's colorful. The chair turns which is great so that he can move to all sides.
Baby,5.0,Great purchase!,Our daughter just turned 9 months old and she absolutely loves her rain forest jumper!  It keeps her occupied & tires her out 😊<br /><br />It is a little bulky in size as far as taking up space and the chair doesn't swivel very easily.  It does allow for lots of jumping and swaying though & was very easy to assemble.  I don't think your little one will be disappointed!
Baby,5.0,Great Item,"I have a few of these, on my stroller, and on my scooters as well.<br />It holds water bottles, baby bottles and sippy cups well."
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub,My grandson loves it and uses it everyday very pleased. I am sure anyone who purchases one will be very satisfield as I am.
Baby,3.0,Not quite that entertaining.,I thought my little girl would like this way more than she actually does. She is 6.5 months now. She doesn't seem to enjoy jumping as much as I thought she would. The entertainment on the toy gets rather old and she gets frustrated in it after a few minutes. She seems to love her Evenflo exercsaucer compared to this Jumperoo. I feel like it was a waste of a lot of money. If your child is active and might love to jump for hours on end maybe this would work for you. Didn't for me.
Baby,5.0,Met my expectations,"I love this monitor. I have no complaints, I love being able to check on my son while at work"
Baby,4.0,Much better than 3 other brands I tested,"Ever since I found my wife was pregnant, I started to look for a baby monitor I could also use with my iOS device and one of my first choices was the Withings Smart Baby Monitor.<br /><br />All the bad reviews made me look else where and I started to test other brands, Motorola, Summer Infant, Dropcam, etc.<br /><br />I quickly eliminated all brands and my only choice left was the Dropcam Pro which is great, but it doesn't have the temperature and humidity sensors, or the comfort lights or the ability to play music.<br /><br />Finally, when all other options disappointed me, I dared to test the Withings Smart Baby Monitor and ordered one through Amazon.  As soon as it arrived, I opened it, set it in minuted and loved it from the moment it powered on.  No other baby monitored provided the video and sound quality this one did.<br /><br />What would I change and why the 4 stars?  the mounting option is very limited, but so are all the others.  Also, the micro-usb power connection is prompt to fail if you are not careful, it happens on many devices with these power connection.<br /><br />Do not read all other feedback, try it for yourself and create your own opinion, I (knocking on wood) haven't experienced all the issues everyone complain about, then again, I work in IT and I know how technology works."
Baby,5.0,My baby loves it,"There are so many activities to do on this Jumperoo. So unless your LO is cranky, he/she will not get tired of playing in it."
Baby,5.0,My son loves this...still,"So, I bought this for my son when he was 3mos old.  He was sitting up and could reach the floor by then.  This toy really helped him with his hand-eye coordination and strengthen his legs and back.  he started crawling early due to all the extra exercise he got in this jumper.  Plus he absolutely loves all the different objects that light up, spin, rings, etc.  He's now 8mos old and he still loves to jump in it!"
Baby,5.0,Love it and would recommend it to anyone who needs help with tummy time.,"On time from when I ordered and love the product.  Easy to use, easy to wash and baby doesn't hate tummy time as much now."
Baby,3.0,Poor communication,"I have a 15mbps fiber optic dedicated internet connection , although the communication is poor, the link between monitor and my iphone losts everytime. Distance between devices is no more than 5 meters. Why?<br />Ricardo Salcedo."
Baby,1.0,Not worth the money when your baby's life depends on it!,"I have had this monitor for quite a while, and never use it independently. I actually set up a second monitor because the Withings often loses the connection and will not reconnect. I can never depend on this to work. I have also been unable to connect through the Internet. I can only connect through my home wifi, and the connection is always unreliable. I have several other devices that connect via blue tooth connection, and they remain connected with no problem.  Save your money - this isn't an inexpensive monitor, and buy something else!!!!"
Baby,3.0,Owned and returned,"This monitor has bugs, plenty of them.  It can be an excellent monitor if they work out the bugs.<br /><br />Ive used this monitor for about 15 days wasn't impressed with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Takes too long to connect every-time the app is launched.<br />Disconnects randomly(50 Mbps internet speed)<br />Drains your battery.<br />Video quality is not that that great<br /><br />pros:<br />Easy set up.<br />Works with IOS Devices.<br />Customer Support is good.<br />I can see my son everywhere as long as i have an internet connection."
Baby,4.0,Jumperoo,This is a great little item.  The baby can spin around and jump.  There are alot of things for baby to do.  The colors are bright and colorful.  Decent price.
Baby,5.0,positive,Very practical and well-fitting bag. We will take the walks very good use. I'll be the best-equipped. good goood goood
Baby,5.0,baby jumper,"This is a fairly good alternative for a baby walker, which now are not recommended for babies.  Two grandchildren use it and seem pretty happy with it and its activities.  It is a little hard to get them out of, but not a big problem.  I do wish the cloth seat part of the item were removable and washable."
Baby,5.0,Great Quality for the Price,"I chose Diono because it is very affordable. At $8.99, if you hate it, no big loss, if you like it, an A+! I own a Britax B-Agile stroller and from other customer reviews, it should fit. Sure enough, it fits the stroller, and if you fold the stroller, it will fold with it too. No need to take off the organizer. This product uses velcro straps to secure onto the stroller handles and is made with sturdy, good quality materials. Its simple to put on, and includes a zipper compartment inside, and two cup holder sections. Definitely recommend!"
Baby,5.0,great toy,My son loves this toy.  It has many things for him to grab a hold of.  Multiple textures and bright colors.
Baby,1.0,"Especially for Android users, AVOID THIS MONITOR!!!","Although this monitor has some really good hardware behind it, the software is TERRIBLE, especially on the Android platform.  Frequent crashes (Nexus 7 tablet, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Asus Transformer) are the norm, if you can even connect (when I'm on the same home network, I frequently get an error that the monitor can not be found, even when my PC and iPad connect just fine).  Also, sound is TERRIBLE, especially on the Nexus 7 tablet (choppy)... network speed was *not* the issue...<br /><br />Withings just doesn't respond to email it seems, and they don't update their app.  *VERY* disappointed in this product.<br /><br />Update:  I *finally* received a response 15 days later... Essentially, they just said they know that it doesn't work well, can't say when an update will be available, and said they'll forward my \\""feedback\\"" to their development team.  The website still states that it works with \\""Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher\\"", knowing full well that it does not."
Baby,5.0,Best new baby item!,With two day prime shipping... I just received the rainforest jumperoo.  It took me all of 10 min to assemble and it feels very sturdy and durable. I put my little guy (3.5 months) in it and he quickly smiled and started to happily check out all the toys. I know he is going to love this toy for many months!
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I have owned this for over a year and there have been nothing but issues. The app is terrible. I have to clear data, force stop, and uninstall frequently just to get it work. When it does work, it frequently stops working for one reason or another. I thought the application would be improved in the year that i have owned this but it has actually gotten worse. Now, i am not able to get the application to work for more than 15 minutes. This is a great concept but terrible execution from Withings. Save yourself some time, money and headaches by buying something else. I wish I would have returned this product. The only thing it is good for is playing wave sounds and this always works because it is done from the monitor itself. I can't see spending this kind of money for a box that plays wave sounds and lullabies."
Baby,5.0,Works great for baby jogger summit x3 double stroller,"I have a baby jogger summit x3 double stroller for my twins and needless to say, we needed more &#34;shelf space&#34; to hold car keys, bottles... The small stuff. This product works great. It is made well, has two ares where bottles could be held and a larger area between that is great for snacks and keys. It fits the length of the right hand seat and doesn't interfere with the hand break on the left side. It stays on even when folded up. And even better... It is 1/3 the price of the baby jogger brand for a similar product. Highly recommend."
Baby,4.0,Not bad,This Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Otganizer is not bad for my stroller.. Easy fit for any stroller.. I like it
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,My baby is almost 5 months old now and she has been enjoying the jumper since before she was probably supposed to be in it!  She has so much fun and can really fly around in this thing.  I would get in it if I'd fit.
Baby,3.0,it's ok,It holds 2 bottles on each side and have an inner pocket in the center.<br />We bought this for City Mini Baby Jogger.<br /> it's better than nothing.
Baby,5.0,Does what it needs,"Works great, stays in place, Velcro doesn't come undone. Great buy at a great price! I use it on my Joovy sit & stand."
Baby,5.0,awesome sauce,"This is awesome! Easy to assemble, tons to do for baby and easy to clean.  Baby loves it too! Money well spent."
Baby,4.0,My daughter's favorite,"My 4 month old loves her little monkey. She doesn't use it as a pacifier very often, but she loves the monkey. The monkey is the perfect size for her hand and she likes to swing it around. Later when she needs a little soothing, she will grab it by the head and put the the pacifier part in her own mouth. It gives her independence.<br /><br />It is also easy to clean. I simply use a bottle brush to wash the nipple and then pop it into our sterilizer. I then leave it on the bottle rack for 30 minutes and it's dry."
Baby,3.0,Kind of weird...,"This fit my Summit X3 just fine, but is is really bendy and doesn't offer much by way of room for stuff."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"My husband bought this for our 3 month old son, and he adores it! He even smiles when he sees it! I highly recommend the WubbaNub! I think we'll get the turtle and elephant next!"
Baby,5.0,4 Month old's new favorite toy,Bought this for our 4 month old's first road trip and she loved it!  It hangs nicely from our Britax car seat but she prefers to hold it.  It now comes with her everywhere. Highly recommend for the price!
Baby,5.0,A wonderful distraction for a busy body baby,"The reviews were right-this is an awesome toy for babies who crave stimulation! My little will sit in this and jump, play, squeal and laugh to herself and would do that all day if we let her. The item was very easy to put together with minimal assembly required. The seat rotates, but I noticed it's not a very smooth rotation. Once the baby is older, I suspect it'll be easier and easier for her to rotate on her own. Great quality and product by Fisher Price, as usual!"
Baby,4.0,Cute,"Purchased for baby grandsons on the suggestion from a friend.  The animal helps keep the pacifier from flying out of their mouth, easier to find"
Baby,5.0,Great value,Works great on my new stroller and is very good quality for the price. Easy to put on and holds just enough
Baby,5.0,"Great toy, even though folding is useless","We got this when LO was 4 months old. At first she was not very sure about it. It took her about a month to figure it out, but once she did, there was no end to joy! Now she makes &#34;jumping&#34; motion the moment her feet touch any hard surface! It is so funny.<br /><br />This is a quite big and clunky piece of baby plastic. I was hoping to be able to fold it an move to a different room in the evenings, and this was the only model that &#34;folds&#34;. That was also one of the reasons I got this model. But it did not really work out. It does not really fold very far. The footprint gets just a bit smaller, and when &#34;folded&#34; it is very difficult to move it around as it looses the structure and stability. So do not really count on that. Only get it if you have space when it can sit day and night, without being folded or moved around.<br /><br /> I still love it because the baby absolutely loves it and has so much fun in it. Ugly and all, baby will love it, and you will too."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,Everything was great! It had all the parts and was easy to put together. It didn't take long for it to ship either!
Baby,5.0,great toy,"I got this for my daughter as it is supposed to give lots of playtime.  It seem'd like the jumperoo was good for the period of time when the child out grew the exersaucer.  For a while, she would play with this for about 15-30 minutes but then was tired of it.  For me, she rarely will play in it now.  I hear from other parents, sometimes this works for months and sometimes for only a short period.<br /><br />My daughter is now 30&#34; tall.  I've got this set on height #3 so I'd say she could play in this for another inch and then she will have outgrown this.  If you have a tall child, this is a good item given the height it works until.  The toys have worked well.  I can't understand how a child is supposed to be able to twist the elephant but most of they toys are loved."
Baby,5.0,You Get What You Pay For.,"We purchased this bouncer for our 4 month old daughter who was beginning to show interest in supporting weight on her legs. Initially, she appeared a little overwhelmed by so much to look at but quickly grew to love it! This bouncer is well made, with three play areas and a butterfly our daughter loves to chew on. We leave her in it for 15 to 20 minute time intervals during the day, but she would stay in it much longer if we allowed it."
Baby,5.0,Great item,A must have.  I just bought a Baby Jogger City mini Single and it fits perfect.  The price is great.
Baby,5.0,Invaluable!,My son has Doen Syndrome and this has been so helpful with him learning to balance and use his arms to support himself his therapist was also impressed with his progress and tells me she will be buying one to use with her other clients
Baby,3.0,"Great, if you only intend to use it within your home while on your wifi network","Setup for this unit was fairly simple when only using it with an iPhone while on your own wifi network in the house. Setting up the software that came with it to view multiple cameras on a laptop was not very user friendly and seems like it requires far more manual steps and entries to get it to work than a modern unit of this cost should. Additionally, it constantly fails to connect and be viewable from a phone when you are outside of your own network. From everyone I've talked to, you need to be fairly tech savvy and do more manual configuring with your router in order to get this to work for viewing from home on any consistent basis. All in all, not worth the cost for my intended use, and they still haven't come out for an app to view on android, nor will any of the apps I found locate these cameras."
Baby,1.0,HOLY SH#$,"If you want your baby covered in POOP then don't bother with this thing.  Every time we put our 6 month old in this she has an unreal blowout and is covered in POOP all up her back to her neck.  It is absolutely unreal.  Sure, this thing is entertaining but be forewarned this really shakes up the tummy.  I regret every time I put her in it."
Baby,3.0,The first one was a bust!,"The mobile is beautiful. Our 5 month granddaughter is mesmerized by the rotating rainforest critters.  The sound is good.  Unfortunately , the top stopped rotating after about 5 days.  It would start and, within a minute, it would slow to a stop.  The batteries were new, and changing them did not help.  I wrote amazon and they credited my account and had a new Rainforest mobile delivered to our granddaughter.  Hopefully, the next time I am asked, I will give 5 stars."
Baby,1.0,The 2 top layer of leaves interact each other when it rotate and stop all the movement of the mobile.,The 2 top layer of leaves interact each other when it rotate and stop all the movement of the mobile.  It happen every time it start.<br /><br />It is a great design with super cute animals and leaves.  It fail in production/ product test quality control.<br />Very bad because it become not useable.
Baby,5.0,bouncer,One of my favorite purchases yet! This bouncer has great songs that aren't too annoying as well as three height adjustments. It has activities all the way around that my little one can spin and play with. Great buy and great price!
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"These work great for storing milk. No leaks. Simple to use, snap right in to avent classic or natural where as the old ones didn't. Love em!"
Baby,5.0,Amazing product,"Incredible product.<br />I believe withings may have fixed the negative review we see on here, because I had no problems at all.<br /><br />The alerts, audio, video, works as expected."
Baby,5.0,I was looking forward to getting this!!!,"My granddaughter LOVES this mobile. It is so colorful & cute!! The music is very soothing, & the remote is an extra bonus."
Baby,3.0,Good for short term use.,"This is a good sturdy case that holds a decent amount of wipes. Only problem is that if you don't use the wipes within a day or so, they dry out rather quickly. If you don't check them, you'll be left with dry kleenex and a very unhappy baby. I started storing the case in a large ziplock to keep them from drying out. This isnt the most convenient way to keep them. I'd recommend using this case for a day trip as long as you don't forget about refilling and checking the wipes for freshness."
Baby,5.0,Go for it!!!,"I always read the negative reviews first, so it took mea few weeks to decide on this jumper.  Just ignore those negative reviews...my baby girl is 6 mos old and loves this.  I was worried that it may be too stimulating, but the easy solution it to pop offtheother toys she isn't playing with...truly she doesn't see the toys on thering behind her so it's no big deal anyway.  It is very well built...quite sturdy and much safer than those doorway jumpers.  Well worth the cost and I would be surprised if it is something that lasts for several years so other children can play with it as well."
Baby,2.0,mobile gets stuck. music very quiet.,Baby loves.the animals and sounds. Unfortunately the mobil gets hung up on itself and requires a manual push to get it spinning again.
Baby,4.0,Only one thing could be improved,"I actually have this mounted on the bottom of a stroller being used as a gun cart.  Same basic idea, except mine holds a barrel of shotgun instead of a cup.  It's great material, installs easily, my sole complaint is that the cup holders are shaped by metal wires and have bent some in my trunk when the stroller is collapsed.  I wish it was a rubber material that would bounce back into shape each time this happens."
Baby,5.0,Nice caddy,"Fits my Mclaren Volo very well, even when folded. Love the extra space for my junk. Like it a lot."
Baby,5.0,great for travel,"These are great in the stroller or car bc you can slip them under a harness and much easier for baby to hold, since we don't attach our pacifiers.  I just wash it off and try to keep the toy part dry, or use a toy wipe."
Baby,5.0,Very nice,Very nice little thing here going for long walks with my son I can put my water cellphone keys and anything else in my handy stroller fanny pack thingy Lol!
Baby,2.0,Not much rattle,"Only one of the wrist rattles actually rattles, and it is not a very loud rattle. The other wrist toy is crinkly, but it takes a lot of effort to get it to make crinkle sounds. The wrist straps are also very large, so the item doesn't stay on baby very well."
Baby,4.0,Love it,Really like this toy for my infant son.  The only negative is when you wash it  the mirror gets funky.
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"Our son loves this - he is not large (born early :) and this gives a snug fit to his body and also good back support (so he is not tipping to any one direction). He loves the colors & the sounds too. And when he bangs on it, the music goes off so he is learning that he can &#34;make&#34; sound happen. Really a GREAT product!"
Baby,5.0,great choice for a jumper!,I read a lot of reviews on this and other jumpers and I'm very happy I chose this one. Our 5 month old absolutely loves it.
Baby,2.0,Not very durable.,"Dissappointed in the duration that this product lasted. One of the springs busted after 6 months of use. Our son was only 20 lbs at the time it broke, and it's rated for up to 25 lbs."
Baby,4.0,vgood,I liked the idea of ​​the product compared to its price recommend buying with the need to determine the need
Baby,5.0,Great tray!,I have used this tray for almost 4 years now and I love it as much now as I did when I first got it. I use it on my City Mini Jogging stroller and it works perfectly.
Baby,1.0,Not for larger babies,"In theory this product is great.  Very easy to put together. But my son is going to be five months soon and he could barely fit in the seat.  The leg holes are far too tiny and it's a struggle to put him in and out of it.  He's 28 inches and almost 18 lbs. Additionally, the seat doesn't spin unless I manually turn him.  Save your money of you have a child with my child's stats"
Baby,4.0,Good product,Good product And good Service solving some trouble with my address for delivery. I have this same monitor due to a present And i'm buying it now because it Works well. Could do better with The audio And thats why not 5 stars.
Baby,5.0,Bouncy baby!,"My daughter is 5.5 months and has been using this since 9 weeks. She LOVES it! She has a good stack of books on there because she doesn't reach the ground even at the lowest setting, but she had the head control for it so we let her bounce away. She's discovering the rattles and things now, has always like the butterfly that she can get in her mouth, and likes to look at the hanging bird and frog. Great to have in your kitchen so you can cook, etc..."
Baby,4.0,It's all you need...,Don't bother overpaying for one of these at fancy baby stores...this one is excellent and is a very good price. Has lots of space and is made well.
Baby,5.0,Our baby loves it!,"I read reviews before deciding on my purchase and I have no regrets! Baby doesn't bump into anything hard as she bounces unlike with other models. She likes reaching for the bird, loves playing with the toy sun, and loves chewing on the crinkly bug. Great buy!"
Baby,1.0,Stopped working,Received as baby shower gift.  First the leaves were getting stuck.  Now the whole thing stops at each rotation so I have to babysit it constantly.  Junk.
Baby,5.0,Does the job,"At first I had to play around with them to get them fitted correctly, but pretty easy and self explanatory."
Baby,5.0,Fits Baby Jogger City Mini Single,"Geez, I didn't know what I was missing out on. Cup holders, deep tray, light in weight, it's so useful! I can image the Velcro makes this very versitle"
Baby,5.0,Cute,This was really adorable and my baby loved it! I bought this instead of a fancy play gym because those gyms are crazy expensive and this was my last (surprise!) baby.  It was soft and I liked that I could reconfigure it for her to play with as she got a bit bigger.
Baby,5.0,Happy Baby (:!,My 5 month old just loves it he started jumping on it less than 15 minutes he loves the music and colors he fell in love with the red parrot bird he just stares At it and smiles my son is one happy baby on this(:
Baby,4.0,Works almost perfectly,Easy to set up and use but a good WIFi connection is necessary for it to work properly. Battery life is very limited (less than one hour) so bring the power cord whenever using away from home.
Baby,5.0,Sir Prance Alot,Just love this. So colorful and will surely keep little ones happy and busy.They will enjoy playing with this toy.
Baby,5.0,Lifesaver!,"My daughter wouldn't  take any other pacifier, so after some research I found the Wubbanub! She loves the nipple shape and although shes still too young to really hold the monkey, having it there keeps it in her mouth better."
Baby,5.0,Leak proof,"It does what it says.  My avent bottles are travel ready with these discs.<br /><br />If you have Avent bottles, these are a must."
Baby,5.0,The Best Twin Tool,"I bought one for each of my boys and I am SO very happy I found these. Trying to manage both babies is hard but they quickly learned ( at 4 months)  to take hold of the animals and easily keep track of them. I am about to buy 2 more, because I will be in big trouble if I loose one. I highly recommend for parents of multiples."
Baby,5.0,Great Product,This is product is so useful if you find yourself sticking items into the hood of your childs stroller. So practical for everything from keys to bottles to wipes etc.
Baby,4.0,Fits my stroller,It attaches with velcro so it will fit anywhere.  You could even use it on a grocery cart as a cup holder for the kid.
Baby,1.0,doesn't work for android users,"Sadly, the promise of this device, which seems to work on on an idevice, has never worked well on my android cell phone. The app has been updated several times since we've bought this device, but invariably the app will stick in &#34;connecting&#34; mode forever. The two times it did work, it froze after 30 seconds."
Baby,5.0,This is SO worth Buying,"I went back and forth for probably a year on whether or not to buy a stroller organizer.  Boy am I glad I finally got one, especially this one.  It's awesome! We have been using it on our Maclaren stroller and it fits really well.  It hangs nicely and isn't in the way at all.  Plenty of room for sunglasses, phones etc in the center compartment.  We fit a Camelback water bottle and a venti Starbucks cup in the drink compartments today.  Get yours now, don't waste time looking and deciding like I did!!!!"
Baby,4.0,a little snug but seats baby well,"My daughter love love loves her bouncy! she is fascinated with all of the sounds, the colors and the movement she gets. She spends at least 20 mins , 2 times a day sometimes in it and it wears her out. I love to see her little legs bouncing like crazy.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars but I think the seat is a little snug and she cant rotate it herself with movement even if she tried so we move it when i think she's bored of what's infront of her. Our daughter is in the lower percentile for her weight at 5 1/2 mths and she fits well (there's stills space to grow) into it but I'm not sure how many more months of use we'll have once she starts gaining some chubb."
Baby,5.0,Love Lamaze,"I love all of the Lamaze toys, we have quite a few but I really love this one.  First off my son's name is Logan so that had me sold right there :) and he has a thing for lion toys so this was beyond perfect.  It has this great sound effect in the head that makes it sound like it is purring, it sounds like a ball that rolls around in the head.  Very cute."
Baby,5.0,Great addition to our UB Vista stroller,"This fit our Uppa Baby Vista stroller perfectly. I love the three compartments, especially the insulated drink holders. The quality is good and the price is excellent. I would highly recommend this product!"
Baby,5.0,The Best Purchase,"This is a great purchase.  My son loves to jump in the Jumperoo.  It was easy to put together and it keeps him entertained for at least 20-30 minutes.  I got it for him at 4 months, he is now 9 months (very mobile) and I can still put him in it while I get a quick workout in.  It does take up a lot of space, but it is worth giving up the space.  We will probably break it down in a couple of months and hold on to it for baby #2"
Baby,5.0,Great for active inquisitive babies,"Looking at my grandchildren who use this, I wish they made one my size!  Well designed and constructed. I will recommend to all parents."
Baby,5.0,Keeps baby engaged!,This is a wonderful addition to any stroller or infant car seat. Baby can easily grasp the legs to play/eat them. The velcro at the top has not once come undone to my lil monsters pulls. Also the giraffe is a pleasant face for the baby to look at. I would highly recommend.
Baby,3.0,Teeny tiny seat,"I received my jumparoo just 2 days after I ordered it, which I was thrilled about. I YouTubed the assembly instructions ( I'm a visual learner) the assembly was quite easy. However, my 6 month old is very average sized.. It's really tricky getting him in and out of it. Another thing that could be improved is the seat does not spin very easy. The rollers are really tight not allowing my son to turn around to play with the toys on the other side of the jumper. Great product just a few tweaks."
Baby,5.0,One of the best purchase!,"I LOVE THIS! and my son loves it. I usually don't let him in it more than half an hour because I want him to do more tummy time and interact with me instead but if I wanted to I could let him sit and jump in there for an hour and he would be happy to do so. Thanks to this I can eat, take a quick shower, clean the house etc. We also have the exersaucer but he favors this one. One of the best things we bought! We bought another one for a friend of ours. PS. We went to Babies R Us and they told us that they don't carry this rainforest jumperoo anymore because it's discontinued but in my opinion this model is way better than the new one."
Baby,5.0,Great Product,This is an awesome product. I would recommend it to any one. I can view the monitor anywhere i go and it makes it really convenient to not be limited. My family can also log in and see the baby even though they live a few hours away.
Baby,2.0,Too unstable,"Didn't love it - bought it for my City Mini GT and found that it was too unstable and whenever I went over any bumps, even small ones like sidewalk cracks, if I had coffee in it it would spill. Ended up buying the Britax stroller caddy instead (cheaper than the Baby Jogger one) and it is much better."
Baby,5.0,Good toy,This is one of the only toys my daughter will play with. She has tons of other toys but this is the only one she really took too
Baby,3.0,Odd little thing,"Standard wheelchair - but to get this to work, I had to put it on the hand grips at the back. It doesn't fit well at the arm rest, which is where the loops would logically fit. Adds too much width and blocks reach to wheels. Unless you put it on your lap, which again - isn't ideal."
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,I love it! Easy to assemble- fun for my grand daughter! She loves it and all the noises ! Keeps her busy for quite a while!
Baby,1.0,Don`t like this product,"Product looks great but it`s doesnt work as shown.<br />We were excitedto useitfor our second baby but Product hasn`t work to all. Battery is dead, we received an unsatisfactory response and we have no customer service where to complain and get a real solution to our problem. Another problem or money back. Noone seems to care to help us."
Baby,5.0,great product,Bought as back up for my baby..he loves it.. easy to wash.. paci sewed on good.. good quality. . .
Baby,4.0,Great jumper,Easy to put together and my 6 month old really enjoys all the interactive elements. The song is some what annoying.
Baby,5.0,Good sealing,"I used those to seal my bottles full of breastmilk in the freezer, they are really handy and easy to wash"
Baby,5.0,Owned for two years now and purchasing a second,"Typically I dont post reviews but I am bothered by all of the negative feedback on this product. We keep our monitor plugged in by our sons bed and get uninterrupted monitoring all day and night. Other reviewers seem to get frustrated when something doesnt seem to work right away and spout off a review rather than try to trouble shoot. We had an issue at first where the screen would pulse to black over and over. Turns out that the monitor must be fully opened (which is also mentioned within the user manual). After repositioning, the problem went away. Our house has a great wireless network which works flawlessly. The monitor never cuts out or drops audio or visual. I can mow our lawn over 4G and keep an ear and eye to my son while he naps. Using 4G, the monitor will work for 15 minutes before you have to reconnect. (Not a big deal) We are purchasing a second for our daughter so that we can use our phones and ipad to keep an eye on both bedrooms at once."
Baby,1.0,Won't stay shut. Boo hiss.,"Bought to replace my trusty red Skip Hop wipes container (the one that came included with my changing pad) after it tragically fell in a porta potty. Anyway, this thing sucks. The red disk closure pops off and slides open all the time. Waste of money. Do not buy."
Baby,5.0,Fisher - price Rainforest,My 6 month old daughter absolutely loves it. She enjoys jumping and playing with the toys. I love it and recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Great workout for babies,"My kid loves his jumperoo. I think the first word he started recognizing is jump, because whenever we say jump, he starts jumping in our laps. He gets super excited in his jumperoo and goes on and on until he either sleeps in it or gets bored of it. Its usually the former. He started playing with all the toys int he jumperoo. He figured out how everything works in it. He also aims for the overhanging birds sometimes. We got it when I was watching him alone for a month. i could leave him jumping in it and do all my chores without worrying he would roll somewhere. Now we use it when we are having our meals and he loves playing in it.<br /><br />Highly recommend for active babies and peaceful meals for parents ;)"
Baby,5.0,Just what I neeeded to make my umbrella stroller more useful,"I purchased a relatively cheap umbrella stroller, but with out the cup holder and little tray I found that I was continuing to use my more clunky large stroller even though I wasn't thrilled with its size or weight. I found this very affordable little product that has made my umbrella stroller much more useful. It has a zippered pouch to keep keys, sunglasses or other small items in, an open tray to put snacks for baby, a wallet or phone in and 2 cup holders that fit a standard sized bottle water or a child's sippy cup. All in all, a very nice product for a great price. There are other products similar to this on Amazon but I was hesitant to buy the more expensive ones for the simple fact that they were all more expensive than the stroller it self! I am glad I went with this one in the first place."
Baby,5.0,Love it,I love this organizer. I put it on my Britax b-ready stroller. It holds my 32 oz. water bottle great w/o it tipping over. I love the metal ring that keeps the organizer from flopping over. I ordered a different one from jj childress (?) and it had absolutely NO support! This organizer is also great b/c you can fold up the stroller w/o taking it off.
Baby,3.0,Damaged product,"When I received this item it was on time but damaged.  I contacted the seller, somewhere in China, and they were very helpful and quick in response time.  I was asked to send pictures of the damage and once I did they shipped a new toy and did not ask for the original to be shipped back.  I received the new item in a very timely manner but again it was damaged.  I'm not sure if it is poor quality of the item or trouble during shipping.  There are threads sticking out all over and the stitching on the back of the person is torn and stuffing is coming out.  If the quality had been better I would have been very happy with this item.  It is just as cute as in the picture.  The customer service was fantastic but the product lacked."
Baby,5.0,Just what I wanted,"Love it so much! Bought for my baby at 3 months. He loves it! He doesn't suck on it like he's supposed to, he chews on it, but loves it just the same. I am a very happy customer"
Baby,5.0,colorful and sturdy,Purchased for my 5mth old granddaughter. We got her brother the Little Tykes trampoline and this is so she can jump with him! She loves the activities and has found the butterfly a perfect teether!!
Baby,3.0,Yes and No,"My son enjoys this item but has never been IN LOVE with it as he has with some of his other toys. It's a great place to set him down, especially since now he's walking, but he doesn't stay in it long before desiring to be picked up. Could just be his personality but he's not a needy baby...<br /><br />The other thing about this item is that it's not easy to store or move from room to room.<br /><br />If I could do over I would have bought something different."
Baby,4.0,worthwhile,"Keeps baby entertained, even for 10 minutes makes it worthwhile. Baby likes the bug and ability to sit up and look around at 4 Months"
Baby,1.0,Not great,"We barely used this monitor for 3 months before it took a dump. I returned it and received store credit to purchase another brand. What a waste! I also didnt like how if you installed the app on multiple iphones, anytime you changed the alerts on one device, it updated on everyones device. So my nanny was getting all sorts of noise alerts after she would leave the home for the day."
Baby,5.0,must-have car toy,"seriously. you don't need any other one. except for probably captain calamari, which is the other bright starts toy. these two toys and you are golden. some of the other car toys don't have as interesting enough appendages but these keep the kiddos entertained for a car ride. bought some new ones by some other brand to shake things up but my little one is not impressed."
Baby,5.0,for mom and dad's latte,"awesome for car keys and holding our drinks.<br /><br />let's get to the best part; it's the best, cheapest alternative than the name brand cup holder that your stroller makes. boo ya."
Baby,4.0,Can't Get Her Out of It.,"This is a fabulous toy!  At 5 months old, she fits in it perfectly AND can reach the ground to bounce bounce bounce!  We got it for her because she is a kicker.  Now she can release all the kicking energy she needs to without kicking us or kicking items over.  My only complaint is the chair does not rotate in a circle easily enough for even us.  It doesn't bother us (or her) too much since she only has one favorite part on it....the part with music and flashing lights.  I highly recommend this bouncer/jumper!"
Baby,5.0,Great jumper!,"After an extensive search for jumper for my daughter, I decided to buy this rain forests jumper by Fisher-Price. My baby thoroughly enjoyed her new within one hour after the jumper was assembled. My six month old daughter uses it everyday. It's worth every dollar. This is one of my favorite purchases for my daughter so far. Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,"Great, even for tall babies!","The lowest height was perfect for my son at his four month milestone. He was in the 93rd percentile for height. We only now moved it to the second level at 23 weeks. His thighs do rub from jumping after about fifteen minutes while in a onesie and he is not a chubby baby. Dressing him in shorts before jumping is the easiest solution. He loves the toys and I love how easy it is to store. I am very pleased with this purchase. He now brings himself to a standing position on his own, which I attribute largely to the use of this jumper."
Baby,1.0,don't buy this...Doesn't work,Doesn't even work and can't change out the pacifier which means it can't properly be disinfected. Impossible to boil or wash it.
Baby,5.0,Nice storage,"High quality. Nice storage for a small umbrella stroller!  Good product - can fit 2 drinks, phone, etc. good buy."
Baby,5.0,Jumperoo,Good. My baby loves it. He plays and jumps a lot. He is more active now. Would like to recommend to my other friends
Baby,5.0,For My Joovy Caboose,"Bought this for my Joovy Caboose because it has no parent cupholders. The straps aren't facing the ideal direction, but they are adjustable and it works fine. My older son has to duck under it when he rides in the back, but it doesn't bother him once he's sitting. And I love having a place to put my stuff now!"
Baby,5.0,"Excellent, great buy!",Got this for our daughter when her baby was born. She loves this monitor and can follow the baby's sounds/movements from anywhere( even outside the house) with her smart phone or tablet. Should be a great choice to monitor your babysitter too. USB cable needed.
Baby,5.0,Very fun and very useful!,Needed a jumper for when our little grandson comes to visit so they don't have to pack one.  PERFECT!  Love it!
Baby,5.0,Great for babies at night,These are great for infants at night because they are easy for them to find in the dark. You can wash them in the washer and dry them as well.
Baby,5.0,Very strong,"After several trips to the zoo, carrying two big/heavy cups of soda, I haven't had to readjust the straps at all. It'll also fit two phones, my wallet, and a juice box in the middle compartment"
Baby,1.0,Smells like chemicals,"The smell for this was horrible. It didnt go away for a month. If you dont mind the manufacturing smell, go for it. Otherwise, better to get some other brand that doesnt have the strong smell."
Baby,5.0,6months old just loves it,"I ordered this for my 6 month old cause he already loves bouncing in his doorway bouncer, so I thought he might like something like this. I was right! When he's in it he constantly jumping and laughing, yelling, talking and making all kinds of happy sounds. Defiantly worth it."
Baby,4.0,cute,"this is a gift, yet to be delivered to the baby, but it looks cute and the reviews seem pretty high."
Baby,5.0,Excellent for mummy relief!,"Baby loves to be seated in the jumperoo, and it provides a welcoming relief for mums who are tired from carrying or entertaining their baby all day long. All the stations on the jumperoo are attractive to babies, and once baby can sit up straight, they do take notice of the hanging bird and frog and make a jump for these."
Baby,1.0,Horrible!,The night vision switches on and off constantly.  I also get kicked off the Bluetooth and lose connection to the monitor.  It took Withings customer service almost 3 weeks to respond to my inquiry.  Save your money!
Baby,5.0,Love this monitor!,"My husband and I got this as a gift and we LOVE it! It's very nice to be able to change the music and the lights right on my phone so that I don't have to sneak in while she is sleeping to change something. It's also great to be able to see her sleeping and then zoom in to make sure everything is ok. Could be because I am a first time mom, but SIDS scares me and it's so nice to be able to see her little belly rising at night or during nap time. My husband also likes it because he can check in on her while he's at work. He is currently having trouble linking in on his phone (it's an Android) while at work but I think he just needs to re-sync it. I also like that you can access the monitor from the computer. I just wish you could also change the music and lights from the computer.<br /><br />Something I didn't like, the monitor does randomly disconnect, however I'm pretty sure this has to do with our internet and not the product... we ended up buying a cheap monitor just to use for the sound incase it disconnected at night. It also will stop working if there is a storm and we lose power where as the cheap monitor has a battery life and will keep going. I like having both"
Baby,5.0,Ellie!!!!! Our favorite!!!,"We love this thing!!! First of all...it's adoreable!!!! We have the elephant one - so cute! My son is a wiggler as well, and this helps him coordinate the paci back in his mouth when he knocks it out. I'm a little grosses out by how often he puts the legs and ears in his mouth knowing that it's fallen on the ground more times than I can count - but just read that it's machine washable, so I'm thrilled to pieces!!! I'll definitely be tossing that bad boy in the wash ASAP!!!! :). Great product! Well made! My son wasn't crazy about pacis in general in the beginning, but we just kept this one around (as well as a soothie without the elephant attached) and he's come around (especially now that he's teething!)<br /><br />As for the &#34;I could make this myself&#34;ers... You absolutely could. But by the time you buy the $3 soothie, the $4 plush stuffed animal and figure out whether you should hot glue or sew it... I say just splurge a little. You don't need more than one. Unless you're super crafty and you have everything lying around anyway, we'll then go for it! ;)"
Baby,5.0,Wonderful for Your Bicycle,"I use this to carry my water bottle, phone, keys, etc. when bike riding.  Very easy to attach and detach and serves this purpose very well!  A lot cuter than adding a big old bulky basket to the bike and you can attach this to the inside of the handlebars, which it makes it very accessible when on the move."
Baby,5.0,Amazing,My daughter is obsessed with it. Its absolutely amazing. A must by for all newborns. Highly recommended to all of my friends.
Baby,1.0,Dries out the wipes,"Save your money. This case dries out the baby wipes, and it's a bulky case. It's actually bigger than the package the wipes come in, (we use The Honest Co. wipes), so we just carry an extra pack instead of using this case."
Baby,4.0,"complicated at first, but nice after a while","I had some difficulties with setup, but now that we are used to it, it works quite well. The images are pretty crisp, and I was delighted to discover it often works well via cellular network when I'm at work and my wife is home. The white noise features come in handy too.    Here are the pain-in-the-necky things:  - The manual is incomplete, and it's not intuitive to figure out the full feature set. It resembles an Apple product only in that it is white ;)  - It sometimes drops wifi connection, but it gets it back pretty fast.   - The camera doesn't pivot, so you've got to futz with the placement till it's where you want it.   - The whole thing just needed to be put through some actual parent testing before it was brought to market. If they had given it to harried, tired parents-of-newborns and used a stopwatch and a frustration-gauge, they would have recognized it needed a little more development time.     The best thing this unit has going for it is that there isn't a better one out there."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful toy,I bought two of these.  One for my six month old granddaughter and one for my five month old grandson.  They both love this toy!  It has become their favorite.  I highly recommend it!
Baby,3.0,Bought & never used,"Don't really need them. The nipples don't leak during travel, so I never used these. One of those new mom things you buy and then later are like that was silly."
Baby,5.0,One happy baby here!,My daughter is in love with this toy! I actually get time to clean now lol the only down fall is the weight limit. It only goes to 20Lbs and my 4mo old is 18lbs. Already. I am happy about the purchase all around.
Baby,3.0,OK product,I like the idea but the product but some thing have to be done with the closing system it tooooo weak
Baby,5.0,jumpee,"I purchased this for my grandson because his cousin had one a couple of years ago, and he nearly wore it out!!  He is not quite 5 months old, so, it has taken a while for him to get the hang of it. I think this is mainly because the straps won't lower enough for his feet to touch the floor. His parents put a yoga pillow underneath, but, I think he will enjoy it more when he gets a bit longer. He seems to love the toys and gizzmos and keeps entertained batting at those ."
Baby,5.0,baby jumper,My wife and I bought this for our granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. And its easy to take apart to transport  if you need to.
Baby,5.0,Wubbanub Love,"I have bought these for all three of my boys. I liked that the nipple is similar to a real one which I felt helped with breast feeding. As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning. When the kids are at the pint of giving up the pacifier (down to naps only) I cut off the nipple end and let them hold on to the toy. In a day or two they are done with pacifiers with little fuss."
Baby,5.0,Best baby jumper/bouncer,"Adjustable for different heights, so many activities and sounds, wonderful exercise and the best entertainment for your baby.  Your baby will never be bored with the Jumperoo."
Baby,1.0,Withings does not work on Android as advertised,"Withings smart baby monitor advertises its ability to work with IOS and Android. With Android you would download the app from the play store.  The problem is if you have any of the latest android OS's on your smart phone or tablet the app video monitor rarely ever connects.  It has problems on Android 4.4.2 I can attest to.  Also I have not owned the product for more than 7 months and the power adapter micro usb connector continues to easily fall out of the back of the unit.  It appears to stretch the socket from use and then it is hard to make contact and actually get the unit to stay powered on.  A major disappointment since this unit has good features but what good is it, if it does not work.  I would not recommended this product to anyone since it has quality issues."
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!!,My 7 month kid was so happy to get this! She loves it and plays with it all the time when we are away from home.
Baby,4.0,Good but the seat is a little small,"It is good overall. My eight-month son loves its music and jump every day. Yet, the seat is little small. My son could not stay for long time."
Baby,5.0,A+,My son LOVES this jumperoo. My only complaint is that he's getting to big for it! Would buy again in a minute@
Baby,5.0,Will Recommend,"No complaints, would recommend this product.  The fabric portion is easy to remove for washing and easy to re-install.  Adjustable heights that are easy to work.  Easy assembly.  My child really liked it."
Baby,5.0,excelente,I use these with the Natural bottles and have had no issues with leakage so far. There is no reason to buy Classic bottle lids to use these.
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"My 11week old is mesmerised by the motion of this mobile, i love unique action and choice of 3 different musics and 1 sound effect, the remote is really handy too"
Baby,5.0,Satisfied with the product,excellent quality product. Recommended 100% to the entire community. The product is as described. Therefore I give it 5 stars.
Baby,3.0,Dries wipes!! :(,"Works ok as a wipes case, but I'm sure there are better models out there, this doesn't seal completely and hence it dries wipes."
Baby,5.0,Our little one loves it!,"We weren't going to do the whole pacifier thing with our breastfed baby, but the hospital photographer showed us how well these Soothies worked and it was hard to argue with results. Our little one found suckling to be very soothing, but we soon found out she'd scream and squawk whenever she tossed the pacifier out of her mouth.<br /><br />The Wubbanub:<br /><br />1. Made her less likely to toss the pacifier onto the floor.<br />2. Protected the pacifier from actually touching the floor when she did throw it out.<br />3. Gave her a cute stuffed animal to touch, hold, and hug.<br /><br />I buy Wubbanubs for shower gifts for all my friends and family now."
Baby,5.0,Baby shower Saturday,Its cute and I hope that it will work for the new baby in August. The babys room is baby jungle animals
Baby,5.0,cute and multifunctional...,"I love Lamaze toys in general. I think this company makes high quality and well designed toys and offers them at fair prices. This is how my little one entered the world of toys. We have dee-dee dragon, captan calamari, octopus and various other small soft toys from lamaze. We put them close to my son's bed a few weeks after he was born. You can also attach them to the crib or the stroller using the top white circle which is a plus.<br /><br />It took a month or so for my son to show interest to these colorful toys. This is probably because of the fact that newborns can only see, black-white and red properly until they get a few months old. But after that he really enjoyed playing with this one and the other lamaze toys. There are many different colors and each part feels different to touch (rough, smooth, squeaky or fluffy...) Besides it has a rattle (the purple ball like thing it holds). So it offers audiovisual plus tactile stimulation.<br /><br />For proper brain development, experts recommend offering as many age-appropriate stimulus as you can and that helps smooth integration to the surrounding world too. Apart from the rattle bit and the white circular bit, which is rounded,  there is no hard plastic, so it is very unlikely that a baby can hurt himself while playing with that.<br /><br />It is easy to clean and it should be cleaned often. I have tried surface rubbing with vinegar for routine cleaning and besides that every once in a few months I put it in washing machine (inside a T-shirt or sweater) and I have not experienced any damages at all (I have High efficency machine).<br /><br />There are toys, one would like to keep it as memorabilia of his/her baby's first days, this one can be a good candidate for that spot."
Baby,5.0,Works great,"I bought this to go on my Baby Jogger City Mini since it doesn't come with a parent cup holder or tray of any sort and everyone knows you need someplace to put &#34;your&#34; stuff too.<br />This add on basket/holder is not too expensive and works great.  The Velcro straps are plenty long enough to work any stroller handle, it has a semi-ridge wire around the top and bottom so it doesn't collapse when you put stuff in it, even my insulated 21oz water bottle fits just fine and I don't feel like it's going to fall out or pull loose from the stroller.  It has a small zippered area for your phone or other small stuff you might want to keep secure. It's large enough to put plenty of stuff in to have right at hand, but not so much that it gets in the way.<br />The best part is that I can keep it on my stroller when I fold it, one less thing to worry about having to take apart and lose."
Baby,5.0,Super Cute!,"I absolutely adore the Lamaze toys!  Dee Dee is the fourth or fifth in Lamaze toy in our collection and she's just as sweet as the others.  Our two month old is at the point where she's looking but not yet really touching toys, but the colorful Lamaze toys seem to catch her attention.  I can't wait until she is able to discover all the different sounds and textures on her own!"
Baby,3.0,"Not what I expected, but baby loves it","I bought this paci for a few reasons. I thought the animal attached would keep it from getting knocked too far away from baby, and he could get back in his mouth easier. I also thought when he spit it out and I was holding him, it would be easier to catch that most pacis. Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly. Baby loves it a lot though and loves to just hold it even when he doesn't want to suck on it, so for that I don't regret buying it at all."
Baby,1.0,New item showed up already associated to another user,"I own other Withings products which i love, but am frustrated with this purchase as the new item that showed up was in good condition, but obviously had been returned as the battery was already inserted into the unit and upon trying to configure the unit it is already associated with some other withings user account and as such it will not let me add the unit to my account without knowing that email address and disassociating it with the previously configured account.<br /><br />Upon trying to contact withings I come to find there is no phone number to contact, only email support!  Hopefully they respond quickly or I will be returning this product and purchasing something else!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just wanted to update that Withings was quick to respond via email and helped reset the device on their side once I provided them with proof of purchase of the particular unit.<br /><br />That said, I had very mixed results in trying to use this unit for baby monitoring locally.  It wasn't very stable for streaming even when plugged directly into an ethernet port. Honestly for audio monitoring I found a plain cheap audio monitor to be much more reliable and with a much longer battery life than using a phone. For video monitoring I ended up returning this unit and picked up a foscam ip camera for half the price which works great for direct connection without a trip to a remote server and with the ability to pan and tilt to get a better view that what I could get with the placement of the Withings unit.<br /><br />As a pay it forward , I did disassociate the baby monitor from my withings account before returning it! Good luck to the next person that gets it."
Baby,1.0,"AVOID WITHING PRODUCTS! WARNING, WARNING!!!","This baby monitor was a total waste of money.  Not only was the product (baby monitor) a lousy piece of equipment with constant connection issues and clarity inconsistencies, one-year after owning this crappy monitor it stopped working altogether.  $250.00 for one year of frustration.  The worst part about owning anything by Withing is there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  There is not a phone number to call, email to communicate<br />through or technical support to ask questions...you buy from Withing and it is a gamble; will it work properly and if something goes wrong who can I call.  The answer is NOBODY.<br />S##T OUT OF LUCK! I have tried to send a complaint through their website but my email gets kicked back, intentionally.  I GIVE WIRTHING AN &#34;F&#34; on every level but especially on customer service."
Baby,4.0,nice,MY SON LOVE IT!  the volume is very low but he dont care hes only 10 months he just wont to eat the mouth piece lol.
Baby,5.0,Great jumper!,My 8 month old loves this jumper. He has been using it for months now and it keeps him very occupied. ;)
Baby,5.0,works very well,I love this whole Avent system of being able to do everything in one bottle without transferring my pumped milk. These work well on the Avent natural bottles they seal so well I can even freeze the milk in the bottle I haven't had any issue with leaking of any kind they work very well
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Got this for my 4 month old son, he loves pacis, and I love monkeys for him. This was perfect. I do suggest washing it before using because it was a bit dusty. Which is understandable."
Baby,4.0,its great,no problems with it. Does what it suppose to. Already at 4 months my son is almost ready for the 3 (last) setting on the spring despite barely being able to hold up his head with confidence.
Baby,5.0,snuggly toy,Bought one for back up . Love the size me granddaughter can play with this toy weather on the bouncer or just in the playpen.
Baby,2.0,Doesn't fit on angled handles of an umbrella stroller.,"The actual item is fine. It is well made but doesn't fit on the handles of an umbrella stroller. It would only fit if the handles were horizontal, not angled. My complaint is strictly on the description of the item which didn't advise this design issue. Alternately, it would take only a small design change to accommodate different angles of handle (like a grommet that would allow it to spin relative to the velcro straps).  I gave it away."
Baby,5.0,Great add on for Britax b-agiles!,perfect little add on! Love my strollers 10x more with this handy thing on them! Fits so much and multiple pockets are handy!!
Baby,5.0,Smiles on my grandson's face....says it all,"Makes my grandson smile from ear to ear, he loves it. Great That smile of his is worth a thousand words."
Baby,5.0,Love this!,"My son's only &#34;lovey.&#34; Great quality, super cute. Just wish there was a way to remove the pacifier without cutting it off. We are eventually going to need to wean our son from the pacifier part, but would still like to keep the monkey around since it's his security item."
Baby,5.0,Must have,My little girl loves her wubbanub. Best thing made by far. I highly recommend these to everyone. The owl one is really cute as well.
Baby,2.0,Ok. Simple as that.,"Not horrible. Not great. I don't like that there isn't enough settings as my little one is 16 lbs and is unable to even come close to touching the ground. One part is defective...as the dragonfly is as limp as old men pre viagra. Its just average. I would not pay more than $50 for this ever. Get it used if you really want it.<br /><br />Edit. Fisher Price emailed me back after inquiry. Apparently the dragonfly is supposed to be limp. What is interesting, is every picture I see including the one on this site shows the item in question upright. It is impossible to stand upright. This is clearly misleading and I am lowering my score to 2/5. Do not buy unless you just really want this thing. Better, cheaper options available."
Baby,5.0,My sons LOVED and LOVE these,"My sons LOVED and LOVE these, and have since birth.  Ingenious idea and highly recommend!  My 15 month old uses at bedtime for both his pacifier and his &#34;lovie&#34;"
Baby,1.0,red button cheap,"I bought this because I thought it would be a wipes case that I could use one handed while changing diapers.  Not so much. Also, the red button doesn't click, so it doesn't really close/lock.  And then soon after it just fell off."
Baby,2.0,cups dont fit right and if your going to the ...,cups dont fit right and if your going to the mall and eat out the cups wont fit at all unless you cram them in and then hope you dont get thirsty and have to pull it out again
Baby,5.0,Works well.,Works well.
Baby,5.0,yay,you can lose with wubanub.
Baby,5.0,5 Stars,"I bought this for my newest nephew, knowing my oldest nephew adored his, and had quite the collection, so far he loves it!"
Baby,4.0,Tons of fun!,I got this for my son when he was 4 months old and he loved it right away! He is now 8 months and doesn't want to be confined but it was a great product in it's heyday!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 9 month old loves this activity toy.
Baby,5.0,Works Great,"We have a City Select and this works great!  Holds drinks, phones, whatever.  For the price, you can't beat it!"
Baby,2.0,Cute but Impractial,"I love how adorable these are and that they are attached to the pacifier sent home with us from the hospital but I was really disappointed to find out there is no way to separate the two. Separating them may not seem like a big deal, I understand it a safety thing, but until you get a bout of thrush and need to disinfect anything and everything that has ever touched the inside of your child's mouth this then becomes totally impractical."
Baby,4.0,I was very happy with this product,"My daughter was 4 months when she started using this she has been able to hold her self upright since 3 months and was always wanting to kick and move her feet. She was a little small when I first used this but she loved it from the beginning. The only thing i would say is this is a larger item, I have a 15x20 living room and this works just fine but if you have a small space this is no space saver, and it is hard to move around an between standard doorways as the base is larger. Great product overall it has a nice softer music feature which I love."
Baby,1.0,Waste of money if you're a Android user!,"Really disapointed...<br />Withings is clearly focused on apple devices and despite the annoucement of android support the baby monitor won't work in Kit Kat enviroment.<br />It's clear that this kind of product is related to baby's health and security, and Withings support should be aware of any issues KIT Kat may cause.<br />Unfortunatelly, it seems that they simply don't care if you're a android user and the baby monitor stop working after the OS upgrade.<br />To increase the problem, once you upgraded to Kit Kat there is no way back to older android version.<br />Needless to say that my monitor is useless until Withings decide to upgrade the software.<br />Can't afford that much waiting... buying another brand....<br />If you're not a Iphone or Ipad user just stay away from this expensive (and now useless) product."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great stroller/car seat toy! Lots of textures and things to look at.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves it!!!
Baby,5.0,great product,My infant really shows interest in this toy. He is most interested in the face which he can't reach in the stroller but that is the only downfall I can think of. Cheap and arrived on time.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful!,"Best buy ever. I have a high energy baby that hardly naps (maybe 2-3 naps of 30 minutes, if I'm lucky). So coming up with activities that will keep her interested is tough. The jumperoo keeps her on her feet for a long time! The only bad part, if it can be called that, is that baby now expects to jump wherever she is and if she's upright. :)"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love it, bubs loves it.  Super quality and shipping quickly.  Very happy customer."
Baby,2.0,Hard to turn and get into.,Seat for the Jumperoo is difficult to turn. Our 6 month old couldn't possible turn it on their own. The leg hole is the seat are also small making it difficult to get the baby in to it. Our other brand jumper is much easier to use.
Baby,5.0,Excellent purchase,My 5 month old daughter LOVES this. Best purchase yet!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect storage for keys/cell phone/drinks.
Baby,3.0,It is really just okay,"I was excite to get this product and still am, but it certainly wasn't all that I expected. I did not notice any horrifying smell as other stated- nothing more horrific than typical junk everyone buys from China. Ooops- this one is from China too, so there should be no surprise there IF your buggy ended up smelling.<br /><br />I find the main part of buggy organizer pretty well made and sturdy- the wire around the top gives it a nice finish. Red thread and sign looks good- almost gives it a reasonably expensive look. My issue with this product and the main reason why it received 3 out of 5 starts, are straps. The threading from those come off- almost as if it needed a stitch around versus just through and through. Also, these straps obviously wont help you if your stroller has a handle that is at an angle. I have Mamas and Papas Armadillo stroller and the handle is at an angle and its not adjustable. That is not buggy design's fault, but even if the handle was perfectly perpendicular to the ground, the straps seem to be too flimsy to give this organizer a somewhat sturdier placement. It just sort of dangles and looks out of place."
Baby,5.0,my baby goes crazy in this jumparoo. loves the ...,my baby goes crazy in this jumparoo.  loves the discovery aspect of moving certain items and making the sounds go off.  only gripe is the top rainforest pieces with the frog and parrot fall off often.
Baby,5.0,Amazing jumperoo!!,"In the beginning I was about to return it, as my daughter hated it. But I tired giving it a few days, so glad I did, because now she loves it so much that could spend up to an hour jumping in it. It has so many different things to keep your LO entertained and busy, giving mommy a well deserved break."
Baby,5.0,Great jumper,"My 8 month old jumps himself to sleep in this jumper. It has just the right amount of interactive toys for the baby to explore, the music isn't too loud even on the highest setting, and it seems very sturdy for my guy & his rough bouncing."
Baby,5.0,Great toy,The best friend of my baby.
Baby,4.0,Gives you some free hands,Keeps my 7 months old occupied for 10 to15 min at the time. Only when she's in good mood.
Baby,5.0,a must for any baby,"really fun toy for the baby.  he loves to jump in our arms and its very tiring to bounce him.  This was perfect solution, strap him in and he goes nuts in it and great way to wear him down.  burns off the energy and than is ready for nap."
Baby,3.0,Works great if it is on the IP address,"Works great if it is on the IP address, but I could not enable it when away from our home or the wireless signal. The app is great, but APPLE did not support it. I am still trying to see if it works when I am traveling!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I have this for my baby jogger and it's AWESOME! I wish I had bought it sooner!
Baby,5.0,Toy,My grandson's favorite toy. Reasonably priced and shipped quickly.
Baby,5.0,Great cheap option for our Baby Jogger,"Cheapest option I found, and gets the job done!  Very sturdily made and resistant to stains."
Baby,5.0,Your child's next favorite tool,"My son loved this toy so much, I had to order two more, just to be sure there was one at the house, one in his bag, and one in reserve. I found he chewed on the legs and tail as much as the pacifier. I ended up putting the whole thing in the dishwasher and then letting it air dry to ensure that it was clean and sanitary. It's been more than a year since I purchased my first one, and my son still loves it."
Baby,3.0,Kind of a pain and only a little but useful.,"This is SUCH a good idea. It works so well when it works, and for that I would give it 5 stars. However, it has some very real issues inherent in its design that you should know going in if you decide to purchase.<br /><br />1. The baby monitor is only as strong as your wireless signal. If you plan to use it while you're working out in the yard or in the basement, and your signal isn't very strong in those areas, this might not be your best bet. Otherwise be prepared to spend even more money to boost your router with a range extender to get the coverage you need.<br /><br />2. Even in close proximity with good signal, the device disconnects frequently, and doesn't make it obvious to you on your phone that it has done so, failing to reconnect. (Unless you're sitting there using your phone.)<br /><br />3. The battery doesn't last long at all. Whenever we put our daughter down for a nap in a different area of the house and have set this up to run on battery, it only lasts about 10-15 minutes before it dies completely.<br /><br />4. Cellular coverage doesn't last long either. Theoretically this would be an ideal backup for those out-of-range areas if you're working out in the yard, for it to connect via your cellular network. And theoretically, it does this. However, it'll only keep you connected for 10 minutes that way, so this is not a sustainable option if your babe is taking a long nap and you've got gardening to do or another project outside of the house.<br /><br />All in all, we do use it. We're stubborn iphone users and having made this purchase I'm not in a hurry to replace it with something else for a second device to have to carry around. I have to believe Withings could improve some of these features, though, to make for a more seamless user experience. As it is, it's kind of a pain and only a little but useful."

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excellent buy. My 4 month old Grandson really loves it. It is durable yet lite enough to move around.
Baby,5.0,the perfect stroller bag,"Works perfectly with my Baby Jogger City Mini. Very spacious, and I don't have to take it off to fold up the stroller. I can fit two 75 oz camelback water bottles, my wristlet, phone, keys, and snack container for my daughter, which is everything I need. I can easily lay the seat down with it attached too, so I don't have to worry about that either. Love it!"
Baby,4.0,Very good!,"Excellent! The product was delivered exactly at the expected time. Meet my expectations, it worked perfectly."
Baby,4.0,Not high enough..,"Its all great and everything, w the exception that my 6mo old(27&#34; & 20lbs) is now too tall for this. :( she got to use it for 3mo only..."
Baby,4.0,My four month old son loves this toy so much ...,"My four month old son loves this toy so much. I saw in some of the other reviews that some people were unsatisfied with the size, but I have no complaints. My son was almost 11 pounds at birth he is gigantic & he loves it he stays entertained enough not to roll or military crawl away. I ultimately bought it because it was made in the US however while putting it together I noticed that parts of it were made in China, that's my only complaint."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These discs work well with avent products. They also fit in my Lansinoh bottles.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Beautiful, loved"

I bought two of these monitors because they better integrate with my apple ecosystem.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"All Lamaze toys have been fun, colorful and entertaining for our little one."
Baby,3.0,I've decided to go with this jumper due to the ...,"I've decided to go with this jumper due to the high rating. However, my 5 month old doesn't appear to be enjoying/liking as much. Not all the babies react the same so this is understandable.  I wished it had more toys on it to be played with."
Baby,5.0,"Cute and ""busy"" toy!","My grandson, who is 1, was sooo excited when he opened this gift!!  It is quite colorful and has lots of fun things to focus on.<br />I bring it when we go on our walks and he doesn't get bored with is like some simpler toys."
Baby,5.0,Amazon is the place to shop!!!!,"This was a gift .Baby is not due until end of August. So it's use can not be reviewed right now. However,It was received on time .Pricing was great and i would order again through Amazon.It has been a wonderful experience getting our first grandchild's essentials<br />Thank you so much for all you do to bring savings to consumer's."
Baby,3.0,Does the job,Impedes folding of stroller
Baby,5.0,Absolutely love this product and so does our little girl,Absolutely love this product and so does our little girl. She knows its hers and uses it as her chew toy too!
Baby,5.0,Fun for baby (and for parents)!,"My son had one of these when he was an infant and we bought another for our daughter when she was about four months old. Both of them enjoyed this jumper very much, happily bouncing and flinging themselves around with obvious joy. It's a lot of fun for parents to watch too, and gets lots of laughs. I like that it's easy to clean and gives a baby exercise as well as giving parents a break to do some chores nearby. I could do without the somewhat annoying music, but it seems to appeal to babies!<br /><br />My only complaint is that if your child is small, like both of mine were, they may not be able to reach the ground even at the lowest setting when they are otherwise ready to use this. Both had to have pillows crammed into the circular base so they could jump until they grew into it.<br /><br />Pricey, but worth it."
Baby,5.0,Great toy!!,My son absolutely loves his little giraffe! This actually one of his favorite toys. It keeps him busy!
Baby,3.0,"Works, but not worth it.","Works well on iPhones and iPads, with a very easy setup for these devices. However, it is almost impossiible (could't make it) to have it send the images over the internet for watching outside my home network. Configuration outside Apple devices is very hard. Stopped using it after two months since I set up several cameras and a DVR at home. Now I watch them anywhere and also am able to record the video."
Baby,1.0,Loud motor,Motor is really loud and music is way too quiet.
Baby,5.0,Keeps baby happy,"Baby loves this. Purchased when he was 3 months and he still plays with it at 5 months. Every time we get in the car he picks it up and plays with it. We used to have it on the stroller but took it off because the sun kept reflecting off the mirror into his eyes. Other than that, it's been absolutely perfect and a great help to keeping car rides peaceful and quiet."
Baby,5.0,Best jumper- my son loves it!,"My son absolutely loves this jumper! I did a lot of research before purchasing this and I now see why this is the top rated jumper. The lights, music and various activity centers on it keep my son occupied and highly entertained.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what age would be best for this as it isn't stated, but I would say it really can't be used until your child can fully support his head. I tried it with my son around 4 months and put a pillow behind him but he was still a little too unsupported. Now at five months, and being able to fully support himself, he is loving it! It is absolutely hilarious to watch him laugh and jump all over the place! It has three levels so it can be adjusted as your child grows. Very happy with this purchase."
Baby,5.0,Great baby item to have,"Great item to keep baby occupied, learning and exercised.  Our daughter loves it.  She mostly uses the toy in the center that makes sounds and plays songs when activated.  It's fun to see her get so much enjoyment from bouncing up and down too."
Baby,4.0,"Ok, but look elsewhere.","4 starts for function but I wouldn't purchase it again!<br />After reading the review on this I was sold! However, our neighbors gave us their used jumpy and I like theirs much better.<br />This rainforest one plays an instrumental song over and over while the used one we received plays the ABC's and actually has words.  I wouldn't get this one again, I'd look for words and more activities for little one to play with."
Baby,5.0,Love this thing,Love this thing. Did not have it w/ my first daughter but I wished I did. My 6 month old really enjoy this!!!
Baby,5.0,I thought this would be a good compromise and I was right,"I bought this for my granddaughter. I have the standard jolly jumper in my home, but my daughter doesn't have the room in her apartment. I thought this would be a good compromise and I was right. This fits and preforms well in a small space. The baby has a blast in both, maybe a bit more in this one as it has toys for her to play with that won't fall off. If you are on the hedge of buying this, I would say go for it!"
Baby,5.0,A perfect addition to any collection,Wubbanubs are my go to baby gift! They are so much easier for a baby to hold compared to a regluar pacifier.
Baby,5.0,Great infant toy for stroller/car seat/activity gym,"Bought this for my 2nd baby when at 3 months old, I realized that she didn't have any toys (we got rid of all our baby toys since we were only planning on having 1 kid). It seemed like a reasonable choice given the price.... and she loves it! We've attached it as an extra toy to her activity gym and used it in her stroller and her car seat (even though I know you're not supposed to hang toys from the car seat while driving - occasionally a giraffe leg will smack her in the face but she doesn't seem to mind). She loves the little mirror and the rings that hang from the legs. Keeps her entertained and happy so mama is happy too. :)"
Baby,5.0,which is the most adorable thing. I think this in a way helps ...,"This mobile does what it suppose to do, it keeps my baby interested and she started pressing the button and control the music ever since she learnt how to keep her head up. I noticed my baby actually enjoys it more after she can stand, she now stands up and pulls and plays with the animals. She would go turn on the music herself before going to sleep, she learnt which song each button plays, she never press the green one cause it plays the sound of jungle instead of music, which is the most adorable thing. I think this in a way helps the baby's intellectual developments as well. One interesting thing I founds about is, the remote controls other fish-and-price mobiles too. I used to put two for her, this one, and another one with glowing animals that plays soothing sleeping music. I can control both of them using the remote that came with this one, lol."
Baby,4.0,Works on my double stroller,"Most of the reviews seemed to use this on an umbrella type stroller, so I was a bit skeptical to try on my Baby Jogger GT City Mini double.  However, it works well.  I gave it 4 stars though because the velcro aligns UNDER the handle bar, so the organizer itself has to tip in order to put water bottles in it because they won't fit straight under.  (I don't think this would be an issue if it was on an umbrella stroller or any stroller that had 2 handles on the side vs a handle bar)<br />I do like that it has spots for 2 cups and a center area for other things.  I use it for cell phone and keys.  There is also a mesh zippered pocket that is nice for cash or something small you want secured.  On our daily walks I have a water bottle and cell phone in it, but on trips to the zoo and parks I stick our membership card & a few bucks in the zipped pocket and then load it up with a water bottle, sippy, cell phone & snacks.  So far, so good!"
Baby,3.0,Watch figures,Kid loves it but figures get stuck in it.
Baby,1.0,One Star,Product dosnt way open and barley fits a cup
Baby,5.0,Cute,Arrived in a timely manner . this is sooooo cute especially in person !
Baby,5.0,"The best, most economical stroller organizer.","The whole thing is a sturdy, black fabric, so it's so soft and does not impede folding of stroller.<br />The two cup holders, one on either side are also made of fabric so that they are flexible and you can put something larger in the large middle compartment just by collapsing one of both of the cup holders.  There is also a zippered pouch in the large middle compartment for credit card or cash.  Looks great and is highly functional.  I bought two, one for my City Mini and one for my Summer 3D travel umbrella stroller.<br /><br />Another reviewer posted a list of all the strollers this is compatible with."
Baby,5.0,They are delighted!,My daughter is expecting her first child and this is the monitor they wanted.  They are delighted!
Baby,5.0,Great Jumper!,"I am so sorry that our granddaughter is outgrowing this! She loves it so much we don't even mind the music! She does enjoy some of the toys on it, but mostly just likes to jump!"
Baby,5.0,can't live without!,Our 3 month old loves it! in just a couple of weeks we have noticed her coordination improve your legs stronger as well as her neck and everybody.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my nephew a few of these and loves them
Baby,5.0,Worked well!,Very handy to have on the stroller. We purchased this for a rental stroller (Double CITI Mini jogging stroller) that we knew would not have cupholders or storage in the handle. This worked out very well and have since added to our regular stroller at home in addition to the built in cupholders and small storage compartment that it has. I can see future uses for it when the girls outgrow the stroller as well. Quite versatile!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is so fun and entertaining!
Baby,5.0,They fit,"I love being able to pump, store, and freeze milk right in the bottle I'll be using to feed my baby. They fit the classic Avent bottles and the new natural style."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Just as described. Prevents leakage when shaking a bottle.
Baby,5.0,Baby loved everything about it,Our baby loved it and was an early fixture in the co-sleeper
Baby,1.0,One Star,It didn't work for me. I sent it back.
Baby,5.0,My LO loves it!! ordered it a while ...,"My LO loves it!! ordered it a while back and it is still standing after all the pulling, kicking and going crazy on it :-)"
Baby,5.0,Great for the money!,I didn't want to pay $30 for the baby jogger parent consol so I tried this one and I love it!! Fits our baby jogger city mini GT perfectly. Can easily be removed and love that it has a little zipper closure to tuck away more valuable items like phones or keys.
Baby,4.0,... bounciness but the toys on it are not as good as the Sassy one,My 5 month old loves this one for its bounciness but the toys on it are not as good as the Sassy one.  She prefers that one at her age because there are more toys to chew on.  This one does not have the best chew toys.
Baby,5.0,Baby and mommy love it!,"My baby loves this!  I bought this for her when she was 4 months old.  When she first started using it, she was a bit small so we put a pillow underneath her feet.  For the most part she just sort of looked at the flashing lights and occasionally licked the seat fabric.  She was usually content for about 10-15 minutes at a time at 4 months old.  Now at 9 months old she is a bouncing machine.  I put her in it every morning while I eat breakfast and she is usually happy bouncing for about 25-30 minutes!  Enough time for me to eat and get some coffree (YAY).<br /><br />At 9 months, we still have it on the lowest height setting, so she still has tons of room to grow with this.  My baby is about 25% for height and about 5% for weight (I am not sure if heavier babies would pull this down more or not).  We tried bumping it up to the middle height setting, but her feet were just barely touching the ground, so we put it back down to the lowest for a little longer."
Baby,5.0,very handy,Very nice. Bought it to go on an adult trike. Works well. Added some gems and my friend LOVES it.
Baby,5.0,Good,my baby loves it. Good seller
Baby,5.0,Great Buy,"This was a great buy! Love that the height is adjustable to grow with the little one. She loves the variety of things to play with and jumps up a storm. Also, very easy to machine wash the seat cover and wipe down the plastic!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy,Great toy
Baby,1.0,Overpriced,"Way over priced, this is available for much less else where."
Baby,5.0,"The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.",Excellent product and a good price!
Baby,5.0,Love it,"This is great for the price. I have two strollers and each one has one of these. It attaches easily with the Velcro and folds up easy with the britax b agile. I also have it for extra storage on my uppababy glite although with an umbrella close you do have to loosen one strap to close it fully Because of the metal part holding it's shape but that's what makes it work well.  No big deal . It's great for the price and holds what you need it to, drinks, phone, toys, wipes whatever....."
Baby,5.0,love,"so cute, love it"
Baby,5.0,Very entertaining!,Our three month old LOVES sitting and jumping in his jumperoo!  He loves to kick his legs and this is the perfect toy for our active baby.
Baby,4.0,Logan the Lion,Logan the Lion was just as pictured.  Colorful and great attachment to stroller
Baby,2.0,Just okay,"It's okay. I think it's cheaply made. It works fine but it's just cheaply done. Plus, the colors are so obnoxious. I saw the colors in the photos of course, but once you take it out, it was like an assault on my vision.<br />It takes up a HUGE foot print in our home, so if you don't have space, absolutely do not buy this!"
Baby,5.0,best item bought for my big boy,"My 5 month old loves the jumperoo.  He is 18lbs and 27 inches.  Had to raise it to the 2nd level (Very easy). Also, added a foam square to protect his feet from pounding the tile floors.  We have my so  wear his shoes while jumping because he tends to curl his toes.<br /><br />Assembly was a snap.  Wife had to help me with seat cover. Took use abot 30 min. Highly recommend if you have the room for it. Can be a bit bulky."
Baby,5.0,Would purchase again!,I have the britax be ready stroller and this organizer works great! We've been using it for about a month now and haven't had any problems yet.
Baby,5.0,... bought these as gifts and babies seem to really love holding a soft plush toy while using the pacifier,I've bought these as gifts and babies seem to really love holding a soft plush toy while using the pacifier. It keeps the pacifier in place and allows the baby to get it themselves when it falls out of their mouth.
Baby,1.0,"Overstimulating, ADD-encouraging, unsafe, and overpriced toy. Period.","I was very excited about this product, based on other amazon customers' recommendations. However, this jumperoo is unsafe and I am afraid to leave my baby in it. I have five main objections: 1) the spinning elefant is so close to the bar that it snaped my own finger painfully as I was showing it to my 6 mo old baby - I am really worried that my son's little hand will get hurt by it; 2) as all babies, my son is trying to put the toys he is playing with into his mouth, which causes him to move forward impulsively while inside the jumperoo. He banged his head on the sun toy, and on another occasion, hurt his upper lip on the green bar where the parrot toy is hanging; 3) the jumperoo is overstimulating - it &#34;attacks&#34; the baby's brain with stimulation coming from everywhere around him. All the toys rattle when you touch one of them, which breaks the baby's concentration as he is exploring one toy and makes him search nervously for what is making noise behind his back. I am worried that this toy is encouraging ADD!!! 4) my son is a very active kid, but because of getting busy with all these noisy toys, he hardly has the time to jump. I was hoping to get more physical excerce out of a toy callled a &#34;jumpreoo.&#34; Very, very disappointed and would not recomment this to anyone."
Baby,5.0,"love it, a life savior","This here is her best friend! She loves it, doesnt like other wubbanubs- the monkey takes the cake!"
Baby,5.0,this is great hooks on the stroller and fits nice in the ...,this is great hooks on the stroller and fits nice in the diaper bag.  One finger opener that is great while the other hand it taking care of the baby.  See though lets you know when getting low on wipes.  I really like this.
Baby,5.0,Fun sounds and music,My daughter loves this jumper. Fun sounds and music. Only draw back is that its big and bulky.
Baby,5.0,Best Value for Money!,The best and cheapest option for stroller storage.  Love this one!  Fits two drinks and a place for keys and other things in between.  Easy to strap on.
Baby,5.0,Great basic piece that's multi-functional,Fantastic entertainment that encourages development and builds strength.  The music and sounds are fun when on the limited setting.  My grandson looks like a little ping pong ball in it when he gets going!
Baby,5.0,No issues.,Works well and great price!

Baby,5.0,good deal,What a good idea a little stuffed animal on a binky.
Baby,5.0,This has been a favorite of my children also,"This has been a favorite of my children also.  The characters spin around and the leaves move up and down.  The music options are vast, and the music is good quality.  You can either have the light on the mounting piece on or off...it seems like my baby likes it on because it gives a cool effect to the things rotating.  Also, it's not too bright that it keeps him awake either.  This DOES have a remote control which is wonderful, and I haven't had any issues with ending to be in a perfect spot to get it to work."
Baby,5.0,wonderful mommy saver. I can finally put him down,Baby loves this thing
Baby,4.0,it's perfect for the job,"Fits right on my stroller! My only problem is the stitching is sewn crooked inside and its a bit lopsided but that's just my OCD speaking. Otherwise, it's perfect for the job!"

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It's my niece's favorite!! It has so many stimuli and is great qualify!
Baby,5.0,Jumperoo for Joy!,"I bought this product used and it was the best toy for my little one!  She loved to play and discover all of the toys on the jumperoo and she also loved to bounce!  When she started to cruise around furniture on her own she didn't like to be IN the jumperoo too much, but she still liked to walk around it and play with the toys.  It was a great relief for us as parents to be able to put her somewhere safe for a while as well. Great toy, holds up well, highly recommended."
Baby,1.0,"Worthless product, worthless company (withings)","Purchased this to use at home for my wife & I, who both have Android phones.  App continually crashed and would not show any video.  I submitted a support ticket, and after several days of no response, I posted a request for help on their facebook page, which was ignored for several days as well.  Once they replied to post, they asked for ticket # so they could help.  After promptly providing it, I was again, ignored.  This happened with several other posts to their FB page as well.  After 4 weeks, I just received a note back from support telling me it doesn't work with kitkat (which is on any new phone now..), and they have no idea when/if it ever will, and to just use the web interface for video streaming.<br /><br />This company is worthless, their products are worthless and they clearly care only about making money.  Considering they falsely advertise supporting android, I plan to submit complaints to the BBB & FTC due to their questionable business practices.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this product!"
Baby,2.0,"Photo is of TWO nice thick ""classic"" rubber ones- but they send 6 thin plastic ones","These are newly designed from thin plastic, not the thick rubber they used to be made of- they work OK but THIS SHOULD BE EXPLAINED somewhere in the description. &#34;Material Type Phthalate Free, Latex Free, Lead Free, BPA Free&#34; is what the description says. That's a list of things it is NOT, not what the material is. This seems needlessly misleading, like it was knowingly worded that way to avoid saying it was now made of plastic. Also, the photo is of TWO thick ones, while they send 6 thin ones. I didn't need 6 cheap ones. I needed two nice ones. Anyway. They seem to work fine, but the misleading AD seems pointless."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"A Xmas gift to my grandson, he loves it."
Baby,5.0,Infant Brain Development,This item was larger than it appeared in the pictures so it was added value in my mind. It can be hung on a mobile or just placed on baby's tummy or lap because it's easy to grab and investigate. The colors and textures are a big attraction and give visual stimulation as well as sensory stimulation.
Baby,5.0,I would recommend this!,My daughter loves this!! I would recommend this!
Baby,4.0,"Great for iPhone, not for computer.","I've had this monitor for almost a year now and it works great on the iPhone. The picture is very clear, even at night. I love that you can take snapshots of the kids in bed! The sound/motion alarm isn't fantastic and can go off for no reason or not go off when it should. However, I purchased a separate sound monitor and that systems works very well for us. One note though is their computer interface is complete crap. If you are interested in purchasing it based on this capability, I'd skip it. It doesn't connect 98% of the time, even when on the same wifi as the camera. You are supposed to be able to use the computer software to connect when not at home but it just doesn't work. The actual iPhone app works very well though. Overall very pleased."
Baby,4.0,"Ok, not great","We have the giraffe Wubbanub as well and our daughter does better with that one.  She's 2 months old and the giraffe seems to lay on her stomach better without falling out.  The monkey still works ok and we expect when she has more hand control she'll like this one better, but for now the giraffe is best."

Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Could have better range
Baby,2.0,Was a little disappointed that there was no weight to this,"Was a little disappointed that there was no weight to this, only fabric so it was no help at all to keep my son from spitting the paci out anyways."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Love this little item my grand daughter plays in it all the time
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The product was great. Unfortunately baby did not like the smoothie style pacifier.

Baby,5.0,One of the best purchases so far,Our little 4 month old girl absolutely loves this jumper. One of the best purchases so far!
Baby,1.0,wasted money,don't understand how these work.  they don't fit in the bottle cap.
Baby,4.0,Its very easy to jump in,My son loves this jumper. He goes crazy jumping up and down. Its very easy to jump in. The only issue is that its hard for him to turn. Even turning it myself with my hand there is a lot of friction. If I could make it where he could spin easier I would give it 5 stars. Keeps him entertained for a while and he loves to chew on the little lady bug thing.
Baby,5.0,Excellent product! Would recommend everyone to try. I was very satisfied :),Excellent product! Would recommend everyone to try. I was very satisfied :)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome Lion from Lamaze. The sounds it makes is hilarious for my baby.

Baby,5.0,My grandbaby loves it.,Great toy. My son bought one for my granddaughter and she loved it. I babysit her and decided to get one for our house. Sometimes she begs to be put on her jumperoo.
Baby,5.0,thought it would be a bit bigger that what it ...,thought it would be  a bit bigger that what it is but is very cute
Baby,5.0,Good product,Avent products are always a good choice
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,too cute
Baby,5.0,It's easy to find,"This is the only pacifier I will ever use. It's easy to find, the baby can hug it and does get spit out or pulled out as easily as others. Easy to wash and just hang to dry."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My granddaughter loves this! Fast shipping. Thanks!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,love this product
Baby,5.0,Great for City Mini!!,Great for City mini!!! Very happy with what I got for the money. Highly recommended over Baby Jogger's version.
Baby,5.0,Important Novel is a Fun Read,"One of the most important of Vonnegut's novels, and a quick, easy read. I just reread it after many years, and found it fun, refreshing and altogether enlightening. I highly recommend it!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent for storing milk or covering the bottle with it ...,Excellent for storing milk or covering the bottle with it & taking it on the go. They are super tight & leakage free! You can use them freely anywhere without worrying!
Baby,5.0,perfect!,I got this for my baby brother and he loves it...it is the only pacifier he'll suck on..and it just looks so adorable
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"works great, fits perfect."
Baby,5.0,A jumping baby is a happy baby!,"The best thing for a baby. Keeps her occupied for at least 30 minutes, sometimes longer."
Baby,5.0,This is my second Rainforest Jumpero & I still love it!!,"Six years ago my older son loves this rainforest jumperoo, these why I decide it to buy another one for my new little one, and He Loves it too, It fits perfect for my 6 months baby ... It has a lot of baby stuff to keep him quiet for a while, the little fly toy was the favorite toy for both of them because it really helps with the itchy in their gum ... very happy with this purchase and it really works great with both of my kids so I am sure this is the perfect choice for babies :)"
Baby,2.0,baby ignores them,rattle is not loud enough and baby does not care for them
Baby,5.0,It's super cute.,My baby loves it. It's super cute.
Baby,4.0,different from old product,"these are different than the old ones which fit in with a pop.<br />these ones don't fit tightly with a pop, but only when screwed into the bottle, will be tight.<br />works well when bottle is screwed in tight."
Baby,5.0,Helped with small motor skills,"Kid loves it. Wish it expanded at the neck and legs and retracted. Would make it more fun, that's what I thought it did by the looks of it.  But my son will talk, stare right at it and has a lot of fun. Helped with his small motor skills for sure (most importantly)"
Baby,5.0,Best toy purchase we've made yet!,"My little one uses this thing like mad, multiple times a day.  It has been a godsend!  Heaven help us if it ever breaks, she loves it so much.  Buy it now if you need free arms to get stuff done."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby really does love this monkey. A+++++++
Baby,5.0,Son loves it,My son loves this wubbanub. It's the one that will help him fall back asleep the most. It's cute and does it's job.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves these
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very colorful and grand baby love this toy it fun for her.
Baby,4.0,6 month old loves it.,"Our little guy loves this thing.  He only learned how to bounce in it though until after we got a doorway bouncer.  Now he goes to town.  I do wish that the seat spins easier.  He can't spin it himself, I have to spin it around to see the toys in the back.  And I have to spin pretty hard but aside from that, the baby loves it.  We got it when he was 4 months, he was a little scared at first.  He's 6 now and still loves it.  The song isn't a bad one to get stuck in your head.  It's tropical and fun."
Baby,5.0,Best binky for kids that know those hands belong to them!,"My little guy loves this thing!  He loves to stroke his monkey while he's trying to go to bed.  It's so funny and cute.  It's basically his lovey and binky in one.  I did not give it to him as a newborn.  The round pacifier got in the way of his nose but the second he moved into infant phase and new his hands belonged to him, this was the winner!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome Jumper!!!!!!!,"I bought this when my LO was 3 months and she still loves it at 5. The music isn't too loud and yet entertains her at the same time. The toys still keep my LO entertained long enough. Truly a great product, would recommend every parent to get one."
Baby,3.0,Not a very useful item,Should have listened to my wife and just used the wipes as it comes in its pouch. Hardly used this product. It seems to dry out wipes as well.
Baby,4.0,good for City Mini,We use this on our City Mini and it works great.
Baby,5.0,How handy!,"Stumbled across these handy little things after much time spent looking at all sorts of other breast-milk storage options. These are perfect for me, since I'm a stay at home mom and only pump occasionally, with just a little stash in the freezer. If you want a big stash or are exclusively (or even just often) pumping, I'd definitely recommend getting breast-milk storage bags or something else, because storing milk in bottles with these little lids does take up extra room in the freezer. Works great for me, though! And they pop right into the bottle lids (just take out the nipple), so you could store anything in your Avent bottles (snacks!)."
Baby,5.0,Cute care seat toy,My son loves it.
Baby,5.0,its colorful and the sounds and theme is awesome!,My daughter loves this jumperoo; its colorful and the sounds and theme is awesome!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby boy loves it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,very good product
Baby,4.0,Great toy except for a safety hazard,"My 5.5 month old grandson LOVES this! He jumps and laughs, stops to play with and talk to all of the toys, spins them, and can even turn the seat himself. He is 25&#34; tall and can reach the floor at its lowest setting. It occupies him for quite some time. I gave it 4 stars due to others' comments about fingers potentially getting caught between the tightly spring-loaded elephant and the bar next to it."
Baby,5.0,The best $80+ we have spent,"Took some getting used to, but our son loves bouncing in this! When we first started using it, he would only stay in for a few minutes and couldn't touch the floor unless he was on his toes, even on the lowest setting. We added a pillow underneath, but since then, he has grown and no longer needs it. The best $80+ we have spent!!"
Baby,2.0,Not so good on the go,The lid never stays closed when you are on the go - which is what it's for. If u keep it in one spot it stays closed.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good item
Baby,5.0,"Excellent Product, Excellent Service!","I had an issue with the color mode on this device, so I contacted the company. I received a prompt response with excellent feedback. The troubleshooting steps I received solved the issue. This product has given my wife and I a peace of mind since our 1yr old daughter was born. We highly recommend this baby monitor, and the company provides excellent service. A+"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,thanks
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 month old granddaughter loves it. I guess that's all that really matters.
Baby,5.0,Fits Uppa Baby Vista,"I have only had this product for a few weeks so it hasn't been through the test of time. However, I love this product because it keeps its shape with a wire frame and is pretty universal. I went to many of the big baby stores, as well as to chic boutiques looking for something that will work with the Uppa Baby stroller and after many months if reading reviews, decided to give this one a try. Most of the ones I saw in the stores were either unattractive or expensive. The one made especially for the Upp Baby is three times the cost and didn't look as nice. This inexpensive and plain caddy works great and can stay in place when the stroller is folded. I use it to hold a small water bottle, my cell phone and small items (pacifier, hankie for spit ups, small toys) . Beats having to bend over each time the cell phone rang or if I needed her binkie I like it very much and for the price, it would be silly to get anything else."
Baby,5.0,We have been extremely happy with this monitor,We have been extremely happy with this monitor. After. 18 months the port for the power broke. We contacted withings and they were very helpful in repairing/ replacing!
Baby,5.0,soothing,"This mobile is great. It is soothing and attractive.  I have purchased two. The first had problems rotating like others have said, but the second one works great."
Baby,4.0,Small leg holes are a no go for fat thighs!,"I put baby in it for the first time today and she loved it. She liked the toys and the noises, so different from her standard door way jumper. However, most of the toys face outwards and she can't reach the two hanging ( she is pretty tall at six months ). Also the leg holes in the seat are barely big enough, she has large thighs. She can't turn the seat around, but I'm sure it will loosen up with more use. The only other problem is the &#34;chew&#34; toy won't stand up at all. It lays down over the edge and she doesn't even know it's there. It's a good product and it could be great if they would only fix the problem with the toys."
Baby,5.0,Easy to assemble and loads of fun for baby,Delivery was quick. Easy to assemble and loads of fun for baby. Thank you
Baby,5.0,Jumping for Joy 6 month old boy!!!!,I love this jumper for my 6 month old and he loves it too. I tried to have him use it at about 4 months but he didn't really like it as much as he does now. Built very well and strong for a kid who looooooves to bounce!
Baby,5.0,He needed a pillow for support underneath and a few blankets at the time but he loved sitting in it and playing with the toys,My son has had this since about 4 months old. He needed a pillow for support underneath and a few blankets at the time but he loved sitting in it and playing with the toys. When he grew more and was able to start jumping he was always happy in it. He's now a year old and able to crawl and starting to learn how to walk so we hardly use it but when we do he's super excited and can't wait for us to put him in it. This product was a lifesaver. My son had colic and he would be happy in his jumper. It was the only thing that helped at the time.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for stroller,Perfect size and durable. I use it on my city mini and quinny buzz strollers. Very polished look.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"So cute, and my son loves it!"
Baby,3.0,not a very secure fit,These will only fit the classic bottles but they leak anyways.
Baby,5.0,Lamaze toys are awesome,"Our son LOVES the Lamaze toys!!!  Along with Sir Prance A Lot, he has Mittens the Kitten and Jacques the Peacock take-a-ways, as well as the Puppytunes toy. The bright colors attract his attract his attention; the soft cloth is chewable and washable."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my baby loves it
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,its bulky

Baby,5.0,Great product!,This is our second Wubbanub... My 2 month old granddaughter loves it!!!  Great product!

Baby,5.0,Great activity gym - buy when your baby is very young!,"This is a beautiful, fully-equipped, activity mat that will definitely grow with your child, but make sure you buy it early on, especially given it's on the pricier side. We had a few activity mats/&#34;gyms&#34; for our daughter's first year of life. Unfortunately, we didn't end up buying this one until she was four to five months, which was probably a little late to fully use it given she was walking by 10 months. We borrowed a similar version while on a trip around the three month mark (before she rolled over or was very mobile), and she absolutely loved the walls and being able to move herself around by pushing against them. Once she could sit confidently and, soon, crawl, she had absolutely no use for this toy (or any activity mats/gyms, for that matter)."
Baby,5.0,My grandson is 4 1/2 months. He's growing into ...,"My grandson is 4 1/2 months.  He's growing into it,  sits well,  starting to reach for toys.  He can't bounce or completely touch the ground yet but we seem to be only a couple weeks from being able to (they grow so fast)."
Baby,5.0,Love it so far!,Super cheap for the quality.  My 4-month old loves the different textures and sounds which helps the car rides go by faster.  She's entertained and not crying in the backseat.
Baby,5.0,Quiet time in the crib is so easy!,Our 2 month old loves this thing! Her favorite sound is the rainforest. She doesn't love the other music yet. She loves following the animals and coos to them. Great developmental toy.
Baby,3.0,fun bath time toy but the wood swelled around the ...,fun bath time toy but the wood swelled around the exit pipe and there was a breach of pressure.  This allowing the balloon to deflate prior to placing it in to the water.  I got my moneys worth.
Baby,1.0,Crap on Android devices!,Crap support for Android devices.  The app is free but it isn't updated and is horrible.  See the app reviews on Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.withings.withbaby&hl=en .  Without a good working Android app the camera is useless! Apparently it works great on iOS but it is supposed to work also on Android devices.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE HOPING TO USE AN ANDROID DEVICE!  Or check the recent Google Play comments to see if they have updated the app to make it useable.
Baby,5.0,Well worth the money!,"I'd been avoiding giving my son a pacifier to sleep because I didn't want him to have it as a sleep association, but after nearly 8 months of still waking several times a night and having him be soothed with a pacifier one night, my mom suggested I get him one of these Wubbanub pacis. I went out the next day and got him this monkey. While it hasn't made much of a difference in his night waking, he has started getting quite attached to the monkey. It helps him go down for naps so much better (especially for my husband). I think having the stuffed animal on the pacifier really helps because he has something else to hold. It has helped him fall back asleep on his own a few times at night too when he wakes up, which is great so I'm not always going in to nurse him. We're going to get another one of these!"
Baby,5.0,Love this toy!,My 3 month old baby girl loves this toy! We wanted to get her something that wasn't pink and this was the perfect choice. We have it on the car seat and she smiles at it every time we go anywhere.
Baby,5.0,Easy to assemble by myself--took less than 30min,"Got this for my 4 month old baby. Easy to assemble by myself--took less than 30min. The #1 height is just perfect for him right now. He really enjoy the music and laugh every time it makes animal noise. He's still small and I noticed he doesn't really play with the toys, except he grabs for the butterfly in the front and puts it in his mouth. But I'm sure that's going to change as he gets older and once he gets use to the jumperoo. Overall, nice product with bright colors. The music is nice with lots of different toys to keep bby occupy for awhile."
Baby,3.0,Cute but broken.,It is adorable but it arrived broken.  Two of the buttons for the notes did not work.  I have purchased many Lamaze toys and was always satisfied but not this time.  I would have returned it but it came from England and did not want the hassle.
Baby,5.0,It's great exercise to strengthen her legs,"My 4 month old granddaughter loves to bounce in this chair. Her feet couldn't touch the ground but I put a pillow on the floor,  now she bounces with glee. She looks at the toys but so far only interested with the butterfly, I'm sure she will get interested in the other toys once she is a little older. She has realized once she jumps the music starts playing. It's great exercise to strengthen her legs. I love the colors and how safe it is, I don't have to worry about her safety in this chair. She likes it so much my son ordered one for her house. Shipping was as promised."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Grandson likes this but he gets upset because at 3 mos. Old he canno<br />Reach the leaves.
Baby,5.0,good,Good product.
Baby,5.0,Great baby gadget,My 7 month old loves this jumper. He tinkers with all the little gadgets and jumps up and down laughing. It brings him such joy. I try not to put him in there longer than 20 minutes. It was also easy to setup. I would recommend this product!
Baby,2.0,I usually love LaMaze toys,"I usually love LaMaze toys, I received the dragon today, but it looks used, the plastic is dull and the mirror on the tail is all scratched. It didn't come in the traditional Lamaze packaging but in a plastic bag. I'm unsure I I will keep it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,LO loves it. We have 2
Baby,5.0,... researching jumpers before committing to this one and i'm glad i did,"I spent a lot of time researching jumpers before committing to this one and i'm glad i did! My kid loved this. Still does, even tho she's crawling and standing. So much to do and see on this toy.<br /><br />Incredibly easy to set up, has height adjustment options and also folds in to make it easier to travel with (which we have numerous time to the grandparents'!)"
Baby,5.0,It took a minute to figure out the best place to hang this on my mountain buggy duet,"It took a minute to figure out the best place to hang this on my mountain buggy duet, but I LOVE it. Perfect little cubby."
Baby,5.0,Amazing Jumperoo!!,"We got this in 2010 for our now 3 year old daughter and it worked great! We kept it and plan to use it for our new baby due this November. The jumperoo is very sturdy and I love that it matched the Rainforest theme we decided to go with in her room. My daughter absolutely LOVED it! I really liked that there were different level options for height so we could get more use out of it. Great product, it has survived several moves (even overseas) without any wear and tear."
Baby,5.0,WORTH the money for as long as your little one will use it!,"Couldn't live without this...yes the price made me weary, but I get this for all new parents.  I love these pacifiers without the plush animal attached, but it makes all the difference when this thing drops on the floor, my son wants to cuddle with it or easily find it...<br /><br />He eventually outgrew it, of course, but I don't ever regret getting this or the other 2 animal ones I eventually got as well!<br /><br />Worth the money, after toiling over the decision to buy!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The bouncing Grandbaby Boy loves it.  Wish I could share a video.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"perfect, fast and safe delievery"
Baby,3.0,"My daughter would not use it, seems kinda hard ...","My daughter would not use it, seems kinda hard for babies. Can you imagine holding your self up with your stomach muscles that are not developed yet."
Baby,4.0,hangs in face when needed most!,"I like this toy and my little one seems to like it as well. But when it's actually attached to the infant car seat handle, it pretty much hangs in little ones face - especially when in and upside down high chair at restaurants or shopping carts...."
Baby,5.0,My son loves it!,"[[VIDEOID:mo3M7N7CL6HVR02]]My baby is 5 month old, he loves it! We just bought this jumperoo yesterday."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,good
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is hands down my son's favorite toy! Keeps him entertained for a while.
Baby,5.0,Jump Jump Jump Around,My son loves this.  He can jump and play with it for hours.  It is easily assembled.  It is even more easily folded up to put away or to transport to Grandma's house when we visit.
Baby,4.0,Pretty great,This was exactly what I needed for my daughter. Ultimately resulted in less time looking for a missing pacifier!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very nice mobile .... Baby loves it 💙
Baby,2.0,Probably not worth it.....must be something better out there!,"I have had this baby monitor for one year.  When the camera worked, it worked great.  wireless to your iphone, has music.  However, it worked about 40% of the time and needs to be restarted constantly.  Now, after exactly one year of ownership, it has died and will no longer turn on.  Tried to call Withings customer service, but there's no phone number.  Getting the Sharx instead, which will hopefully function better!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,I was very happy with the product and very pleased with how quickly it was shipped.
Baby,1.0,HORRIBLE Product and Company - DO NOT BUY!,"Horrible app... seriously just awful. It CONSTANTLY sends notifications declaring alleged temperature changes and movement when nothing has changed at all and the baby hasn't moved a millimeter. The app is borderline useless and more of a nuisance than is humanly conceivable. It's almost as if they've set out to make the worst, most frustratingly annoying app possible as some kind of prank on new parents. That would make more sense than trying to accept that this was a valid attempt at a viable product. The monitor itself is decent, camera is good, night vision ok, and when we could actually get the app to work, seemed like there could actually be hope for this to work if they would update the app, but they have not and we've had this since December 2013.    The bottom line is that the app hasn't been updated in a very long time and this company has either left the product and app (and the suckers who purchased it) out to dry or just continues to ignore the thousands of disgruntled customers. I tried contacting the company to gripe, but to no avail. I, for one, will NEVER purchase a Withings product ever again. This has been a major let down and I am now looking for a new monitor amidst baby poop and spit up. I hope a company like this goes out of business, they certainly do not deserve to stay afloat with sub-par products, terrible/non-existent customer service, and b.s. advertising. DO NOT buy their products."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great for the price. We use it with our City Select Jogger and it works great.
Baby,3.0,Nice looking mobile but not for my son,"great looking mobile, but like others said it isn't loud enough for my son.  He looks at it and is amused for a few minutes.  We ended up buying the Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet for my son as he enjoys lights and the projection keeps his attention for longer.  The music level is about the same though, but the addition of lights makes it more enjoyable for him."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby loves his monkey Wubbanub
Baby,5.0,best jumper,"My son is 10 months now and still enjoys this jumper.  We bought it when he was 4 months and he's still going strong!  The toys still amuse him, mostly the dragonfly that just hangs off the side.  He loves batting at the plush top toys too.  The only con about this jumper is the hard removal of the toys to clean when baby spits up, and the seat cover was hard to snap on."
Baby,5.0,Well Designed and Easy to Assemble,Easily assembled and really like the ability to detach play items for quick wash. My boy likes it and I hope keeps on that trend.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"great toy, my baby loves it! especially the strong colors"
Baby,4.0,"Great for checking and lullabies. Would definitely buy again, but not the right choice if you want uninterrupted monitoring.","Works really well for us.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- Checking on baby while outside house<br />- Checking on baby without needing to open door<br />- Lullaby feature really does work for us! (try fur elise)<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Connection does drop out for a few seconds (or more) from time to time, so not a great choice for continuous monitoring<br />- Does not always understand that when you plug earphones in, the noise should only go to ear phones.<br /><br />Overall: Would definitely buy again."
Baby,5.0,Good buy for baby before they can crawl,"My son has used this jumperoo for months now. He loves the colors and toys on the front. It occupied his times for at least an hour and allowed mommy time to get other things done! My only complaint is that the seat wounldn't turn easily on my jumperoo, but my sisters worked fine. A good purchase even though its a little more expensice. Your child will get lots of use out of this one before they can crawl."
Baby,5.0,It is perfect for using in the car seat because it stays ...,My daughter absolutely loves her monkey!  It is perfect for using in the car seat because it stays in!  It's definitely worth the price!
Baby,5.0,my son is in love with this,"my son is in love with this!  he's a very active baby, and this lets him bounce and stand to his heart's content.  it keeps him occupied while i make dinner, clean, etc.  he loves the different noises and toys on it; we also have the rainforest exersaucer, and he likes this quite a bit more.  he's only 5 months right now, and i think the toys on the jumperoo are more developmentally appropriate for him."
Baby,5.0,Great internet baby monitor!,Great internet baby monitor!
Baby,5.0,It's taken a lot of wear and tear and has held up pretty nicely.,"No issues with this! This works on my B-Agile stroller. I've had many drinks, baby food jars in this organizer and it holds up. I don't remove it when I collapse my stroller and throw it in the back of my truck. It's taken a lot of wear and tear and has held up pretty nicely."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"It's fun, but it's really quite long. I haven't figured out yet what to attach it too."
Baby,5.0,Love it,My son loves this!! I've ran it through the washing machine and dishwasher & Mr. Giraffe has held up great. :)
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,"My baby loves this!  Bought it for her at 4 months (she's very  big and tall for her age) and she loved it. I put her in and her eyes went wide at all the different toys.  It took her several weeks to learn how to jump in it, because she was so young.  By 5 months she was jumping in it like crazy.  She is 6 months now and still not bored of it.  She plays with a different toy each time I put her in.<br /><br />It was easy to assemble and easy to change sizes on the jumper, too.  I did it by myself."
Baby,1.0,NOT a good fit for the Baby Jogger City Select,"Looked silly and was quite ineffective on our Baby Jogger City Select stroller.  No way could we have put a drink in this one, and it didn't look like it even fit with our stroller.  One of the few times we have felt like the Britax branded solution (here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007CTPWXW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_38 ) really does make the best sense for our stroller."
Baby,4.0,Great product. Would not buy for BJ City Select. Great to use with the cot,"The product itself is great for the price and build quality.<br />I bought it for my Baby Jogger City Select (2013) . I would not be able to say that it is a fit.<br /><br />1. The BJ arm is at an angle (with respect to the ground), all the way through. When you attach the organiser it will never hang up straight unless you fill it up with too much of weight.<br />2. When the seat is upright facing forward the back of the seat will keep banging with the organizer.<br /><br />I found another use for this organiser. I attached it to my baby's cot and is quite useful for a quick access during the night for different items like water bottle, mobile, nappies, wipes etc."
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Not a lot of jump compared to a johnny jumper.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"Love it!! My little one year old can't put it down. Of course we call the Wubbanub, Mr. Binks! The monkey design is great and the product is well worth the price."
Baby,5.0,The babies seem to love them.,I get these as baby gifts and they are always a hit. The babies seem to love them.
Baby,5.0,My son LOVES this toy! It has been connected ...,"My son LOVES this toy! It has been connected to his car seat since day one. I always here him back there banging it around, and now that he is a little older (6 months), he loves to chew on it also.<br />He gets growly when I take the giraffe off!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loved this!
Baby,4.0,My son loves this bouncer!/jumper!,"Awesome product. My son really enjoys jumping and playing in this bouncer. Keeps him entertained. Perfect for taller infants like my son. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of 2 things: 1) the leg holes are a little to tight. Every time I go to take my son out of the bouncer, the whole seat comes up and sometimes the whole bouncer gets pulled up too. 2) the leaves on the top with the stuffed bird and frog come out too easily. My son easily yanks them out every time I put him in the jumper. Other than that, it's great."
Baby,5.0,awesome,my granddaughter loves this!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves to bounce and play!
Baby,5.0,A great solution!,"Our second Wubbanub purchase (have to have a spare around right?)  This is a great binkie, when it falls it stays nearby AND has enough for the baby to hold onto and direct back into their mouth without your help every time!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Easy to put together, very sturdy and stable.  Grandchild loves the variety of things to look and play with."
Baby,5.0,I have a set of newborn twins... ...,I have a set of newborn twins... We received these as a gift and out of the many pacifiers that we have received we only use these two.
Baby,4.0,Versatile - will work with most strollers.,"Easily attaches to my stroller - an older stroller that doesn't have its own cup holder option. It velcros on, so you can use it with almost any stroller, I imagine. The velcro is a little clumsy (very long and requires wrapping around), but it gets the job done. It has 2 holes for cups, which is great for when I go on walks, and then a bigger middle section where I store my keys and phone."
Baby,4.0,Great Concept. Terrible Seat.,"I am pleased with the jumperoo. My daughter thoroughly enjoys it. I have one minor problem, which is why I did not give it a 5 star rating. The rotating seat doesn't turn well, so much so that if my daughter wants to play with one of the toys behind her, we have to turn the seat for her."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My nephew loves this!
Baby,5.0,Very good for baby with reflux,"My son has reflux, and he loves his wubanub. We call him coco the monkey, and when he has coco, he squeezes him and never looses his pacifier. It's great. :)"
Baby,5.0,This is great. My son loves the jumperoo and it a ...,"This is great. My son loves the jumperoo and it a nice, safe way to keep him entertained sitting up right for 10-15 minutes."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My baby boy and all the kids from daycare love it...it keeps my baby entertain.
Baby,5.0,Great jumper,"My LO loves this jumper! From the minute I put him in it he knew exactly what he was suppose to do! It jumps very easily and is very sturdy. He doesn't really care for the toys too much, just the butterfly with the crinkly wings. He loves to chew on it. He is 6 months now and I think as he grows he will become more interested in the other toys. The only thing I wish was different is the seat. One, it doesn't turn easily on its own, If he does happen to want to play with the other toys he can't turn himself to get to them like he can in his saucer seat. And two, it's a bit small like I said he is 6 months now, and in the 90th percentile for his age. So I'm afraid he won't fit in it for too much longer. Otherwise I love this jumper. And so does he!"
Baby,5.0,A must buy.,"I am a believer.  There is a reason that this product has high reviews.  First of all, this product was easy to assemble.  It took no more than 10 minutes to install.  After i got it setup and placed my daughter in the jumper, my daughter started jumping like she had this toy from the day she was born.  My daughter is only 6 years old.  Another pro with this jumper is that it has a lot of toy to keep my daughter amused.  The only con with this jumper is that it does take space.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
Baby,3.0,He likes to chew on it at least,"My 4 month old loves to put parts of this toy in his mouth, or look at the colors on the horses feet. I also really like that I can hang it from his activity mat and I think he gets fascinated by the colors. That said, this took over a month to arrive from when I ordered it, but I waited patiently. When it did arrive, stuffing was coming out of stitching lines that weren't straight and strings were hanging off everywhere. Ok, so I cut off the strings and pulled what stuffing I could see out of it. But this toy's washing instructions are surface only washing. So it was a pain to have to get every crevice I possible could clean with sanitizing wipes since I knew my baby would put it in his mouth the first chance he got. All in all, I guess it was worth $8, but I probably wouldn't order from the company again. Especially since it came with a bizarre card that read as follows:<br /><br />&#34;Tks a lot for your 5 stars comment: *****<br />Thanks for your purchase, please give us a 5 stars feedback if you like our product, also leave your well-meaning advice if you have.

Baby,4.0,Rainforest Jumper,Daughter loves this jumper
Baby,5.0,must have for babies!!,Oh my gosh!! My five month old grandson loves loves this! He just bounces all over. A wonderful purchase!
Baby,5.0,Life saver!,This has been a life saver!!! My daughter loves it. It took her until about 4 months to get used to it. She's a big baby I might wait until 5 or 6 months to put your baby in it. The lights and sounds are good and the fact that you can adjust the sound has saved my sainty.
Baby,5.0,Loved this mobile TWICE,"I love this mobile! I purchased it with my first child and when I had my second baby 17 months later, I had to purchase another one (one of the leaves would not open and close as before), but I don't think it was a malfunction on the product's behalf. Both of my babies love to stare at the animals moving around and the leaves opening and closing. Even my mother found it soothing! The night light on it is perfect,  its not over-stimulating. Great buy!"
Baby,4.0,Work great and as expected,The camera work great and as expected. It would have received 5 stars but the video is not as clear as i would like but it does not hinder the ability to see well. Only lost connectivity a couple times and it was only for a few seconds each time.
Baby,5.0,the best,love this item
Baby,5.0,5 star,My daughter loves this toy.  It is a joy to watch her jump on it.
Baby,5.0,Year of the Horse,I wanted a horse baby gift for My Korean friend's son who was born in the &#34;Lunar Year of the horse&#34;.  This was perfect.  Three month old loves it!  Quality toy- colorful and good tactile.
Baby,5.0,Great price and very colorful,My 5 month old loves playing with this. Great price and very colorful!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,One of my best purchases ever for my baby.
Baby,5.0,Great organizer,Bought for city mini double stroller. Had trouble getting it to stay in place so bought the Britax organizer for the other side which works great and holds this one in place. I use both on it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great!
Baby,3.0,"Be careful Android users! this is perfect for iOS users(iPhone,iPADs..etc)","I gave it a 3/5 because of the big drawback as it is highly unstable/unreliable when using it on Android devices(even the latest versions of Android), especially on Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (where I have tried it), on my HTC one mini it is working from time to time but I still wouldn't give it a 5 as it works sometimes and you lose the video feed and need to end the application process and re open it again! (constantly).<br /><br />On the other hand in iOS devices (iPhone, iPad..etc) it is working perfectly!<br /><br />It's a shame that such a nice product is not properly working on Android OS..."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fast shipping - product as described.  Thanks
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love this little thing!
Baby,5.0,Excellent Affordable Alternative,"I was hesitant to buy this for my City Min since it was the same brand, but I couldn't bring my self to spend the $$ for the baby jogger brand console. I am very happy with this item. The drink holders are elasticized so I'm pretty sure they will be big enough to hold any drink I may have. I really like the zippered compartment, I'm always afraid that it I'm walking near the water and I hit a bump that I might lose my cell or keys. The Velcro straps allow for the perfect fit, and it can stay on the stroller when folded. Can't ask for much more!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,baby boy loves this toy
Baby,1.0,"The monitor does not work consistently, and this is ...","The monitor does not work consistently, and this is something that you need to depend on.  We have done everything that support has suggested, and it still does not work.  I would not suggest spending the money on this monitor."
Baby,1.0,The Worst!,The red slide kept moving and drying out the wipes. So I put it in a ziplock bag. Then it got moldy. Then the red thing broke off all together. Total waste of money.
Baby,5.0,Love!,My 4 month old son LOVE this!  It was easy to put together and he has a blast on it. I am extremely happy with this purchase!
Baby,1.0,This ended up being very inconvenient. I had an ...,This ended up being very inconvenient. I had an older iPad and iPhone at the time and it would only work with updated software which couldn't be downloaded onto the older hardware. I wasn't about to change all my hardware just to use this.
Baby,3.0,Could do better.,"There are more pros than cons, but since there are a few cons, I would give it 3 stars.<br />I like that the cup holders are elastic and can fit different size bottles. I like that it attaches by velcro because it is easy to get on and off and move/clean if needed. and the quality seems good so far.<br />I do not like that it is one big pocket that has dividers because if you put something small (like a key) in one of the holders, it moves around across the whole carrier. and what i dislike the most is the mesh pocket. I wish it was a completely closed pocket. We do not have a pacifier holder and I would love to keep an extra pacifier with the stroller (if i am only running out for a few minutes and do not have my diaper bag), but there is nowhere to keep it. I have kept it in the mesh zipper pocket, but i feel like it gets dirty in there and i would not want to give the pacifier to a newborn if it has been sitting exposed to fumes etc."
Baby,4.0,Hold her better than other ones though,Baby is tall for her age and is still too short to touch the floor. I don't think they take into account the length of the child needs to be longer because legs bend a little in seat. Hold her better than other ones though. She is tall and skinny. She loves the blinky light parts but not that interested in the rest yet
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"best puchase ever , very useful , lot's of space"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love this!!!! One if his favorite toys!!
Baby,5.0,I would recommend it to everyone,"My 3 month old loves his wubbanubs, he snuggles it when he's sleeping and holds it when he's awake!this is the second one we bought, the giraffe is upper cute too. I would recommend it to everyone!"
Baby,1.0,One Star,Terrible quality. Read reviews and chanced it anyways. Not worth the money.
Baby,1.0,Doesn't work on an UppaBaby Vista.,"I have an UppaBaby Vista and this stroller organizer does NOT fit it. It barely reaches both sides of the handle, even though it is adjustable. I was disappointed because the price is great and Diono is a great brand, but it just didn't work for the Vista."
Baby,5.0,"He thinks it's the greatest thing, so obviously I also think it's the ...","My LO loves it. He thinks it's the greatest thing, so obviously I also think it's the greatest thing."
Baby,5.0,Good purchase,"Loved them definitely a goodbye buy for my little guy, seemed  to help keep the pacifier in his mouth"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it just wish I didn't Have to buy them separate from the bottles
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These are fantasist I...no more lost pacifiers !
Baby,4.0,Must have,We have this monitor and a traditional video monitor. We use both since our traditional monitor does not have a good range to it and once our baby was mobile we needed both monitors to see him at all times. It does disconnect every 10 minutes or so if you are using it on your cellular network. That is annoying. Love being able to see my little one when I am away from home.
Baby,3.0,I incorrectly assumed that the stuffed animal would be a bit heavier and so would assist in keeping the pacifier locked in a bit,"We ordered these for our 2 month old twins after night after desperate night of getting up every hour on the hour to insert a pacifier back into a baby's mouth. I can see in theory how they would work, if the baby has the motor skills to hold onto the stuffed animal. When I initially looked at the Wubbanub, I incorrectly assumed that the stuffed animal would be a bit heavier and so would assist in keeping the pacifier locked in a bit better. I'm sure the SIDS folks will probably put a hit out on me for saying so, but at 4 am after being up all night, the need for the pacifier to have some weight and holding power is pretty darn intense.<br /><br />Speaking of hits, the WubbaNub folks might not appreciate my saying that with a few more hours of sleep and energy, I could make one of these suckers with a pacifier, some thread, and a beanie baby, for far less money than the $12 we paid (x 2 since we have twins). So if you are even the slightest crafty, you might also be a bit ashamed of yourself when this thing shows up and you realize you could have slapped something together that is pretty comparable."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"good, but this time monkey has ears attached asymmetrically."
Baby,1.0,WASTE of MONEY,"We were very disappointed with this monitor!  It seemed to be the best at the beginning, because we could see our baby through an app on our phone when we were out to dinner!  But the USB port on the device, the little port that connects the cable to charge the monitor was so tiny that if you didn't plug it in correctly it would BREAK!  So customer service was great and gave us a replacement. (even though it was 1 month later!)  But the SAME thing happened to the second!!!  This made us furious!!  Call it human error, but this monitor is so delicate that if baby pulls on the cable the whole thing falls apart and it can't be charged anymore!!!  Also, the base on which the monitor stands in on the crib is so loose that with any movement our baby made, the monitor would fall into the crib!!!!! BIG BABY DANGER!!  Totally not recommendable!!"
Baby,5.0,Great idea!,A great concept!! Baby can hold onto the pacifier well with the cute monkey attached.
Baby,1.0,Terribly disappointed!  Bad execution!  Save your money or better yet make your own!,"Good idea, bad execution.  Sigh, you'd would have thought these socks would have at least been in sock material or at the very least have elastic at the top to hold onto baby's calf area.<br />They just fall right off.  Baby is trying to play with them and when he grabs the bugs or tries to mouth them, they just come right off.  Highly disappointed!  Going to try to return them.  What's the use when they don't stay on the feet?"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Grandson loved playing with it. Worth the money
Baby,2.0,am very disappointed with this,"am very disappointed with this. don't really do what it said it would, hard to place on crib.  would not recommend it. not worth the money"
Baby,5.0,The BEST thing we could have purchased for our newborn!,It keeps the pacifier in with a &#34;light&#34; amount of pressure.  Everyone sleeps better.  You can easily tuck it into the swaddle as well.  Highly recommend!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great item. My son loves to bounce in it
Baby,5.0,Initially it was great to help baby drift off to sleep,"Even at 10 months, our bub still loves to play and listen to the music. Initially it was great to help baby drift off to sleep."
Baby,5.0,It's very sturdy and can be adjusted as baby grows,My 3 month old baby loves his jumperoo!  There are so many things to keep his interest while working those busy fat legs.  It's very sturdy and can be adjusted as baby grows.  I feel confident that baby is safe and the jumperoo allow me to get things done without worrying about his safety or boredom setting in.  The jumperoo is also a great way for my baby to release all his built up energy!  I think this is the best one you can buy.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fit my Natural bottles perfect. Great for storing breast milk easily.
Baby,4.0,This is a fantastic monitor! Night-vision,"There is an occasional glitch, it is an electronic device, after all.<br /><br />BUT, This is a fantastic monitor!  Night-vision, access-sharing, the microphone, pan and zoom all work very well, 90% of the time.  The 10% of the time there is an issue, it has always been resolved by reconnecting to the monitor.<br /><br />There may be better options nowadays, so I'd continue to do my research, but I do not regret getting this monitor for our baby."
Baby,5.0,Great for Baby!,I love this toy since it is colorful and interesting for baby.  It has plastic parts that act as teething rings.  I like the clip to allow it to be attached to a car seat handle - it keeps it off the floor and close for baby's investigation / play.
Baby,5.0,Parents to be are so pleased with this gift,Parents to be are so pleased with this gift.  They can view the nursery from their workplace via I-Phones.
Baby,5.0,I love it,Best bouncer ever!<br />My daughter loves it!
Baby,5.0,so easy to put on and off because it velcros,"a big hit, i got this for my 4 month old for christmas, this has been a lifesaver on roadtrips or outings.  so easy to put on and off because it velcros, but good enough that baby dosent pull it down."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,good
Baby,5.0,My 9mo old loves loves loves his monkey binky!,My sons favorite baby item ever!
Baby,3.0,"Apparently ONLY fits Avent's ""classic"" bottle",Apparently I don't have the &#34;classic&#34; bottle.  Thought I did. Sure wish Avent would lable their products better!
Baby,1.0,"I love Skip Hop, but do not love this case!","The red cap pops off. Others mention this. I lost mine, which was loose to begin with. Get the OXO Tot On-the-Go Wipes Dispenser. It's smaller, but still fits any size wipe, holds a decent amount, and the wipes don't dry out."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,So cute!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Amazing monitor night mode works great.<br />Motion detector alerts you when anything moves in the babies room
Baby,5.0,Great to baby busy,"Baby loves this and it wears them out, to sleep that is."

Baby,5.0,Best stroller organizer at such a good price!,"They say you get what you pay for ... so I was skeptical getting this &#34;cheaper&#34; stroller organizer.  But it's perfect.  Seriously.  The velcro on the straps are strong so I'm not worried about it falling off even if I cram the organizer full of junk.  It has 2 bottle holder compartments, one on each side.  One is ever so slightly larger than the other on mine, so I use the slightly larger one for my water bottle and the smaller one for my 2 year old.  There is a hidden zipper pocket that I use to store my keys so I don't lose it.  I'll also put extra hair clips in there to so I always have one just in case.  The actual body of the organizer is huge.  We used this on a trip to Sesame Place and it held both my Samsung Galaxy S4 and my husband's iPhone 5, the map of the amusement park, 3 oz sunblock tube, a small sunblock face stick, the souvenir drink bottle, a stainless steel water bottle, and my eye drops.  I didn't have to dig around to find anything.  I didn't have to readjust the straps at all.<br /><br />I have used this on my uppababy vista and the summer infant umbrella stroller.  I'm a little wary about hanging anything on an umbrella stroller in fear of it tipping over when my kid is not sitting in it, but it has yet to tip over.  Just don't leave it on and fold up the umbrella stroller since it won't &#34;crush&#34; well.  It's fine for full sized strollers, but umbrella strollers become a little too compact for this."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"My nephew loves, loves, these animal pacifier."
Baby,2.0,Damaged,Part of toy was damaged. Mirror came with multiple scratches.
Baby,4.0,Handy product,"I have a Peg Perego stroller.  This attaches nicely, and holds what I need it to hold.  It is also bendable.  This is great because you can bend it flat if needed when folding your stroller.  I do wish the cup holders were bigger."
Baby,5.0,FANTASTIC item! Our son (and we) researched this type ...,FANTASTIC item! Our son (and we) researched this type of product and this was by far our favorite. Our granddaughter has one in her home and we (the grandparents) have one for when she visits!!
Baby,5.0,Favorite newborn pal,All three of my kiddos had this Giraffe. Since it had been a few years between kiddos I could not find this in stores. Prime shipped it super fast as always and my sweet lil Carter loves his new friend.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Our baby like it.
Baby,3.0,Foot fell off,The foot fell off after 2 days of light use. We have bought several of these in the past two years and this one was not made as well as the others we've tried. I won't be going with the monkey next time.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great granddaughter loves it.
Baby,5.0,Worked perfectly with the Britax B-Agile,"This was a great purchase for us! We used it with the Britax B-Agile stroller and it was much cheaper than the Britax version of this. It seems like it would work well with many other stroller brands, as well. It's held up well for the two years we've had it."
Baby,2.0,Not the greatest,I thought this case was a great idea but in reality it's a pain. The wipes dry out too fast and the opening is not so easy to use while changing a squiggly baby.
Baby,5.0,Works as promised,"Excellent travel case for wipes.  Holds plenty of wipes for cleaning up several days of BM, and dispenses the wipes one at  time."
Baby,2.0,Doesn't really stay in place and there is no good way to attach it to my stroller so that ...,Doesn't really stay in place and there is no good way to attach it to my stroller so that every compartment can be utilized.  It also doesn't do a very good job holding drinks in place.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves them!
Baby,5.0,Works Great!,Easy to install - versatile - stroller folds without removing this (City Mini)
Baby,5.0,"Great for the car, buying another for the house!","My 12 week old daughter loves this toy. I originally bought it for her car seat and am back to buy a second to have around the house. The velcro loop securely attaches to lots of things yet is easy to take on and off (even one handed!). It's much bigger than many similar toys I considered, which ended up being a bonus because she can reach the toy easily and even bring parts of it to her mouth. It makes car rides much happier for everyone, and keeps her occupied in her bouncer long enough for me to eat lunch, do dishes, or fold laundry."
Baby,4.0,Very pretty product. Your child will enjoy but seemed overpriced,"Very pretty product.  Your child will enjoy but seemed overpriced.  If you can't find on sale, don't pay full price."

Still doesn't work like they say you can pick it up anywhere if you are out on a date with your husband you can look at your child in the bed at home sound asleep.  It is a good monitor but ended up costing me more than expected.  I am a grandma so I wanted to make sure I had what I needed to make it work.  Not sure it is better than other home monitors.  I had a Summer Brand that cost $160,  only lasted a year..... so we will see what happens in the future with this one.  But I do like it."

Baby,4.0,Love this jumper!,Our 4 month old loves to stand when held and is very active. This jumperoo is too high for him even at its lowest setting so we just have to place a book under his feet but otherwise I'd give it give stars. He loves the toys and jumping!
Baby,1.0,"Shady product, sketchy company.","Do not buy this product. I recently purchased a new withings monitor but open opening the product discovered it was clearly a used item. Furthermore, upon trying to set it up I was unable to complete the installation as a security measure prevented me from access the monitor due to a previous users email account already being associated with this so called &#34;new monitor&#34;.  The message include instructions to contact customer support... Interestingly enough they do not have a customer support phone number. This company is shady. I will be returning the product shortly."
Baby,5.0,Great little gift,My 6 month old grandson loved these.  Very bright and fun.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good
Baby,3.0,Decent toy,"This is pretty big, about 10&#34; long and 8&#34; high. My son never really dug this but every kid is different. No hard parts for baby to chew on, all soft stuff, oh except the little rings on the tail. We washed this in the washing machine and it came out fine."
Baby,5.0,Baby loved this one- was sad to see him outgrow it,Baby loved this one- was sad to see him outgrow it! He was a jumping machine and he is one strong boy. He loved the red frog seat and once he was a little older and noticed the hanging bird and frog he loved them too. Simple with nice color and does not over-stimulate the child.
Baby,5.0,Indispensable,Peace of mind combined with amazing convenience. I have already bought Another one of these units as a gift for new parents.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Doesn't fit so well when you have a diaper bag underneath.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is Ralph and our baby loves him!
Baby,3.0,Quality seems fine.,"I have the thinner Dr Browns bottles, Ameda pump bottles, and gerber bottles. These bottles are all compatible with one another, and I would consider them to be standard bottles.  FYI, the Philips Avent Classic bottles sealing caps DO NOT fit any of my bottles.  They are much wider than a standard bottle opening.  I didn't realize that when I purchased them.  Quality seems fine."
Baby,5.0,my 2. 5 month old got this as a ...,my 2.5 month old got this as a present and she loves it! She is technically too little for it but we put a towel in the seat behind her so she can reach the toys and play.  She is already learning how to bounce and stands up in this all the time now.
Baby,4.0,"Setting it up was fairly easy, but the seat was a little tricky","I received this item as expected and my daughter loves it. Setting it up was fairly easy, but the seat was a little tricky. All in all, it is a good product.."
Baby,5.0,Very cute!,"This mobile is adorable, made very well. My 3 month old grandson is not so excited about it yet. We think maybe it's because the leaves go up & down. His Mom & Dad are not giving up on it though, as he gets a little older we are all sure he will like it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Super cute and lots of fun!
Baby,5.0,Couldn't be happier (baby and parents),"Holy cow!  The reviews are right.  We bought this for our little one when she was 4mo and had to put big books under so she could reach the ground.  The huge smile on her face made any concern I had for the price go right away.  Now, at 10 mo she still gets excited to use.  Granted, not as often.  However, she has happily jumped in there for up to 40min laughing and giggling.  Couldn't believe.  Well worth the investment!"

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,best baby toy ever!!!

Baby,4.0,This thing is great! Our little one loves it and crawls to ...,This thing is great! Our little one loves it and crawls to it so we can put her in it. The only problem is that the seat needs to be a little more comfortable and the leg openings a little larger. Other than that she loves bouncing in it and the little main attraction toy keeps her entertained. Plus she starts reaching for the birds on top which is kinda fun for me to watch.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,excellent
Baby,4.0,Great organizer,Fits great on my baby jogger city mini
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves it
Baby,5.0,My grand son loved it! Lots of compliments and people wondering where ...,These pacifiers are the cutest things!  My grand son loved it!  Lots of compliments and people wondering where we got it!
Baby,5.0,Keep my breast milk fresh,I Love all of the Avent products and those sealing discs are just great to use with either the classic or the natural baby bottle.
Baby,5.0,Great for MANY strollers,"Ordered this for my Baby Jogger City mini double GT - works great, holds two big water bottles with a nice amount of space between for keys, phone, etc. Material is good quality, velcro is sturdy, I have no complaints! I would purchase this again."
Baby,5.0,Good First Hanging Toy,My grandson was just 2 months old when I bought him this giraffe to hang on his car seat.  He immediately started to stare at it and got very excited when it moved.  I also used it to hang on his play mat.  Definitely would recommend.
Baby,3.0,Love the idea and our daughter loves the Soothie pacifiers ...,Love the idea and our daughter loves the Soothie pacifiers but we thought the pacifiers were replaceable.  It's stitched to the monkey which makes it difficult to sanitize as well.
Baby,4.0,"my baby isnt that into it, but it's a cool product.","This product seems amazing. My baby isn't wild about it, but it just seems to overstimulate her. I was hoping she would like it better.<br />it is made of high quality materials and has held up well. I would recommend it for a very active baby."
Baby,3.0,Baby shower gift.,"Seeing as I got this gift for a baby shower present, I can't really comment on the quality or usage. What I can say is that the product doesn't look as nice as I thought it would. Looks as if they sewed a pacifier to a McDonald's Happy Meal Beanie Baby. However the reviews online from all those mommy blogs out there made it seem like moms and babies couldn't live without it, so I hope my coworkers baby loves it!"
Baby,5.0,Best monitor out there,"Best monitor out there, people complain about connection loss, that's because they don't have it set up properly, had for 4 months now & figured out when u move it to another location outside &#34;your network&#34;, u have to reset it or it only will work via Bluetooth without resetting to that network. Very simple just follow instructions on &#34;reset&#34;, I've tried 2 other monitors & returned them. This thing is awesome & until apple makes 1 I'm sticking with it for my child. Good Stuff:-)"
Baby,5.0,Perfect toy! It hangs just about anywhere,My son loves loves loves this giraffe toy. The black and white patterns keep him occupied during long car rides. Before he fussed a lot now he has something to look at and play with while he's in his car seat. I got it for him when he was 1 1/2 months old. He is now four months and doesn't go anywhere with this toy. A must buy for busy mommas or daddies always on the go or just get it for some fun playtime for your baby. Definitely worth buying:)
Baby,5.0,Love this!,Loved this & it's super cute:) my babyboy loves to hold his monkey while soothing himself with the nunu. It's a great product.

Baby,5.0,Good product and helpful too.,On the wish list for new mom.  She likes it.
Baby,5.0,Best gift ever for someone with a new baby,Best gift ever for someone with a new baby. Very sturdy and washable and can be used as a child grows. Would highly recommend to others.
Baby,4.0,No regrets,"For how inexpensive this was I think it works very well on our stroller (Uppababy Cruz).  The only thing is that if you're attaching the seat to the stroller and it's reclined more than halfway it tends to get hung up on the organizer and you have to pull it out of the way.  I try to keep it towards the top but it slides down sometimes.  Other than that I love it; it holds 2 full drinks and has plenty of room in the middle.  It even stays upright when I collapse the stroller, which comes in handy when I leave my phone or a pacifier in it."
Baby,5.0,Great.,My 2 month old loves the different colors.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves it
Baby,4.0,Face looks sad,It's cute but my son thinks it's sad because of how the face looks
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,We bought this for our Granddaughter because we do the daycare for her and she loves it!!
Baby,5.0,6 sealing discs,Six sealing discs for both Natural and Classic bottles.<br />The actual product looks different from the pictures. Luckily I prefer what I got.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These were perfect and they fit the Avent natural bottles we use.
Baby,2.0,Don't like the open area in the middle,Didn't work on our City Select stroller at all. Don't like the open area in the middle.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great!
Baby,3.0,This is pretty good but it won't keep coffee in to-go cups ...,This is pretty good but it won't keep coffee in to-go cups from spilling. It works well for water bottles b/c they have a cap that seals the liquid a lot better. Have spilled coffee many times in this...looking for a different cup holder now
Baby,5.0,Attached just fine and definitely comes in handy when I need to ...,Attached just fine and definitely comes in handy when I need to store some small items and some drinks on the stroller. Easy to wash too.
Baby,5.0,She will happily jump for hours if I let her,"My (95th percentile height and weight) child LOVES this toy.  She will happily jump for hours if I let her.  I did really appreciate how easy it was to adjust to the different height settings.  It was a little hard to get it into the third and final setting, it takes a little bit of maneuvering to get it through but still very doable without tools or help.  Edited to add - this was hands down one of the best baby purchases I think we made.  Although my child continued to stay on the top of the height and weight charts she used this thing ALL THE TIME.  I recommend this to everyone."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 2 months old DD loves it!
Baby,5.0,Cheaper than Britax,It can definetly be used with any stroller. It was inexpensive and I love it!!! I used it as an alternate to buying the one Britax offers. Why would I spend 3x the amount?  This did the job and at the time for only $7!
Baby,5.0,All around A+,"Great products, excellent customer service, they really take care of their customers and represent their products well! We have the Withings Smart Baby Monitor and couldn't love it more!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,its very good product but some time it gets disconnection
Baby,5.0,good product.,"Same as described, good product..I love it"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excelent
Baby,5.0,Perfect,Realy good!
Baby,4.0,Life-saver! Keeps baby occupied and happy!,"I had no idea a baby  could love a toy so much. At a little over 3 months I put my son in here with a pillow on the floor so his feet could touch and right away, he would love jumping up and down, making the lights and sounds go off. Now, a week shy of 4 months his feet touch and he loves it even more. He plays with all the the toys on it and even loves looking up at the hanging toys. The only reason I gave it four stars is I have to be able to see if he can actually spin around in the seat. Right now, he can't, but I don't know if it's just because he's too little and not strong enough. I have my doubts because the seat does seem a little stiff to spin when I turn it around for him."
Baby,5.0,Gotta have one of these - great storage capacity!,"This is a great product for the money! I purchased it to go along with my Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis and it is an awesome investment. It is way more functional than any stroller tray I have had on any stroller I have owned in the past because it holds up to four sports water bottles and my keys and phone. It also is made of flexible material and doesn't cause issues when the stroller is folded up. Paired with my stroller, I just don't think I could have done any better with the purchase of these items and their value."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works great for our City Select stroller.
Baby,4.0,Amazing product. Keeps my son entertained for a good ...,"Amazing product. Keeps my son entertained for a good amount if time. The only negative is that I wish the part where the baby's chest rest was cushioned better. Otherwise, perfect!"
Baby,5.0,Very cute,This monkey pacifier is extremely cute & appears to be well made.
Baby,5.0,Great,"It's great. I love that it has a velcro strap so I can attach it to anything - baby gym, stroller, car seat. It's low enough that the baby can grab it, but not too low. My son loves it."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"Very good, cute and safe."
Baby,5.0,A great sensory toy for your newborn,My LO loves this giraffe. It was one of the first toys that caught his eye when he was just over a month old. We would hang the giraffe on our stroller bassinet handle and go on long walks. He loved staring at his giraffe.
Baby,5.0,Great,Perfect for the price!  Two friends have purchased after seeing mine :)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is my favorite container... It actually works!
Baby,5.0,My 8-month old grandaughter gets energized everytime she sits in ...,My 8-month old grandaughter gets energized everytime she sits in it.  She's always finding some new aspect of the thing to engage with.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my little guy,"My little man who is 3.5 months loves his giraffe. It has plenty of things on the bottom for him to grab and keep his interest with things such as a shiny mirror(the reflection isn't true fyi more like a fun house mirror) and a plastic rattle, one of the feet has an internal rattle as well and the tummy of him is crinkly. He hasn't gotten to much into the red teether foot yet but likes to chew on the sides of the mirror. I strap it to his car seat handle or his toy bar on his bouncer seat also from bright starts. I like this toy (and so does he) more than his similar lamaze toys, it hold his interest for quite a while. One thing I just noticed is the Velcro strap on the top of mine is green not black and white like the one pictured."
Baby,5.0,Was easy to take the pacifier away because she kept the ...,Very cute! We used one of these for my daughter and she loves it and is now two. Was easy to take the pacifier away because she kept the animal and has something to hold that she already loves dearly.  When she was a baby we could swaddle the animal up in the blanket so she could find the pacifier by her mouth if she spit it out at night. I am sure our new son will love his monkey too.
Baby,4.0,"super cute, used them for my son and now ...","super cute, used them for my son and now my daughter. also bought the velcro wrist ones. the socks unfortunately are not stretchy, nor are they shaped like a foot. they are a straight tube and don't go on a foot easily unless it's very very tiny, which my son's never were. wish they were shaped like a sock."
Baby,5.0,Sturdy. Love this thing,My britax folds with this on. It fits my wristlet and up to three drinks. Sturdy. Love this thing...
Baby,5.0,Love it!,My baby's favorite thing in the world!! I wish I had bought this earlier. My son loves playing with it!
Baby,5.0,Great pacifiers,My grandson loves these!  Easy for him to grab! :)
Baby,3.0,Get it for cheaper!,"I got this item from amazing savings for only 10.99! P.S.the fin on  the  leg falls off, and you can't get the little black shrug off because of glued fins on her arms."
Baby,5.0,Love seeing her so happy when she's jumping like crazy ...,OMG my baby is obsessed with this. She would stay in here for hours if I let her. Love seeing her so happy when she's jumping like crazy in it! She really started loving it around 5 months.
Baby,5.0,Best piece of baby gear,We love our monitor! Best decision we made regarding baby gear. Thinking about purchasing another monitor for older child because it is so helpful.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excellent!!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,very good !!!
Baby,5.0,This is an awesome product. Your baby will jump more than you ...,This is an awesome product. Your baby will jump more than you can imagine.I suggest you buy it as soon as your child gets head support to get maximum use of it. Once my son started to crawl he stopped using it.
Baby,5.0,Best jumper around,My daughter loves this jumper! It's colorful and engaging and the music is not offensive. I'm not sure how another reviewer's child got their hand pinched by the springs but I feel safe with my daughter in this.
Baby,4.0,Great!! Baby loves it,"Great!! Baby loves it. She hasn't figured out that it bounces and it doesn't turn easily, at least not easy enough for her to do it herself. Other than that she loves it."

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Best bouncy i ever bought. My daughter loves it and the height is adjustable.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love it for home, keeping tabs on the sitter and traveling"
Baby,2.0,I think I got a counterfeit  Lamaze toy,"The toy I received was shipped to me from China and it is missing a few product details, which makes me believe I got a counterfeit toy.<br />Here are my observations:<br />1. The 2 clicking rings on the upper left limb are smooth  and the colours are different from the toy shown in the product description.  My toy has a yellow ring and a red ring whereas the authentic toy has a  blue ring and green ring.<br />2. My toy did not come in an original Lamaze packaging.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag.<br />3. My lion is lacking the vertical stitching detail on the tips of its four paws.  The authentic toy has 2 vertical stitching on each of its 4 paws."
Baby,5.0,Really happy with the monitor and fantastic customer service,Really happy with the monitor and fantastic customer service. They sent a replacement power cord via next day air when mine somehow broke. Love companies that treat their customers well.
Baby,5.0,great product,great great jumper. my son loves this thing the entertainment is great music is great everything is great. i would recommend to anyone.
Baby,5.0,great toy,My baby loves this toy!
Baby,5.0,Works great for the price and seems sturdy,"Got this to use with the Baby Jogger Summit X3 double jogging stroller. I attach it to the side with my lighter child. It fits perfectly and meets my needs for having a couple of cup holders and a place to put my phone, etc. Works great for the price and seems sturdy!"
Baby,5.0,We now have a happy jumper in our family!,"Excellent product!  My daughter loves spending time in her jumperoo.  It is perfect for exercise and works as an activity center with music.  I haven't been able to leave her in other toys, seats or bouncers, but this one seems to do the trick.  I should probably wait until she is 6 months old to use it more often, currently we place a foam pad or pillow below her feet because it isn't adjustable to her size, but at 5 months old she can still use it with support to her back and feet.  We love her jumperoo as much as she loves it, her happiness is contagious."
Baby,5.0,Happy Baby in Pink,Have given this gift for multiple baby showers and it has always been well received.
Baby,3.0,nor are they are good shape for chewing on,"My daughter really enjoys this jumperoo. However, I am giving it only 3 stars because it is lacking a couple features in my opinion.<br />--My LO is teething and loves to gnaw on anything she can get into her mouth. This jumperoo doesn't really offer much for her to gnaw on. She loves to chew on the bee with crinkle paper wings, but this is the only option that she can bring to her mouth. All the other toys are fixed to the unit and can't be brought to her mouth, nor are they are good shape for chewing on.<br />--There are no hooks to add additional toys (for chewing, or otherwise).<br />--The seat does rotate, but is very stiff. The jumperoo at daycare has a seat that spins around easily for her to explore 360°. However, for this one at home, we have to rotate her around so she can try out the toys on all sides of her. Going to add WD-40 to it this weekend to see if it helps."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,I have this toy right on my 5 months old baby's car seat and he loves it. It keeps him occupied :)
Baby,5.0,Great toy - 6 Mo old loves it!,I love this! I bought it for my now 6 month old daughter and she loves to jump and play! She keeps finding new toys its awesome! She is so busy now and likes to be upright so this is a great compromise when she is tired of sitting up but doesn't want to lay down! Def keeps her occupied when I have my hands full not to mention the sounds and lights she loves!
Baby,5.0,WOW a WONDERFUL HELPER FOR THE TWINS !!,"What a joy this jumper is!!  My son has twin boys four months old. I take care of them three days a week.  They get bored easily and each have their moments and times of crying. I had gotten them the  Baby Einstien jumperoo.  No complaints about that one, BUT it is too large for them. They could not reach over the large lip on the seat to play with  the toys, and the seat is so big  ( they were premi) neither twin could sit up in the seat. plus it did not bounce.  I purchased the Rainforest Jumperoo, and WOW !!  they love it, feet touch the floor, they can sit in the seat, and reach the toys.  As soons as each had a turn , they would grab the toys, and start playing, and chewing on them; then they realized that they could eaily bounce and jump  No crying, just play!!  I LOVE THIS JUMPEROO !!  Peaceful, and happy babies."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,the neck doesn't stand up like in the pic unless you hold it from the top.
Baby,5.0,Love it,"I love this monitor!!! I can see baby no matter where I am, even traveling! It helps with the homesickness and gives you peace of mind while baby sleeps!!"
Baby,5.0,"lifesaver, very indispensable, highly recommended","great option, holds in place well on the infant's chest when it falls out of his mouth, baby can hold on to it as well, obviously a source of comfort to him"
Baby,3.0,Died too soon,Worked for 15mths- worked pretty well...<br />Then just died! Looking. For a new product.. Will not buy again
Baby,5.0,Perfect!!!,Exactly what I needed and such an amazing price!! Love the secret pocket for keys and money.
Baby,5.0,Great console to add to your stroller!,"We have the Britax Affinity stroller, which doesn't have any cup holders or other places to put our things in. When we saw the reviews for this as well as the price, we were willing to give it a shot. This is such a useful accessory to have! We can put in water bottles as well as place random things like our phones or sunglasses when we need to free up our hands for something."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The baby loves it
Baby,4.0,... of this jumper with my oldest 2 sons and LOVED it. Bought this one for our 3rd baby ...,"We had a previous version of this jumper with my oldest 2 sons and LOVED it. Bought this one for our 3rd baby after gifting the first to friends. The first version was somewhat better because the seat turned far more easily. This one seems to take a good bit more effort to turn and we can't figure out why; hoping it gets easier with use and wear. The best jumper we've found though, happy to have it back in the house for baby #3."
Baby,5.0,My great grand child loves this product,"My great grand child loves this product.  At first I thought it was too high for her feet to touch the ground and bounce by herself, but once putting her in the springs were just right"

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excellent
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"This is possibly the cutest toy ever!! Everywhere we go, people want to see it more closely! :)"
Baby,5.0,Must-have for any newborn,"These are one of my go-to baby shower presents. They are not only cute, but functionally, they keep the pacifier in the baby's mouth better than most other pacifiers because they are weighted with the stuffed animal. My sister recycled these for her 4 kids and highly recommends them. When they need to be cleaned, just throw them into the washing machine with some clothes."
Baby,5.0,AND IS EASILY PUT TOGETHER,"MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS JUMPER!! IT BOUNCES (ENERGIZED BY HIM) PLAYS MUSIC,  AND IS EASILY PUT TOGETHER."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter loves it
Baby,5.0,He will lay content for a good 15 minutes,"My nearly 4 month old loves this musical gym. He will lay content for a good 15 minutes, he loves batting the little tiger and hearing the music... over and over and over again!"
Baby,5.0,"Comfortable, stimulating playtime","I had my reserves buying this, even with its great reviews, however I am cautious with all on-line buys.  I can proudly say that I am loving this product.  I have two prime babies (twins) and just adore this thing.  They are small for their age of 6 months, but I just put a small pillow under their feet and they are good to go. I see this as a plus because that means I can use it for longer. The noises are easy to put up with, with for me is a big plus because you will hear it often.  My little ones love bouncing in it to make the sound go off.  It is stimulating enough to get their attention and to make them happy, but not so that it over-stimulates them. I like the swivel chair and it is soft on their legs.<br /><br />Another pro that stands out is that it is helpful for their hips.  I think they seem shorter then other ones, because the seat widens their hips with pull their legs apart. This is good because it is least likely to loose feelings in their legs or over strain their hips. Comfortable play time.  They like this so much that I am buying another one so that they each have one of their own."
Baby,1.0,We set it up and everything worked fine for about a month,"I cannot emphasize enough how disappointing this product is. My husband and I purchased this monitor in anticipation of our firstborn. We set it up and everything worked fine for about a month. Ever since, it's truly a toss-up regarding whether this thing is going to work or not. It is constantly losing connectivity and trying to reconnect, even when our router is literally in the same room as the monitor and crib! Not having connectivity when trying to figure out if your baby has rolled onto his stomach, see if he's asleep and getting the rest he needs or still awake, see if he's crying and standing or just whimpering and still laying down and might settle himself back to sleep, etc. is just not acceptable. I can't sleep train if I have to go into the room and disconnect and reconnect the monitor to get it working again! And if you've got an andriod, forget it. When and if this monitor works, I have to rely on using my husband's iPad since it completely stopped working on my android after a couple months. Please, if you're considering this product, save yourself the money (and it's a lot at that!) and frustration and go with another brand. This is the biggest waste of money I've ever spent in my life... for the most important thing in my life."
Baby,5.0,My infant daughter loves it!,My daughter loves her Dragon toy!  The crinkle wings keep her attention and she loves to suck/chew on the mirrored tail.  This is definitely among her favorite toys.  She's 7 months old and has had this dragon since around 3 months.  She's been very interested in it since the day it arrived.
Baby,5.0,Fantastic!,My daughter LOVES this jumper.<br />It makes her smile ear to ear!  By far the best thing I've gotten her thus far!  '3 months'
Baby,5.0,Works with Bumbleride indie twin,Bought two of these for my Bumbleride indie twin and they worked perfectly even when full of drinks and snacks. the Bumbleride twin has a bar in the middle of the handle so you can use one on each side.

Baby,3.0,Probably not the best organizer on the market,"Probably not the best organizer on the market. It works fine for light weight stuff (like a phone and a pacifier); however, if I put mine and LO's water bottles in, it often slips down or one of the side Velcro parts open apart."

Baby,2.0,I loved it for the first week.,"I'm giving it only two stars because unfortunately this didn't work for me. The green part on the left ear is coming apart and also strings are coming off the diamond shaped spots on the giraffe. overall this is a super cute toy, and my son loved it. I think that it should be able to last me more than just a week and a half. I was hoping to like this because it's half the price less than lamaze toys.GREAT AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE, I GOT A REFUND NO QUESTIONS ASKED AND SUPER EASY."

Baby,5.0,Keeps him happy while I make dinner and do dishes,"My 3 month old loves this! He can't reach the floor in it, but putting books under it works. Keeps him happy while I make dinner and do dishes. He giggles at the sounds every time!"
Baby,5.0,Favorite toy,These toys are a lot of fun for little ones.  They have so many textures and sounds to keep them busy and can go right in the washer when needed.
Baby,5.0,Simply the best,The best baby monitor. I am still discovering new features.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Just awesome.. my Daughter loves it...
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son is 4 1/2 months LOVES It! so colorful too
Baby,4.0,"Baby loves it, so do I!","We got this for our 5 month old because she loves to move! I'd never had one of these for my oldest so didnt know what to expect. It's a great toy and keeps the baby busy without over-stimulating her. There is a sound/light part, but we mostly keep that off because it's a little obnoxious and kind of loud; however, I do like that it's got an on/off switch! The other toys on the table are great and so far my daughter loves playing with them, even though she's really just figuring them out at this point. She is a little short still for her feet to touch the floor, but we've solved that easily by putting a throw pillow under her feet. I also like that the height adjustment is really simple, just flipping a little bar forward and moving the loop.<br />Assembly was rather easy, I want to say it took my husband (and &#34;helpful&#34; 3 year old) about 30 minutes from start to finish, and the hardest part for him was getting the seat cover on right (doesnt clearly say which way is front, although if he would have just listened to me, he would have known ... ). I also like that it's semi-compact, the round base can detach and close on itself a little bit to make it easier to store behind a chair or couch, etc. It's still heavy and awkward to move, but it's also a pretty big toy so that's to be expected. Overall, a great purchase, and one we will get a lot of use out of!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Thx
Baby,5.0,She loved it. It is not bulky and it also ...,I purchased this for my baby when she was 3 months old.  She loved it.  It is not bulky and it also collapses easily.  It is also easy to pop out the seat portion to wash the cloth portion of this. My lil one is 8 months old and almost outgrowing it..but she still can be in it for about 20 minutes at this point.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very colorful and my 3 month old grandson loves staring and grabbing the items.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Good quality and good fit to my bumbleride fryer stroller, love it"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Great idea for storing milk or homemade baby food!
Baby,5.0,My 4 month old loves it!,"My daughter is 4 months old and has just started to grab things. She began to get fussy when I put her in her carseat, so I wanted to get her something to play with. I ordered this giraffe and it has been so great! She starts playing with it as soon as I put her in her carseat and hits it/grabs it/holds it all the time."
Baby,5.0,it has nice side toys to play with,now I cannot imagine a world without this jumber. My baby loooooves this jumper.  it has nice side toys to play with. extra plus!!
Baby,5.0,"Durable, Fun, Jumper!","I run a in home daycare and have 3 children of my own.  We absolutely love the Rainforest Jumperoo from FP!  We have had this jumper for over 4 years.  Every baby I have had in my care, including my own, has loved it!  It is extremely durable.  Even after rough and everyday use, it has held up better than I would have imagined.  The jumping bungees are still in great shape!  My almost 3 year old boy still hops in of his own accord occasionally for a crazy jump!  It is a great entertainment piece for when you need to cook or vacuume, and keep baby safe and happy."
Baby,4.0,Such a great buy!,"Purchased this to go on my Bob revolution.  It fits great and can hold a lot- I keep a water bottle, my wallet, phone, keys, and a snack for my son with no problem.  I can fold my stroller with this attached with no problem.  My only issue is that it hits the back of the stroller because it does not sit upright- however, this is more a problem of the stroller than this unit.  Comparing prices to some of the other options out there, this was a no brainer.  Would definitely recommend."
Baby,5.0,Great price and works just as good if not better then the expensive brands.,Great little organizer. Had to talk my wife into this one. She wanted the more expensive brand as thats what she felt comfortable with. We ended up getting this one which was 20$ cheaper.<br /><br />Has been working great and actually saw the more expensive brand at toys r us the other weekend and there is NO difference.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Great Wipe Case,I love this case. It's a perfect size to hold the right amount of wipes for outings and is durable to last a long time. Others I have tried just haven't lasted.
Baby,5.0,One of the best baby items we own,"This was my son's favorite place to be for months. It was seriously some of the best money I've ever spent. I have twins, and both of them loved it, but my son in particular. In fact, even way past when either of them should have been in it, they'd still climb in and do some jumping for fun. Other than its size, this thing is awesome (and it's still smaller than a lot of jumpers). Batteries last a long time, it cleans well, and it never seems to get old. I can't recommend this highly enough."
Baby,1.0,BOOOOO,"BOO, BOO, and BOO. They leak! no good!"
Baby,1.0,These things SUCK!,They DO NOT SEAL!!!! I lost 20 oz of breast milk this week because of these discs. If you are going to store in the refrigerator standing up they're probably fine. I took one with me in my bottle bag. It fell over and ALL of the milk leaked out. I HATE THESE THINGS!!!!!!! It's hard work pumping milk for your baby to waste it like that!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,perfect
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Love this. Works great on my Chico Echo stroller. I use it daily with two waterbottles, my phone, wallet and keys and everything fits great with room to spare."
Baby,4.0,Lamze Toys are Cool...,Grandson loves these toys now 5 moths old seems to prefer the Moose as it has big horns that double as a teeter. Colors are bright and fabric crinkles and easy for baby to play with.
Baby,5.0,He gets so excited that he starts kicking like he's jumping even before we can get his legs ...,"For anyone who has a child that is old enough to put his/her head up, this Jumperoo is a MUST HAVE!!! It's unbelievable how much my six month old son loves playing in this thing. He gets so excited that he starts kicking like he's jumping even before we can get his legs in the seat.The music is a tad annoying after a while, but it doesn't stop the baby from having fun and playing with all of the gadgets that surround the top. Parents have a good 10 - 15 minutes of the baby not wanting to be held! Be warned, this thing is huge, so it's not something for tight spaces. We have a small house and I've just accepted this thing as another piece of furniture until my baby is old enough to not want to be in it. Yes, it's that good!"
Baby,1.0,DO NOT PURCHASE !!,"This monitor is unreliable.  20% of the time I wake up to the app saying that the connection has been disabled.  My device is 30 feet away from the monitor and my WIFI is exceptional as I need to work from home frequently.  I never know when the connection will be lost and since I am sleeping, who knows how long it could have been disconnected.  My infant is in jeopardy by using this device and I have purchased a different &#34;traditional&#34; monitor and it has worked perfectly.  The support from Withings is only through email and very basic.  Days went by between communications and who can afford to have that time pass without a reliable monitor.  This was a gift, so I would have never bought this especially after reading the disturbing amount of reviews on it's reliability.<br /><br />I hope this review and the many others just like it prevent other parents from purchasing this monitor."
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Pop in the ring, Does the job. No problems with leak."
Baby,5.0,I sent this as a gift.,I sent this as a gift.  It was appreciated seemingly.....unless they didn't want to hurt my feelings.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,We loved our &#34;molly monkey&#34; until the dog stole it and ate the nipple off the pacifier.  super cute.
Baby,4.0,Excellent for smaller babies,"These rattles look adorable on my son!  The bright, contrasting colors are just beginning to catch his attention at week 7.  However, they are almost too small for him at 7 weeks!  He's a chunker in the 85th percentile, but I was surprised at how small the wrist bands were."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Everything is perfect in Amazon!!!!
Baby,4.0,Ugly but fun!,"Why do these things have to be so ugly? The baby loves it though. She's 5 months and still too short to reach the ground even at the lowest setting. She's in the 80th percentile for height. Maybe it's because she's not heavy enough to stretch the springs. Not a problem though, I just put a stack of Flor squares under her. Easy to assemble."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Just what I was looking for. Pricy Though. ...
Baby,5.0,Good stuff......Recommend for you,Good stuff......Recommend for you
Baby,4.0,So much fun,"This is a grea product, so much fun and so many things for the little one to do and be occupied with. Almost wished I could fit in it myself!"
Baby,2.0,Washed Out,Very disappointed in this product due to lack of activities for infant. Wanted to have something different for my granddaughter to play in when we baby sit her than what she already had at her home but that didn't happen with this product. I returned it and purchased the &#34;Little Einstein&#34; one instead which offers more activities for her and places to hang other toys as well.
Baby,4.0,She really loves it and it was a great investment. My only dislike is that the springs ...,We bought this for our 5-month-old and she is still using it at a year. She really loves it and it was a great investment. My only dislike is that the springs hit hard when she jumps hard and it's noisy.
Baby,5.0,The best entertainment!,Best investment. Baby loved it from 2 1/2 months old. Now 4 1/2 months and even better!
Baby,5.0,AWESOME JUMPER,"My little one has so much fun with this!!! Such a great jumper!! The seat turns 360, he hasn't discovered that yet! But he loves chewing on the dragonfly between jumps!!"
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,I never recied the product and Wd like a full tefund
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very nice product !
Baby,5.0,This Jumperoo ROCKS!!,Probably the best thing we have bought for our son.  He LOVES this jumper!!  We started him in it at about 4 months and he is still loving it at 6 months.  It adjusts as he gets bigger in height and I can see him continuing to love it for months to come.  Worth every penny!
Baby,2.0,"... a year now I can say it has some nice features, but more bugs than you would expect","After using this for over a year now I can say it has some nice features, but more bugs than you would expect. Also Witgings has pretty much abandoned this product with not a single software update for the apps on Android or iPhone and not firmware updates for the device itself I think it's clear that they don't care. The main problem I have is the very bad apps, most people s complaints on here have been about it disconnecting, from what I've observed is you have to use a wired connection which is what I use but even then with a 1gb Ethernet the video is nearly 5 seconds delayed.<br /><br />Overall I think I'll eventually replace it with Dropcam, I have one if those as well and its so much better in nearly every single way."
Baby,5.0,Our infant loves this mobile. We will attach other ...,Our infant loves this mobile.  We will attach other items to it so he can pull on them and play with them in his crib (although we take them down when he is sleeping).  The other plus is that the animals face down towards the baby so that he isn't just looking at the underside of the animals.
Baby,5.0,Two year old still loves them.,"These are awesome until your vhd can chew them, or the dog -_- none- the less I've purchased at least 15 of these from them being destroyed or lost. They're a great product highly reccomend them. Wish I could get my two year old to stop taking a paci though (yea they're that good)"
Baby,5.0,PERFECT,"+++++  Exactly what we wanted and at a very good price and &#34;fast&#34; - Our Grandson loves it -  THANK YOU, gene"
Baby,3.0,The concept is a good one but I did not like the fact that ...,The concept is a good one but I did not like the fact that you cannot remove the p  pacifier to boil it and replace it with a different one
Baby,5.0,From the very first time putting our little guy in it he loved it. The joy on his face was priceless,"This was such a lifesaver for us.  Our little one wasn't quite ready to sit up yet but didn't want to lay down either. So purchased this. It was relatively east to put together.  One of the selling factors for me besides being a Fisher Price item, was the fact that it would somewhat fold up when we weren't using it.  From the very first time putting our little guy in it he loved it.  The joy on his face was priceless, He could sit up in it fine, and look around. At first his little feet couldn't even touch the floor we stuck a pillow under him and that was all it took. He was off.  Pure joy listening to him giggle and laugh.  And the array of toys is fantastic.  He never tires of being in it unless he bounces himself to sleep that is."
Baby,5.0,My twins love this!,We use this jumperoo daily! My twins came a bit early and are just now tall enough at 7 months old to be able to bounce in it on its lowest setting with their feet on the floor. Up until now we've had to put a cushion under their feet so they can bounce but they love it regardless. They really love the light up toys on the front and go crazy jumping in it. Definitely a must-buy.
Baby,5.0,great jumper,never used any other jumper but i have no need to
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Our baby's favorite by far!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The baby hasn't been born butvthe parents were happy
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby not bornbyet bjupppp
Baby,5.0,Loved,I was suprise how big the toy is and how bright the colors. Loved it
Baby,5.0,Huge hit!,"My four month old daughter is a little too young to fully enjoy this but she does enjoy sitting in it for a few minutes here and there. The jumperoo really paid for itself as soon as my seven month old niece got into it though. She was able to jump like a madwoman for hours on end (or so it seemed). The music isn't too obnoxious and it has two volume settings which is an awesome feature that all children's toys should have. It does have a hefty footprint, as all activity centers seem to have, but I envision getting tons of use out of this one and that more than makes up for the lost real estate."
Baby,5.0,He jumps in joy listening to the music and talks to the birds ...,My son loves it. He is only 5 and half months old. He jumps in joy listening to the music and talks to the birds attached to the jumperoo. :)
Baby,5.0,"Sturdy, spacious and cleans well.","This is a great stroller attachment. I've used it with a few different strollers. It attaches easily, is sturdy, and cleans well. It has enough space for 2 drinks and my phone, wallet, keys... And it cleans up really well. I've actually submerged it in water numerous times and and let it air dry in the sun."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,best baby toy to keep her entertained for hours.  no problem with springs breaking as stated in other reviews.
Baby,5.0,great,great
Baby,3.0,Missing Part,The item showed up as promised and works well enough as long as it is next to the router. It was missing the antenna!

Baby,5.0,Best darn monitor ever!,"This is the best monitor I have ever used. The best part is that I goes beyond using it for baby, it is good to look in on older children also so it will get years of good use. Also the company stands by their products. I have had mine a year and a half and I had an issue and they replaced it free of charge!"
Baby,5.0,Does the trick!,"Best $8 I ever spent. Can't believe my expensive Baby Jogger double stroller didn't come with a cup holder in the first place. I am so glad I didn't shell out for the Baby Jogger brand one when this one works just fine. Fits two water bottles, a bib, keys, and cell phone."
Baby,5.0,I recommend this product,"I recommend this product, though it's not a be-all end-all solution for OUR 5-month-old. He doesn't care to be in any one position or with any one toy for any long stretch of time. He has to be occupied all the time, with a WIDE assortment of distractions, everything and the kitchen sink, and then some. In this regard, Jumperoo, with all its sounds and colors and bouncing and gadgetry, has been only mildly helpful. Once our boy gets going, he gets over-excited within 10 minutes, and crying ensues."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my baby like it
Baby,5.0,awesome! Very well made and my grandson LOVES it,awesome! Very well made and my grandson LOVES it! He is 11 months and has been using it since he was 6 months. I highly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Very good investment!,Grand daughter (4 months old) loves this.  She is just beginning to reach out to play with the toys.  A sofa pillow under her feet helps her to jump.  Very good investment!

I ordered exact the same one but the color was off! It was more yellowish than light brown color. Because the color wasn't the same and it was not as cute, I returned it and decided my baby shouldn't take anymore pacifier and it worked just in 2 days :)"

Baby,5.0,Greatest Invention!,I love it and she loves it! This is the greatest invention ever...we had such problems with her paci falling on the floor now it stays put when she spits it out. The only change I might make would be to incorporate a clip in the mouth so you can change out the pacifier instead of having it sewn in.

We got ours almost 7 years ago (11/2007) for our first child. It has been through 4 kids and is still working great! We just put our 4 month old daughter in it and it's hilarious. She LOVES it! It's perfect when they are wanting to be mobile but can't really get around yet. Would definitely buy again!

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,alittle smaller than in looks online...but the baby is small too
Baby,4.0,Buyers be aware - you might receive the older version of these discs,"I placed two orders of these discs at two different vendors and was surprised to see that I got two very different looking products, even though they had the same product number on the back. Looks like the older version of these discs is more of a rubbery-type disc while the newer ones are plastic-looking. While both seal the Avent Natural glass bottles the newer ones fit more snugly (when pushing them they click into the ring) and look the same as the ring. Also, the newer version of the discs clearly states BPA free while this remark is nowhere to be found on the older version. I contacted Philips and they confirmed that the older version that I got was made after 2010 and thus is also BPA free. So be aware that you might not get the latest version of the discs."
Baby,5.0,Wish I could fit in this myself! :-),"Used this for several months, and my daughter won't give it up! The height is adjustable, allowing my daughter who is short grow with it nicely. Now my daughter stands on the outside playing with it...<br /><br />Would absolutely recommend to everyone!<br /><br />P.S. - Material washed very nicely."
Baby,5.0,Very glad we got this,"My son loves this toy! and because of the velcro top hanging part we can attach it to about everything! Very glad we got this! It keeps him happy in his car seat, and he doesn't like his carseat, which makes me happy! Its a very cute toy, I recommend it!"
Baby,2.0,Putting cell phones and snacks are fine!,This holder is directly right below the handle of stroller so it's kind of hard to put my drinks in if they are tall. Putting cell phones and snacks are fine!
Baby,5.0,love it,It's the cutest thing and my son loved it very happy I'm glad I purchased it and got it on time
Baby,5.0,Other than that it is great quality! Got it for my 3 month old ...,Giving it 4 Stars because for the price you pay I think the toys on it should be more entertaining. Doesn't play many songs. Other than that it is great quality! Got it for my 3 month old because she loves standing and kicking her legs but she's not quite ready for this toy yet.     Update at 5 months old:     I was wrong about the toys not being entertaining. Now that my daughter is older she loves them! She especially loves the little toy with wings. She gets so frustrated trying to rip it off of the bouncer to put in her mouth. She bounces likes crazy now & has a great time!!!! She is 28 inches long & this is perfect for her. (:
Baby,5.0,... spent so much time in this jumperoo because she loved it so much,"my child spent so much time in this jumperoo because she loved it so much.  it was such a lifesaver to know she was safe and happily playing so i could eat, do laundry, wash dishes, etc. i couldn't have made it through some of her days without this. can't wait to let baby #2 try this out! :) ORDER IT!  you won't regret it!"

Baby,5.0,The good: Easy to install,"We use it on the Toys R Us brand umbrella stroller.  The good:  Easy to install, stays in place, roomy, easy to clean.  Can hold two 16 oz coffee travel mugs+ bunch of other stuff.  The bad:  Doesn't fold well when folding the stroller. - The holder has to be re-shaped when opening the stroller again.  This is a minor issue, and overall, we are very happy wit this holder.  Probably the best holder on the market."

Baby,5.0,long lasting & satisfaction guaranteed.,"My aunt had this for her grandchild. She had let me borrow it for my baby (who is now a toddler). And now my other aunt is borrowing the jumper for her grandchild. I like how well made material on the seat is. The poles that hold up do get wobbly but it still works. I'd definitely say this jumper is a must have if you want a good easy to jump activity toy for your baby. It lasts long too if you want something to keep for your next babies. My toddlers favorite toy was chewing on the butterfly and spinning the sun. The leaves where the stuffed birds on the poles can adjust for babies reach. I should've have known to buy this instead of getting the baby einstein musical motion jumper. Reason why is because the seat on the einstein jumper seam had ripped at 4 days old. The baby seat material is NOT great as this jumper. And it is harder for my baby to jump in it. If you want a good, easy to jump entertainer that lasts long GET THIS ONE. If you want an activity set like the baby einstein jumper that has tons of toys to keep baby entertained go for that. But I'd definitely recommend this jumper. My biggest regret is buying that baby einstein jumper. I hope this review helps."

Only minor complaint is moving the little metal bars to change the height is a major pain and surprisingly challenging. Not a huge deal, though, just some sore fingers afterward.

Baby,5.0,A must-have for new parents!,"These are the cutest and best made chains on the market. I bought this one as we lost our previous Heimess chain.They take a pacifier easily, are non-toxic, they double as a teething toy and the clip is very sturdy. My 14 month old can't pull it off very easily, though sometimes she does succeed. Keeps paci clean and prevents us losing them whilst traveling (always finding them in strange places in the car!). Love it."

I recommend it to all my new parent friends."
Baby,5.0,Wish we had this 25 years ago!,Grandbaby loves this thing!  Started using it at about 5 months and is a jumping fool!  Cracks us up :)  Nice to have a safe place to put him (that he enjoys) for those times that you need to answer the door or use the bathroom or take something out of the oven...
Baby,5.0,Baby's love it,Very nice for baby works real well.
Baby,2.0,But holds everything else great!,Drinks spill everywhere. But holds everything else great!
Baby,5.0,Great toys for babies!,"Our baby loves Doris the Dragon! He played with this toy from age 3 mos through 8 mos, and still shows interest. We also have Terrence the T-Rex and Bart the Butterfly. Bart and Doris seem to be his favorite."
Baby,5.0,Works with Urbo 2,This worked well with our Mamas and Papas Urbo2. We ultimately went with the Skip Hop Grab & Go but this was a totally fine product and a good price.
Baby,5.0,She adores this lil guy!,What would I do without this lil guy! My daughter LOVES him! I had wash and allow it to air dry in front of a fan or something.

Baby,5.0,My son LOVES this. It fit him perfectly when ...,My son LOVES this. It fit him perfectly when he was 4 months old. I has worried it'd still be too big for him
Baby,5.0,I originally planned to pump into storage bags and did ...,"I originally planned to pump into storage bags and did that for a while.  Then I realized I was wasting time and money transferring milk from the pump bottle, into bags and then back into the feeding bottle (Avent Natural).  I decided to start storing in the Avent bottles and these are essential for safely and securely capping the bottles."
Baby,5.0,Love that they fit natural or classic,"Love that they fit natural or classic, I have both styles from getting hand-me-down bottles.  These make my life so much easier as I can pump straight into Avent bottles with my Medela pump using some adapters I bought here on Amazon and then just put these little storage discs in to seal everything up.  Worth the $$."
Baby,3.0,After some time the ibbdns number or ibaby official server ...,After some time the ibbdns number or ibaby official server stopped working and I haven't been able to use this camera in a year.
Baby,5.0,This is probably the greatest gift you can give someone at a baby shower.,If you have a baby or toddler they will absolutely fall in love with these. You will too. We love the monkey-binky and my son can't sleep without it. This is our third wubbanub too.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,A lot smaller than I thought.
Baby,4.0,Pretty good holder,"This worked well on our UPPAbaby Vista.  Four stars because coffee does spill when you go over bumps, but I'm sure that's to be expected and I'm not sure how this design could be improved to eliminate that, although, I did have friends with holder that didn't spill their coffee, so I'm giving this one four stars for that reason."
Baby,4.0,Useful,Very useful
Baby,5.0,Best mobile,Both my girls love this!!! By far the best mobile out there.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome choice for busy boys!  They still love this jumperoo - 5 months later ...

Baby,5.0,It is awesome.,"It is awesome! I bought it for my 5 month old and he plays in it every day! i was initally reluctant to purchase because of the price, but it is very well worth it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves to play with it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 5 month old loves it!!!
Baby,4.0,Nice entertainment for 5 months and up though,"I made this purchase based in so many reviews.  Although many say they have used it with infants under 5 months, I don't see how and that's says a lot since my son has been on the taller side since birth.  Nice entertainment for 5 months and up though.  He loves the music, lights and all the gadgets."
Baby,3.0,Nice,Nice but the sound is very very low .
Baby,5.0,great product. baby loves it non,great product.baby loves it non stop
Baby,5.0,Great Buy,"Love this thing! Great addition to our baby jogger, fits two bottles and other accessories for easy access. Great value for the price!"
Baby,5.0,Great Shower Gift,Mother-to-be was excited about this item.  Will keep the wipes handy when baby comes!
Baby,5.0,We love these pacifiers,"We love these pacifiers. We got one when my son was born and named him George. Which made asking each other easy, &#34;Do you have George?&#34; as we walked out the door. It also helped when it was time to break my son of the pacifier at 19-20 months. We were able to cut the pacifier off and still give him &#34;George&#34;. It only took about 4 days to get him to fall asleep without crying or fussing. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!"
Baby,5.0,Fantastic.,"Excellent product - good quality, sturdy, extremely useful and oh so affordable!"

Baby,4.0,Buy this its cool and lasts,My baby loves it. Still going after almost a year.Havnt changed batteries Yet!!!
Baby,5.0,Cheeful horse learning toy,"I gave this to a horse friend at our farm, she thought it was so cute.  Very colorful, and nice its a learning toy."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Disappointed
Baby,5.0,Best thing ever!,We wub our wubba nubs :)
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,they are great! grandson loves it
Baby,3.0,Nothing exciting but works ok,"I am not a fan of chemicals in baby items, and this reeked of chemicals coming out of the packaging. I left it outside for a few days to off-gas. I thought it was made of nylon/polyester before buying, but the tag says 100% polyurethane...which explains the stink. It's super-handy on my Uppababy Vista for keys, water, phone, etc., though does get in the way when the seat is facing forward. I still usually have the seat facing to me, so not always an issue, but might get in the way for other Vista users. All in all, for the price, and considering similar items are likely made of the same stuff, it's a good buy, but I wish they had used safer materials."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great service. Love this pacifier
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 8 month old granddaughter LOVES it!!
Baby,5.0,Love this Monkey Binky!,"I love this binky!  Since it is attached to a monkey, I never lose it.  The monkey allowed me to &#34;prop&#34; it up so it stayed in my sons mouth and it's heavy enough that he didn't spit it out for fun, but could remove it if he wanted to.  I have washed it a couple of times by throwing it in the washing machine and it was basically dry when I took it out.  My son chewed through the first binky after several months, so I bought a second one.  After he chewed through that one I went to the store and bought the same brand of binkies, but instead of the newborn ones I got the 9+ mo (i think) and removed the old ones and sewed in the new ones.  Now I have backups and since he is done teething, he hasn't chewed through any more."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 3 month old loves his monkey. Well worth it.

He has a great time jumping up and down, and soothes himself by rocking back and forth when he starts to get tired. The only negative comment I have is that the seat doeas not swivel with ease. It's almost as if it needs some form of lubricant for the track."
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Binky detached from the monkey :( my kid was heartbroken

The toys entertain her when she just wants a moment feeling she can stand without having to bouncer.  It amuses her for hours!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,MY KIDS FAVORITE TOY AND HAS NOT GOTTEN OLD. I WILL BE ORDERING MORE AS GIFTS FOR FRIENDS.
Baby,5.0,It's now his favorite toy.,Just what my baby needed! It's now his favorite toy... It helps him to develop different habilities and at the same time he is playing and having so much fun...<br />Definitely meet all of my expectations!
Baby,4.0,One size does not necessarily fit all babies,"Useful, but my son's wrists at 6-8 weeks old are almost too big to close the velcro around. Most of the time I put them on him they fall off within minutes. I don't think these will be usable for us for long."
Baby,5.0,... on my city mini double and it gives me great added space for holding things like a water bottle,"I'm using this on my city mini double and it gives me great added space for holding things like a water bottle, phone, keys, etc.  I like the zipper compartment inside of it too."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Well made and fits perfectly on our city mini stroller.
Baby,5.0,He does/did not like tummy time and was developing a head tilt,"I have used this as a pediatric physical therapist with some of the children I work with. Now I got to purchase one for my first grandson! He does/did not like tummy time and was developing a head tilt. He is making great progress with this, and loves the mirror and crinkly leaves on the play mat."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Babies love WubbaNubs!
Baby,5.0,Sturdy for my hefty 20 pound 4 month old,Sturdy for my hefty 20 pound 4 month old!  His toes didn't quite touch at first so I put a couple rubber mats underneath.  He loves this toy!
Baby,5.0,Cool Jumper,"This is a cool jumper.  We have not had any of the problems described by some of the others.  But, I would always suggest you keep an eye on the child when in any of these."
Baby,5.0,BEST pacifier for an infant,"BEST pacifier for an infant! Our daughter loved to hug hers at 2 months, and loves to rub his little paw between her fingers at 8 months. My only regret is that we didn't get several- when 'monkey' is in the wash, she gets upset and frustrated with her other boring binkies, and they end up under the sofa. ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES, WubbaNubs are genius!"
Baby,4.0,Super cute my son loves it,Super cute my son loves it! I am giving it 4 stars though bc the giraffes neck should pull down to make it longer! Great price and super cute though.
Baby,3.0,Easy to install,"Easy to install, sleek, beautiful. Nice temperature and humidity feature, touch screen scrolling the image with your cell, zooming. The image has a 3 seconds delay from realtime. Big minus: the image isn't continuous in the dark.  The screen goes blank for 5 seconds at a time which can make you apprehensive if the baby is fussing. Also in the back of the camera there's a power light that could be smaller and less bright. The camera doesn't snaps tightly with the crib clip, so beware not to dislodge it and let it fall."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My nephew loved Logan the Lion for years!
Baby,2.0,but the discs are easily pushed in and I would hate to spill precious ...,"I didn't think these were very secure on my Avent Natural bottles. I bought a pump attachment to pump directly into the Avent bottles. I thought these would save some space in my cooler, but the discs are easily pushed in and I would hate to spill precious breastmilk. I ended up throwing these out."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The baby loves this on her carrier/car seat - age appropriate and reasonably priced
Baby,5.0,bouncey bounce,Our little guy loves it. Construction is very good as he put it through quite a workout. The music isn't super annoying so that's nice. Assembly was very easy and it adjusts easily as well. Looked at a bunch and picked this one. Glad I did.
Baby,4.0,great way to see my baby when I'm traveling,"great way to see my baby when I'm traveling.  We have another monitor that we use in random parts of the house, but this is the one that sits by the crib and we use it every night.  Whether in the room next door or a thousand miles away, this thing is awesome."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Son loves this mobile!!!
Baby,3.0,not so great for my stroller,"not so great for my stroller. everytime i fold it, everything falls out. when in reg mode, its not easy to access because of the bumper bar.  probably perfect for an umbrella stroller but not for my babyhome emotion."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My loves loves this product! Fast shipping
Baby,3.0,"Not consistent.  When it works, it's fine but...","It's okay some days. I like the idea, but it frequently shuts the feed off. As a result, we never use it by itself, we always have the audio monitor on too.  For the past few months both my husband and I's iPad's work with it but not the iPhones despite multiple resets and reinstalls on all products.  Seems that with updates there are usually problems.  Even the website viewing is not pulling up now..."

Baby,5.0,It was easy to assemble and work,I got this jumperoo for free to try it out from Bzzagent. It was easy to assemble and work. My 9 month old daughter jumps in it for so long that she falls asleep. She loves to jump. I love the bright colors and the rainforst sounds. It is compact and less cluncky then a swing I had that took up so much space. It grows with her too. I highly recommend this product.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves it!
Baby,5.0,Nice design,"We really liked this for our second kiddo. The design is nice. The height adjustment is a little hard to do, but I would rather it be difficult than to adjust accidentally."
Baby,5.0,Excellent! Our baby loves this,Excellent!  Our baby loves this.  Would suggest for a 5 to 6 month old.
Baby,5.0,looking forward to more fun as he grows,Grandbaby loves this toy! He's 4 months old. This is the first toy he would actually play with. looking forward to more fun as he grows.
Baby,5.0,Niece loved it!,Got this for my niece and she absolutely loved it. She's had it 9 months now and its still in good condition.<br />She loves the bright colours and sounds from the attached toys. So glad I got it for her.
Baby,5.0,super useful! perfect size for my stroller,super useful! perfect size for my stroller! now we have room for my order daughter's water and the baby's bottle!
Baby,5.0,Happy!,Cute! Good purchase!
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,It's ok - I would but something else. Its large and difficult to move from room to room.
Baby,5.0,Best!,After trying several &#34;universal&#34; stroller cup holders - I hit the jackpot with this one. I absolutely love it. I can throw my phone and keys in the large center section and I still have 2 cup holders to stick cups in.  FYI I have a Britax B Agile stroller - and I did try the Britax cup holder first and it broke off after the first time I closed my stroller.
Baby,5.0,Jumperoo,My 6 month old granddaughter gives the jumperoo two thumbs up. She loves it therefore I do too!
Baby,5.0,the best!,"My daughter LOVES this play mat, really well made and beautiful bright colors."
Baby,5.0,Easy to hold onto,Love this pacifier. It doesn't get lost as easily as other pacifiers. My grandson can find it & hold onto it a lot more easily than regular pacifiers.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Doesn't seem to seal well so my wipes dry out.
Baby,4.0,Works but wish it was secure,"These are dual purpose and fit on both the classic and natural bottles. I bought them specifically for the natural bottles.  And while they do work, I wish they snapped into the rings like the old ones used to on the classic bottle rings. On the natural bottles, it kind of just sits in there, but can fall out if the ring isn't screwed onto the bottle and it can shift out of place if you're not careful when putting the lid on. Bottom line is there is no alternative product, and this does NOT dissuade me from using the Avent natural bottles (I LOVE them...much more than the classic bottles)."
Baby,5.0,The best toy i've bought my baby so far,"The look on my baby's face the minute i put him in the jumperoo was priceless! He's 6 months old and loves EVERYTHING about it!! The sounds, the lights, the bouncing...<br /><br />It's very easy to install and is not as big as i imagined (based on reviews, i was a bit worried about the size) which is perfect.<br /><br />It also allows me to leave my baby alone for a minute or two without having to worry he's eaten something off the floor or knocked his head somewhere.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!!"
Baby,5.0,This is one of the best things I've gotten for my daughter,This is one of the best things I've gotten for my daughter. She loves it and it is a part of our day every day. Must have for new moms! Worth the money.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby loves it. Don't put it in the dryer though. I did and the mirror came off
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fun toy with lots of fun stuff and a great price
Baby,5.0,One of baby's favorite toys.,"Around 4 months, my baby decided that he loves this toy! It is currently dangling over his playmat, and he loves to bat at and chew on the legs of this giraffe. Definitely one of his favorites."
Baby,4.0,Almost perfect,"Really awesome! It's nice to have a place to put your phone and wallet. The only problem with it was that with my Graco stroller and the way it was positioned if I put a water bottle in it, it wouldn't work because it hung below the handles."
Baby,5.0,For classic and natural,"These are only for both the classic and natural bottle. I haven't tried the natural style so I can't offer anything on the use of these disc and that bottle style. For the classic, replace the nipple in the screw ring with the disk. It should fit snugly and click or pop when in place. I suggest doing a test run on the disc with water to make sure that they are in place properly. As with the classic, the adapter ring must be in use in order to prevent leakage. I bought extra screw rings myself to make switching from nipple to disc much easier to do while being on the go. Over all, these are a great buy for any mom whose nursing and want to pump directly into the bottle and store.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/5/2017<br />I've now has these sealing disc since late 2014 and I must say that my sealing disc have taken a beating. They have been used with the original classic bottle mostly for storage with the screw rings with no problems. Classic plus I do not own as it would have been a waste of money seeing how my original classics are in good shape.  I did go on to purchase a couple of the natural bottles and these work perfectly fine with that bottle also. The disc in all Avent bottles sticks out in the middle, it isn't a flat sealing disc. It does what it should do, protect mama's liquid gold while in transport or storage. Sealing disc has help up to repeated use, washes and even being in a bottle warmer. If any other parents is breastfeeding and looking for a bottle that can also be used for storage, I would highly recommend Avent bottles/sealing discs!<br /><br />Another thing is that, the price of these is very reasonable and they can be replaced easily if lost for some reason."
Baby,5.0,My baby love this pacifier,Very cute! My baby love this pacifier!
Baby,5.0,5-stars for the Minkey,"This product is awesome. Our newborn son (now 10 weeks old) has been using it for past several weeks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The binky (technically not &#34;the binky&#34;, but a pacifier) itself is highly rated.<br />- The weight of the toy helps keep it in place and prevents from falling off accidentally.<br />- On the flip side, when our son doesn't want it, he is able to easily toss it out.<br /><br />Drawback:<br />- The pacifier is non-detachable which makes it hard to sterilize. We have an electric sterilizer, and we hanging this from outside so that only the pacifier is sterilized, which forces a gap between the lid and the unit - not a big deal though.<br /><br />Workaround:<br />- My wife looked into this and people have hacked it to be detachable. I wish the manufacturer made it that way to begin with.<br /><br />Net-net, our son is (in turn we are) so happy with it, that we're going to get the other animals as well."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"Perfect for our lightweight stroller - fits your phone, snacks, and cup holder."
Baby,5.0,Spinning problem solved and lovely product overall :-),"For anybody who has a problem with this item, in particular the mobile not spinning properly, I wanted to leave this review to help you.    We bought this mobile in 2008, for our daughter, and it always worked fine with no problems.    However, getting it back out for our son in January revealed the seemingly common problem - it appeared as if the big leaves were too heavy, catching on the spinning part and stopping it from moving properly.    I tried bending the leaves back in to shape (it seemed like they weren't in the right position and not moving high enough out of the way) and it seemed to work for a couple of spins, but then it started again.    So I took it apart! Only the motorised bit of course, which can be removed from the base unit.    Inside you will see quite an elaborate cog mechanism, don't take this apart! This is the motor and should still be fine.    You will see how the mechanism works - there is a circular piece of plastic that runs around the inside of the rim and is responsible for the rise and fall of the leaves. You can see the grooves, a pattern of 2 small and 1 big, which is how the leaves behave (2 'jumps' and then they close down once).    The whole inside of the rim should be greased in order for everything to move easily. Over time, this dries out and needs to be replaced (similarly to just about every other electronic item with moving parts). I used petroleum jelly for the job and it's been fine ever since. You can use this, or something similar, but my friend asked me if vegetable/sunflower oil would be okay. Of course, the answer is certainly not! This solidifies in to a resinous substance that will ruin the whole thing (and is also partly why I only use lard or dripping to fry with now, but that's a different story!).    Our son, his mummy and I have been enjoying the mobile ever since :-)    I hope this has helped (or will help) at least one person our there.    The actual product is lovely too - the classical songs and rainforest noises are very calming without being intrusive whilst the movement is gentle and quite mesmerising too! The remote works reasonably well, as long as you aren't too far away, and is rarely needed anyway."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Really nice
Baby,5.0,highly recommended!!!,amazing! My 5 month old loves this will bounce as long as I let her!! My 5 year old had the same one when she was a baby definitely recommend for any parent 😄
Baby,1.0,Too pricey for quality,I give it a low review the Mat is not nearly long enough. It's so short that my 4 month old daughter body Is longer than the mat. So when I prop her on it she's has a great view of the floor !
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Really like the snap strap and the slide up opening.  Very convenient!
Baby,5.0,This is my baby girls favorite! She is 6 months old,"This is my baby girls favorite! She is 6 months old, but we got it when she was 3 months because she clearly wanted to be on her feet. We just used a foot rest underneath till she was able to reach the ground. I can put her in it while I get things done around the house and she is as happy as a clam. She tries to jump even when not in her jumperoo. This is a great gift, love this thing."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,fun thx
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It's so cute.
Baby,4.0,"We used this for our 6 month old, for ...","We used this for our 6 month old, for about a year. We used it to transition to binky only at bedtime &#34;monkey is in bed and waiting for you!&#34;  Our sone would get excited to go to bed with his monkey.<br /><br />Also, when we decided it was time for the binky to go, we just cut off the end and he kept monkey.<br /><br />* put in washer many times (set out to dry)<br />* I am only giving 4 stars because the binky is more for newborns. (Which you aren't supposed to put things in bed with them for SIDS). I wish this came with bunnies for older children.<br />There are others on the market that you can add your own binky, but our son would always take them out of the animal!"
Baby,1.0,Ibaby broken after minimal use.,"My 11 month old baby's nursery is on a different level than our bedroom so it is very important that we have eyes in his room.  I purchased this monitor less than a year ago, and from the moment we plugged it in it has been nothing but a hassle.  The monitor would constantly need to be reinstalled and plugged into my router throughout the ten months we used it and now won't work at all.  I have asked for assistance via the ibaby support page with no response back.  I am very disappointed in this product.  As this is outside of the return window for Amazon this review page is my only outlet to provide feedback."
Baby,5.0,Works great!,"Works great on the Britax B-agile and for the price, it is definitely a steal!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,
Baby,5.0,My son loved his Brown Monkey pacifier,"We purchased this pacifier and the Brown Puppy pacifier for my son, along with other plain Phillips Avent Soothie pacifiers.  The WubbaNubs were by far my son's favorites, especially the Puppy (he even had a name for it), but that was probably because it was the first one we bought for him.  Infants look really cute sucking on these pacifiers and you will get a lot of comments.  We live overseas so you don't see these around here and we got asked many times where we bought them.  Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.  Even though these are easier to keep track of than plain pacifiers, we ended up losing a couple of them and replaced them, and some of the plain pacifiers, with the Brown Monkey, another Brown Puppy, and the Turtle.  We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.  One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.  Did going from the Monkey pacifier to the Monkey blanket make that transition easier?  I don't know...it seemed to us like it did but it's just a single data point."
Baby,5.0,So cute!,So very cute.  It is very entertaining and the music selection is great.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Everything is as expected. No complaints!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Fantastic value, works great!"
Baby,5.0,Works for glass bottles too,I am so glad that we purchased it. I use these sealing disc with my 5 oz Avent glass bottles and Lansinoh Momma bottles while mixing formula to prevent dripping from shaking with nipples on.
Baby,4.0,Deedee,"Great toy. My son enjoys it. He was about 4 months old when we got this. The ball at the end of one of the hands is hard and could be cut off as other reviewers have suggested. It wasn't a problem for my son, but it might be for younger children."
Baby,3.0,would have been good if its activated by movements,"Musical tunes stop playing too soon and have to restart by turning the roll toy on the unit, this cannot be done by infants. would have been good if its activated by movements."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The best
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,This was a gift for a friend. Her baby loves it!
Baby,4.0,Rainforest vs Luv Zoo,"I spend sometime reading review to see which one is better: Rainforest vs Luv Zoo. I bought the Rainforest because there was a review saying that Rainforest's seat turns more easily, and the toys are closer to baby's hand; these aren't true. My 5 month son would never be able to turn the seat by himself, I have to turn it for him. I tried to reinstall it thinking may be fabric stuck on the wheel, but no, it's just how it is. The size of the table is the same, toys aren't closer but he can reach. One negative comment about the Rainforest is that two toys out of 5 are similar; the egg shaped clear plastic which turns, there are two of them. I would rather get Luv Zoo because there are more varieties. He seems to be entertained enough by just jumping, so at minimum, that's the best feature of this product.<br /><br />Another point: I asked a question that if I can take a part once I put together, I have to put them in a suitcase. Two people said yes; not true. You can take the legs a part, but not the toys on the table. Once you set it, it's set. You cannot put them back in a box or in a suitcase. If you are going to take it with you on a flight, don't put them together before you do so."

Baby,5.0,Great little gadget!,Wonderful little jumper! Doesn't take up too much space and the baby loves all the colors of the toys!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,so cute
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works great with our UppaBaby Vista.
Baby,5.0,excellent product recommend,excellent product recommend
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,I like this jumperoo. My baby can play a lot of time in jumperoo. Good product for baby age from 4 month to 8 month.I will definitely recommend it.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,are utililes to store liquids in their bottles
Baby,5.0,Folds up with my stroller,"We bought this stroller organizer to fit the Mountain Buggy Nano.  Although I read other customer reviews saying that you cannot fold strollers while this stroller organizer is still attached, I can fold it attached to the Nano without any issue (I empty the organizer first, of course) and the Nano still fits in the bag it came with while folded with the organizer.  We basically use the organizer to store a water bottle or drink for us, the baby's bottle and our phones.  It is a great addition to our Mountain Buggy Nano so we may end up buying another one for our Bugaboo."
Baby,5.0,sturdy and he fits in it easily at 5 months ...,"I did some research on similar items before I decided to purchase these (2).  I found that many of what the stores have to offer are too bulky or expensive.  I was looking for something semi-comfortable for my son.  It's well made, sturdy and he fits in it easily at 5 months and just under 17 lbs with room to grow.  He gets a lot of entertaining exercise and fun for 30-45 mins at a time.  He loves it.  I was a bit disheartened that the tiger on one of them came broken.  It happened to be the one I gave to his daycare provider and it was set up and ready to go when I saw it so, I did not return it.  Other than than I am very pleased."
Baby,5.0,A Must for anyone's baby registry,"We have about 5 different types of pacifiers, and this ended up the only one being used because we can actually find it (unlike the other dozen that end up underneath blankets and in between cushions).  At two months, the baby has started to hold onto the arms and legs of the monkey and play with it, happy to be able to grab something.  We'll probably get another one as a back up.<br /><br />I'd put the WubbaNub a requirement to purchase prepping for a baby's arrival."
Baby,5.0,So happy received the package this afternoon,"So happy received the package this afternoon! Beautiful fisher-Price toys for my daughter, and it's easy to assemble. I think my daughter will love it."
Baby,5.0,Very pleased.,Works well. Very pleased.
Baby,5.0,Great Toyama good quality,"My little one loves this giraffe! I had the same one for my three yr old when he was little and wanted to get the sane one for the new baby. Great Toyama good quality, baby loves the colors!"
Baby,4.0,"Cute, soft, inexpensive toy","My almost 5 month old seems to like this. The legs and neck are easy for his tiny hands to grip. The neck has elastic and can stretch slightly. The body makes a crinkling noise and the &#34;feet&#34; are different toys - one rattle with tags, one mirror, one flat teether, and one ring with two smaller movable rings. So far he only hugs and grips the toy but the fact that he shows interest in it at his age makes it a good toy to me. I bought it to entertain him in his car seat (while connected to his stroller, not in the car) but it hangs too low and gets in his face. We have a Graco Snugride. I attach it to his swing or bouncer sometimes, but for the most part he just plays with it when it's not attached to anything."
Baby,3.0,a huge pain to adjust the height,"This is a fun toy, but whoever designed this thing truly hates parents and wants them to suffer. If there is a hell, it is a place where you'll be forced to continually put together and adjust Fisher-Price toys. And whoever designed this thing will for sure be there. You have to thread a metal bar through a loop in a thick strap, and you have like one millionth of a millimeter to get it right. Meanwhile, you're sweating and your baby, who has previously shown no interest in the toy and in fact cries any time you even hover her over it, is wailing in your ear and pulling all your hair out in a fit of rage because it's been 15 minutes and you're on strap 1 of 3 and she really needs to use the Jumperoo. And then you finally get the first one done! Actually that wasn't so bad and now you've figured out a strategy and the next 2 are going to be a breeze. But wait. Somehow, whatever strategy you've figured out doesn't work now and you're back to the drawing board. 30 minutes later, after unimaginable sweating and frustration, you've done it and you're not even happy or relieved. You're numb. You place your baby in the Jumperoo and imagine that you'll finally have the next 10 minutes free so that you can drink. Or just cry. But wait. Actually, she wasn't ready for level 3 height. Well, best of luck to you."
Baby,5.0,"love it, I use it for my quinny stroller ...","love it, I use it for my quinny  stroller fits just right. just has to remove it when folding the stroller but it fits in any purse or diaper bag. got it just on time for my Vancouver and Seattle trip. perfect for bottles and coffee cups. fast delivery"
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,My baby didn't like it. .. compare to the bright stars
Baby,5.0,They look like they are having so much fun,I have a daycare and my babies loves this!!  I would purchase another one.  I have no problems out of it.  I saw a review where it was pinching the children.  I looked all over it when I got mine and did not see where that could happen.  My infants jump with such ease.  They look like they are having so much fun!!
Baby,5.0,Buy 2 of them!,"It's very cute but I can't attest yet to how well it works since I have a few months before baby arrives. :)  My only complaint so far though is that it seems like it's not as good of quality as it looks in the picture. The colors are slightly off or something. It's still really cute but I'm not sure if the quality has changed since these first came out. We'll see how it holds up, I'll try to keep my review updated after it's been washed and such.  UPDATE: 7/29/2015 My little one is now almost 6 months old and LOVES his wubby (as we call it). The only problem is that he won't part with it so I think I might have to buy a second one so that I can actually wash it. lol"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,it's ok
Baby,5.0,Great Bouncer!,Great fit for baby. Seat not too deep and toys in good places.
Baby,5.0,So cute,We haven't tried the monkey yet but we have the giraffe and my son loves it even at a month old he wrapped his little arms around it while sucking it washes well too
Baby,3.0,The legs aren't stretchy. Which is strange since someone ...,The legs aren't stretchy. Which is strange since someone asked that specific question and said yes they were. Whatever
Baby,5.0,so cute,I also grabbed this for my nephew and I know he's going to love it.
Baby,4.0,Worthwhile investment,"The only baby toy my daughter can stand. It still could use a few more bells and whistles, hence the loss of 1 star."
Baby,5.0,Love it,My son loves it. We named it monkey and monkey goes everywhere my son goes. It's also very easy to find
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,good but big for baby under 4 months
Baby,5.0,If baby is happy then I'm really happy! :),I dont know what it is about this giraffe but my baby loves him. He will play with this thing and not get sick of it. Lots of different textures and things to keep him entertained.
Baby,5.0,Highly recommend,My 8 week old loves to just hang out for 10-20 minutes at a time. There's a lot to look at and it's sturdy.
Baby,1.0,One Star,"it opens too easily, dropping the wipes in the floor."
Baby,5.0,We bought this when out baby was 5 months old ...,"We bought this when out baby was 5 months old. He is just over 7 months now and still loves it. We are on the highest height adjustment now, so not sure how much longer we can keep using this."
Baby,1.0,NEVER BUY THIS - Terrible Customer Service from Withings & Amazon,"I would not recommend this product to anyone for any reason. This product is marketed and sold as a high end baby monitor, and it's been anything but that in our experience. After 2 years of almost constant disconnecting (it operates on your home wifi network), it is finally just completely dead and doesn't work at all. It required constant rebooting of our electronic devices to reset the program in order for us to be able to see our baby.<br />In addition to a poor quality product, Withings literally DOES NOT allow customer service phone calls. I have never experienced such a thing in my life - especially with products that are sold at this price point. As I am currently on bed rest awaiting our new baby's arrival, I attempted to contact them to see how they could help me solve for a product that literally no longer works at all. The only option they provided to me was back and forth emailing with delays, and multiple requests for troubleshooting my device and sending them pictures at each juncture. I have never experienced such poor customer service; it's unthinkable to operate this way for a device that is directly tied to baby/child safety. Certainly this is unacceptable for baby industry items. As a final blow, they have offered me 25% off the purchase price of a new device. Is this a joke?? I would never PURCHASE another Withings item at all.<br />In addition, I must say I have been equally disappointed with Amazon customer service in this as well. Amazon was unwilling to accept a return (30 day return policy on baby items) despite the unique circumstances. Amazon was also unable to provide me with a customer service number for Withings. I told my Amazon customer service agent that I could not imagine allowing sales from vendors for which you could not literally contact by phone. I would expect Amazon to hold their sellers to a higher standard for customer service. I am familiar that other retailers like Target, Bed, Bath & Beyond, and even Walmart have standards for requiring this of vendors. When I asked to speak with a Customer Service manager at Amazon, she ended up giving me a phone number for a seller of other Withings products, but when I contacted them, they told me they had never actually sold the Smart Baby Monitor device, and they were unsure why Amazon would have given me their phone number.<br />In summary, I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. Buy a great baby monitor from companies that stand behind their products (Summer, Phillips, etc), and purchase from a retailer with reasonable return policies who also require their suppliers to maintain customer service."
Baby,5.0,Soothing Super Monkey,My daughter fell in love at first sight. She always falls asleep with her monkey.
Baby,5.0,We hung this on our infant carseat and then the ...,"We hung this on our infant carseat and then the stroller. Now, I attach it to his shopping cart cover. This can be attached everywhere and my child loves it. The mirror has &#34;melted&#34; and you cannot see anything in it anymore, but he still loves it!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome fit for my son.  I loved it!
Baby,3.0,I purchased it because I wanted a way to monitor my baby through iPhone and this one was the best one ( and most expensive) at t,"I have had this product for some time now. This products is ok.  I purchased it because I wanted a way to monitor my baby through iPhone and this one was the best one ( and most expensive) at the time.<br /><br />Pros:  1) connectivity to your phone or tablet rather then a specific monitor. 2) Decent picture quality day and night.  3) Some extra features like the light and music.<br /><br />Cons: 1) limited angles due to the type of base/support that is provided with the product.  so it needs to be fixed at a certain angle on the crib, and not easy to change the angle.  2) when the wifi router in my home resets I have issues with trying to reconfigure it to be detected from my iPhone or iPad again.  So there are connectivity issues sometime 3) Recently my baby pulled the adapter plug out of the back of the unit and damaged the connector at the base of the unit and also the adapter head.  Both will need to be changed.<br /><br />I suggest the company redesign the product with the above points in mind."
Baby,1.0,Not a great product from a company I usually purchase from,"Does not seal, and red slide button falls off. Not a great product from a company I usually purchase from."
Baby,5.0,Very cute!  Interesting and fun toy for my 6 month old :),Favorite toy!!  For my baby.... and then for my puppy lol  She stole it while we weren't looking.  Baby loved it until the attack.
Baby,5.0,So satisfied with very instant delivery,"Sorry for belated reply, was on vacation.<br />So satisfied with very instant delivery, well packed.<br />Love this item and always buy it for all my friends who has small babies.<br />Like to deal with this seller, and will order again for upcoming baby showers.<br />Thanks a lot!"
Baby,5.0,GOOD,Like it. Not so big. It holds my keys and small things.
Baby,1.0,Save your $$- didn't work well even once for me. Not worth the hassle.,"Useless. It is really much bigger than it needs to be. Not compact or discreet in any way. I bought this before my baby was born-- I put wipes in it and tried to use it on 3 or 4 occasions but the red &#34;button&#34; that has to be slid over to get the wipes out was too hard to move-- which is definitely NOT something you want to deal with in a public restroom and you are trying to change a diaper. I tried to get it to work after that experience but it didn't loosen up any. After a second frustrating experience at a public bathroom-- I took this out of my diaper bag permanently. A few or two later I came across this and all the wipes were dried out. Just stick with the portable, disposable wipes with the hard plastic open/close feature (target brand , pampers and huggies all have these). They will be MUCH easier to use-- and the wipes case diminishes in size as you use them- and you can throw away the bag when you are done.<br /><br />Save your $$- skip this one. It isn't helpful. If I had purchased this in a store locally, I would have retuned it for a refund. As it was, didn't think it was worth paying shipping costs via Amazon to send it back,"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,awesome
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson Logan couldn't be without it
Baby,5.0,Loves these little WubbaNub pacifiers!!!!,Can't wait for my grand daughter to get her little hands on this one. She has most of them but laid them out for all of us to see.  She's a nut!
Baby,5.0,Perfect,Works perfect on my BOB stroller.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,easy to install. Easy to wash. Very useful.
Baby,4.0,Great for breast milk storage,"I wish I would have known about these sealing discs after I had my first child. These discs are great for sealing bottles you will just be using for storage and for placing on the larger bottles if you don't want to purchase nipples to go on extra bottles. I purchased some bottles at a garage sale and threw away the nipples, sanitized the bottles and used these discs to use them for storage. Easy to pop out of the bottles and clean."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Received today form my niece's christmas looks good
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves sir prance a lot.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Serves its purpose
Baby,5.0,Great,Huge hit with my 8 month old - it hangs on the car seat.
Baby,5.0,Favorite of both babies and adults!,"We had a different color combo, but I can tell you that the FP Jumparoo is a favorite of everyone!  Both of my babies loved it, and it was great to transition them off their backs.  Its great for strengthening babies legs, and gives them motivation for upper body strengthening as well.  My kids, 3 years apart, were opposite with their likes/ dislikes (swing, bouncy, etc) but both were thoroughly entertained by this toy.<br /><br />It takes less space then the excersaucer and the step n play piano which we also tried.  Neither had the enjoyment impact of this toy.  Guests, especially grandparents, loved seeing my kids in this, and no visit was complete without some jumparoo time.  The baby has such a great time in it, and just watching them jump in this contraption would brighten anyone's day and make you laugh!  Highly recommended!"
Baby,5.0,Can't beat the price!,Great product and great value. Fits perfectly my Joovy Qool. Adjustable straps make it easy to use with I would assume any stroller. Never made a better purchase!
Baby,5.0,but I am glad I did,"I got this on a whim because Amazon said &#34;people who buy your stroller also get&#34;, but I am glad I did.  It is really nice to have a place to stick stuff if your stroller doesn't already have built in cup holders.  This one is nice too because you can toss in drinks and your cell phone and keys or whatever else you might need as you are pushing the stroller around. Definitely worth the price."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Best camera

Baby,3.0,I cannot use it while I am out of town ...,"I cannot use it while I am out of town. Also, it does not video what is happening. It only shows movement, does not record movement for later viewing!"
Baby,3.0,"Ok, not great for chubby legs","The toys on this kept my son entertained, and he loved to jump. He was constantly knocking off the two leaf toys on the support arms, however. Also, the leg holes on this are much, much tighter than I've noticed in any other jumper or exersaucer. Getting my son in and out was a challenge and sometimes I worried he would get his circulation cut off. I stopped using it after a while because of this concern."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Girls will love it
Baby,3.0,"replaced the soothe with a nuk, it's perfect now!","I was soo excited about this, but when we got it my daughter didnt like the soothe on it, i ended up putting a nuk on instead. She sleeps with her monkey all the time now! the stuffed animal is very cheap and needed to have part of the tail sewn back together within a week of having it. but i love this toy!!"
Baby,4.0,Great!,"I use it on a chicco liteway mostly. I also attach it to shopping carts to hold my drink/phone/list/coupons out of kid reach. Only reason it's not 5 stars is that it collapses, isn't crush resistant. Also after a yeast + the Velcro is looking worn (and I don't un-Velcro often as I can just slide the loops off of my stroller handles."

Baby,5.0,Great exercise for her,"Our 9 month old loves this! Great exercise for her, worth all the smiles😊"
Baby,5.0,Adorable!!,"Put it together without instructions and within 10 min.  My 4.5 month old isnt sure what to make of it but he didnt scream, so thats a plus.  Takes 3 AA batteries (best to put those in before you snap that part on)..  It's very colorful.  My little man loves the hanging parrot.<br />He just got onto the height-scale (he was a preemie) so he cant touch yet even on the lowest setting and being 14lbs.  For now ive got a 3 inch box under it.<br /><br />Update!:: My little man loves it!!  About a week after I got it he hit a growth spurt and now he can reach.  He bounces like crazy.  He even falls asleep in it!  This is definitely a must have!"

Baby,5.0,Great product and very easy to assemble,My 5 month old daughter has a blast in this toy. And I have a blast watching her! Great product and very easy to assemble!
Baby,4.0,Long legs...,"This toy is very eye catching! Lots of colors and as displayed, a variety of activities to play with. I love the fact that it has velcroe, so I can attach it easily to my car seat. The only thing  that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that the toy is a bit TOO long. When I attached it to my car seat, the legs sometimes hit my son in the face. Yes, the long legs make it able for him to reach and grab it, but if I hit one wrong bump, the toy goes flying right into his face. Its about a 8 inch or so toy so its very long."
Baby,5.0,Best purchase ever,"Best purchase ever! I bought the Jumperoo for my 6 month old baby who could stay seated without support at the time. I had to put a box (2&#34; thick) under his feet as he was still too short to touch the ground (my baby was on the smaller side then). With time, he started to play and discover different activities within the Jumperoo. Initially, he liked to pull and chew on the butterfly. Then he discovered the rolling wheel. Just recently, he realized the elephant could turn towards him if he just pulled on the ear. He just turned 9 months old and discovered the relationship between pushing a button and making the head of a tiger peek out from behind. He can wildly jump in this jumperoo and play with all the attached toys for almost 30 minutes. His leg muscles have gotten stronger as a result. A good way to get my baby tired before a nap. We never put the batteries into the jumperoo as I saw no need. I am guessing it helps play music and turn some lights on?"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works great on our single Bob stroller and is a much better price than the others!
Baby,5.0,So fun to jump and play with the toys,Our son loves loves loves this. So fun to jump and play with the toys. Started using it at 5.5 months.  Great price.  Sturdy. Does not take up too much room. Easy to put together. Baby and mommy approved.

Baby,5.0,best accessory,super practical and keeps organized!!! i love it!!
Baby,1.0,Really wanted to love this,"My son absolutely hated this from the get-go.<br />he is four months old and 26 inches and his toes do not even reach the ground!! He was very uninterested in any of the toys except for the parrots and geicko that hang from the top. He actually cried a few minutes after being placed in the jumper.<br /> As soon as I put him in I had a lot of issues getting him in. The seat was too small and he barely fits. He is a slightly over average baby. I do not like the safety hazard as his hand almost got stuck on the thing with the elephant and little jungle animals. I do not like that there are only three springs that are supporting him. In all, I really wanted to love this product but it just was not happening."
Baby,3.0,Cute but dying,Really cute but the motor seems to be dying after just a few months. It isn't the batteries. We took off one of the leaves bc the motor can't lift all of them at the same time. :(

This is eith a second (reject) or a knock-off.  I do not recommend this seller.  We have lots of these Lamaze toys and I think the brand is good, but this one ended up in the trash.

She finds all the toys very interesting especially the one with music and lights. Even the hanging toys are pretty attractive to her. Overall a very good product, no hassles in assembling. Good quality and very sturdy. Baby happy, parents happy !"
Baby,5.0,Best investment ever,Best investment ever.  My son loves his monkey and it holds up great. Does great in the washer. I have 3 of them for him so we can interchange them.  Love that we never lose it and that it allows my son to manipulate it to sooth himself. Highly recommend!!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very entertaining for our 11 week old Grandson
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,love it
Baby,5.0,great product,Can fit a good amount of wipes in the case and it keeps them most.  Better yet I can use with one hand when the other is trying to hold my daughter.  The red lid pops off easily and it occupies my daughter's hands as well
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product and shipped on time! Thanks!
Baby,3.0,no wort it,"I was expecting a lot for this item, is to big kind of bulky, I ended opened every time I need a wipe because the red botton is kind of complicated to get the wipes, not to many wipes fits in there I think I prefer the little bag from Huggies."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 5 month old son loves this!
Baby,4.0,I don't know how he liked it I'm giving to him for Christmas I'm sure ...,I don't know how he liked it I'm giving to him for Christmas I'm sure he will love it
Baby,5.0,Love it!,My twins love this jumperoo!  They love bouncing in it and the toys are really entertaining for them.  I love that the seat spins and is very padded.  I think this has helped them both gain good muscle tone in their legs.  They have been enjoying this since they were 5 months old!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"best recommended, my sister loved it for her child! worth the buy."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,so much fun for my 5-month old nephew!
Baby,4.0,I am decently pleased with this jumper,"I am decently pleased with this jumper. It is rather hard to move from room to room, even with the folding feature.<br />Other than that, I don't have any complaints and my daughter really loves it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Our little one loves this! Well worth spending a little extra.
Baby,5.0,"Save $, buy this one!",This drink carrier was recommended to me and I have to say it's a great purchase. I have a Baby Jogger City select and this carrier works great for it. I liked it so much that I reordered it after mine was accidentally broken.<br />If you're buying for a city select just be aware of the fact that you'll most likely have to pull the handle on the stroller all the way out when the drink carrier is on it if you have an infant seat in the top position. (i.e. Infant carrier and the second seat.)
Baby,1.0,Stopped working completely.  Look elsewhere for a baby monitor.,"This was given to us as a gift after reading about it and requesting it for our baby on the way.  When we purchased it we were under the impression the company supported Android devices.  After receiving it we tried time and time again to get this to work with our Galaxy S5s to no avail.<br />I emailed the company about this and after no real luck I received an email weeks later from Withings that stated, &#34;at this time the Android app is not our top priority&#34;.  For a decided costing north of $200 and we'll over the market average it better be your priority.<br />We really wanted to use this device because of how well we were told it worked with Apple devices.<br />We have now purchased two Ipod touches to use specifically for this baby monitor.  For the most part we are happy with this devices capabilities.  You can charge the battery and unplug it and place it in differnt places easily.<br /><br />You may be wondering why it is receiving 1 star.  This is why: After my interaction with the company I cannot in good faith recommend this to someone else.  Android OS is the most popular mobile OS in the world and they do not support it.  In fact, just yesterday my wife Uninstalled and tried to reinstall the app and it had been removed from the Play Store.  I am afraid to upgrade the iOS on our ipods because I fear losing compatibility with the monitor.  After speaking with the company I think it is reasonable to expect this is a possibility.<br /><br />Buyer beware.  Look for another device.  Unless you are okay with terrible customer service for any issues you may have.  They have no phone number to contact.  Email only.  And take a long time to respond.<br /><br />UPDATE: Baby monitor stopped working completely.  Will not turn on.  No responses.  Paper weight."
Baby,5.0,Perfection at a 1/3 of the price,"The best and affordable one, why buy the baby jogger original one when this is the same for a third of the price. Fits great for the city mini, and collapses with no extra space."
Baby,5.0,Great Price and does not take up to much space!,"ordered this after my 5 month old tried it in his friends house.  Arrived very quickly, great price and I assembled it myself within 30 minutes. Very sturdy and provides alot of entertainment, although LO gets tired after about 15mins, then sleeps soundly!  Up until this point he was not really moving alot, and so had irregular bowel movements, but since playing in this, I have noticed more dirty diapers!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very straight-forward product. Very strong velcro straps. No complaints on it so far.
Baby,5.0,love it!,"Great fun!  I put it on my son's car seat.  He can reach and look at it and play with it.  I have caught him hanging on to it with a death grip.  He is only 3 months old so there is plenty of room for him to grow into it, but he has already taken an interest in it."
Baby,5.0,Great!,My baby is 5 months and loves this jumperoo! She would stay in it all day if I let her! Great price too!
Baby,5.0,A great addition for an active baby!!,"I'm SOOO glad I decided to go for this despite yet another piece of baby gear cluttering up our apartment. Our little guy was starting to show signs of being bored with his swing and seemed to want more action. The first time we put him in (he was 5.5 months old--now he's at the ripe old age of 6 months :) ), he cried and I thought I'd wasted $70. But the second time (and every time thereafter) he started bouncing in it...and now, after two weeks of daily use, he'll try to bounce as soon as little tushy hits the seat (even if I'm still getting his other leg through the opening)...and with the bounces come a face that is just one big giant lit-up grin. If we look at home WHILE bouncing he will bounce higher and giggle. He's not super interested in all the toys yet but just for the bounces (and being able to put him down in a place that is safe and makes him excited!) it's been worth every penny. Only minor changes I'd  make are 1. Make it easier to move around/store.... (if that's possible without affecting safety/stability) and 2. Add a few rings so that we could add our own toys. Oh and while I'm designing the perfect jumparoo it'd be great if the animal toys (monkey, elephant, bird) would play the appropriate animal sound when the baby interacted with them. But these really are minor quibbles; even as is its already been a great addition to our mini baby store--er, that is, living room. :)<br />If you, like us, have a baby that already seems to like to move and squiggle and be more active, I would HIGHLY recommend this jumparoo. Thanks Fisher Prics!!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it.
Baby,5.0,Good buy!,Great little toy!  Grandson is 10 months old and loves it!
Baby,5.0,This product is so great. My baby loves biting on the monkey itself,My daughter loves it !! This product is so great. My baby loves biting on the monkey itself. This also helps keeping the soother in her mouth when she is try to sleep. I am ordering another one.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My boys love it...
Baby,4.0,WubbaNub Brown Monkey,It is so cute!  I couldn't decide which animal to get for my grandson!  He loves it!
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Not a great fit. Cheap but doesn't hold drinks very well. Should have bought the britax.
Baby,1.0,Skip me,Wipes dry out
Baby,1.0,"NOT FOR FAT BABIES, also putting pieces back for return is nearly IMPOSSIBLE","I really should have read and believe the review about big babies won't fit into this thing...my son's weight is at the 95 percentile and his legs won't fit in it. Also, this thing is not very fun for babies..at least for my son. I found them very boring too, and the  return is such a hassle because once you put the pieces together there is NO WAY to take some of these things out and fit them in to the box. I would STRONGLY suggest you to try it at the store instead of buying from Amazon."
Baby,5.0,no regrets on this jumperoo!,"Love it, kid loves it!  My child has fallen asleep is this jumperoo many times!  It is a great quality product.  Lots of activities and gives a great workout!  Would recommend to anyone with a kid!  I hesitated to buy this because I thought my child was a little small (4mos.) but it is a snug fit and worked out awesome.  Great for an infant that has head control and is not quite mobile yet!  Simple to put together."
Baby,4.0,Excited my little one when i put these on her ...,Excited my little one when i put these on her wrists. she goo'd and gaa'd at them for hours. the velcro was not to catchy though -- had to re attach several times.
Baby,5.0,Great for the littles,Great paci. Our son has loved this since he was an infant. We liked that he could find it if it fell out in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Only bad thing is that he's super attached to &#34;Monk&#34; and will be a difficult habit to break :)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 month nephew loves it.
Baby,5.0,Not cat proof...,"Daughter loves it, just make sure you don't let the cat get ahold of it.  We had 2 and one bit the dust do to a cat thinking they could chew on it too... :("
Baby,5.0,my daughter says one of her best help items for oliver,our grandsonl loves this jumper...keeps him busy with a lot of noise and lights.....my daughter says one of her best help items for oliver ...would highly recommend this product....also it has height adjustment so as he grows it can still be used.....
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,fits two drinks and a bunch of other stuff
Baby,5.0,Love the disks,Love the disks.. Was exactly what I was looking for.. Fits perfect on the ring of my bottles. Good quality plastic.. Serves the purpose and doesn't leak
Baby,5.0,Great for baby!,Our daughter loves this jumper! She is four months and can easily interact with all the different features. She is just a little too short so we put a pillow under her feet to support her a little more. She can be in here 15-30 minutes usually before getting bored or overstimulated.
Baby,1.0,Totally unreliable,"I received this as a gift. I was so excited about it, but the fact that it constantly disconnects and buffers is unacceptable. It's one job is to monitor the baby and it fails. I don't care about white noise and charts and night vision if I can't reliably monitor my baby."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,in love with this item ! the fastest shipping ever seen!!
Baby,5.0,Best purchase so far,Best purchase so far. Baby loves to bounce in the jumperoo which allows me 20-30 minutes to get things done.
Baby,5.0,Baby gets tired before ever getting bored - which is very possible with baby toys,"Grandson LOVES this Jumperoo!!!  The seat turns to three different &#34;play stations.&#34;  One of the stations is interactive so when he jumps, it lights up and plays music.  Baby gets tired before ever getting bored - which is very possible with baby toys.  Relied on the reviews and their recommendations really came through!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Smaller than expected.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Happy, my baby loves it!"
Baby,4.0,Great quality and it's a fun toy that my boys ...,Great quality and it's a fun toy that my boys loved for a while. It only gets four stars since it seems to be very nose heavy and my boys didn't find it amusing having the horses nose in their face constantly.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Babies everywhere will enjoy this magnificent product... They jus go bouncy bouncy... :-)
Baby,2.0,Great customer service for a mediocre product,"If given the choice, I'd probably go with a different unit. While the bells and whistles are really cool when they work, the price is probably not worth your hassle. We are on our third unit, since the first two have failed. The first one stopped connecting entirely, and in the second, the charging housing on the unit has come lose. To their credit, withings has great customer service and despite this being a gift (hence no proof of purchase) they've replaced our unit (twice now)."
Baby,3.0,"Features liked, durability contains room for improvement","I like it. All the features are loved by me and my family, but unfortunately it went wrong two times during the first year (picture was running in night mode)."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These are truly the best items for any baby! This was a super cute design for a boy
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,my grandson is teething and really likes chewing this one.
Baby,4.0,A gift all moms should by themselves!!!,The BEST thing to keep a baby entertained is one of these. Skip the exersaucers and go for the jumperoos. The seat spins and I put it together in 10 minutes (I'm not at all talented in that area but it was easy!) I do worry about how long he can use it because the seat is a tad small and some of the toys are a snooze but I haven't seen a jumperoo yet that hit it out of the park in that department. It doesn't take up a ton of space like others do and the bright colors are really cute. It is one of my son's favorites and it was really a gift to myself because I can get some things accomplished while he jumps away.. and he's happy. The price point is right on.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Small and strong

Baby,5.0,Helps Gives Sense of Security,My son loves his WubbaNub so much I had to share with others and purchased this one for a gift.  I've noticed having something on his chest gives him security at night.
Baby,5.0,The pacifier you can't lose,Best pacifier EVER! We go through 5 pacifiers a week until someone got us this as a present. It is the only pacifier that stayed with us for six months. Attaching a stuffed animal to it is genius.
Baby,2.0,does not fit the uppa cruz stroller since the stroller ...,"does not fit the uppa cruz stroller since the stroller is wider, so it seem to dangle by the edge of the strap ends."
Baby,5.0,Entertainmente Galore,my nephew loves to put things in his mouth and this is perfect and safe for him (he is 8 months) and keeps him occupied in the stroller or the carry on carriage.
Baby,5.0,Best baby monitor ever,"Best baby monitor ever. Not only can my husband and I see it from downstairs, my mother can see if from a different state and my mother-in-law can see if from a different COUNTRY!! Great quality picture and I like the reading on temp and humidity so I'm not guessing if my baby is comfortable. On top of that, customer service is great. The monitor stopped working six months in, and they were so helpful in getting up back up. I wouldn't use anything else."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great for hand to eye coord5ination. Fun colors and good size. 5 month old loves it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,LOVED IT

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,adorable
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby niece loves her jumper.
Baby,5.0,"Great pacifier and a great ""collectible""!","These are great, and my grandson loves them!  There is an entire menagerie of animals to choose from, but be aware that there are two different age groups for the pacifiers.  I would think that the added weight of the animal would be a problem, but so far it it not.  It makes it easier for parents to hold on to, also, and it doesn't fall out of baby's mouth so easily when they're sleeping."
Baby,5.0,So happy about this purchase,I am so happy I decided to buy this for my son for Christmas! He is a momma boy and likes to be the center of attention and I can actually get a few things done while he plays in this! The music and toys are awesome! The seat turns and there are toys all around him so it definitely keeps his attention. I do wish the seat would turn more easily. I have to do it for him right now so I'm not sure if it's because he's too small (6 months) or if it will always be like that. But he definitely enjoys himself in this!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my kid loves it!!!
Baby,4.0,A winner,Baby loves this thing.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,It was way smaller than I anticipated. It just seems cheaply made for the price.
Baby,5.0,Toy-Sir prance,"This little appreciable horse, was the great companion for several nights of my small, the most impressive is that spill more than food and liquids, as its fabric is waterproof and does not absorb almost anything and remains free of stains. It may be the best toy to overcome sit alone in his room."
Baby,4.0,Good even if u only can use it for a little while,Love this contraption started using it when bb was 6 months and he's now 11. Been using it less and less now. But when I first used it it tired him out so much I have pics of him falling asleep in it. Also is nice cause it buys me some time where I don't have to be watching him constantly and I can set him somewhere. Although at 11 months he's having none of that.
Baby,4.0,Does the job,"Holds a lot, but looks kind of shabby on the Uppababy Vista. Sad, but true. I have gotten compliments from other moms about how much stuff I can hold though."
Baby,1.0,Extremely disappointed This is not the real thing,"Extremely disappointed<br />This is not the real thing. I can't be sure about the monkey part since I haven't seen another one but the pacifier is NOT a real soothie, which makes me think the whole thing is fake.<br />P"
Baby,5.0,We love this,"My 8 month old, &#34;high needs&#34; baby absolutely loves this thing!  She took right to it.  We bought it to replace her doorway bumbly that would have been great too  except she was in danger of bumping her head repeatedly on the doorjams (we didn't know that not all doorways are wide enough to use those safely).  She tends to get bored or frustrated quickly with amusements in general (walker, teethers, rattles, swing, etc) but she's had this one for over a week, uses it daily and hasn't slowed down yet.  Plus the music and lights are less obnoxious for us than others out there, the jungle animal noises interspersed with the music just add a note of hilarity to the sight of a maniacly jumping baby lol. She's also quite tall--in the 98th percentile, and already wearing 12 month clothing--and she fits comfortably in this with lots of room and not even on the highest setting yet,  so it should last.  Just really happy with it in general, and so is she."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son absolutely loves it!
Baby,5.0,You won't be disappointed!!!,"This product is wonderful.  My son LOVES this product and gets so excited just seeing it, that he will start to jump and bounce in my arms.  Would definitely recommend this and buy it again."

Baby,1.0,Do not waste your money,"Do not waste your money. Worked once and never more. After contacting the support the firtst thing they said is that they do not garantee this product because it is an old model. After many tries, it never connected again. The camera is not reconized."
Baby,1.0,One Star,Doesnt work
Baby,5.0,"Thought it was a gimmick, turned out to be pretty decent.","My kid loves this.  He gets to snuggle a monkey and suck on a pacifier at the same time, what more could a baby want?<br /><br />Your kid is going to chew the feet, face, tale etc at everyo opportunity, this results in a soggy WubbaNub in short order.  recommend buying a couple of these so you can change them out when they get nasty.<br /><br />Easy to find when it gets lost in a car seat, easy to prop so the kiddo can get it back if it does slip out, and easy to hand back while in car.<br /><br />It is also easy for him to get frustrated and pull the monkey and everything out when you are in front seat and can't get turned around to help, be warned, it's a double-edged sword, but I think it still gets a 5-Star even with that little flaw."

Baby,5.0,Saved the day!,"We had the dragon one of these but my little one bit the end of the paci off and he doesn't sleep with out it. :( so we got a new one, the monkey.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves it!
Baby,5.0,This will be their favorite toy,I saw why the reviews for this particular animal we're so high. Not sure what is about the little yellow fellow. But it was my three month old son's favorite toy for months.
Baby,3.0,It was a great mobile for my first baby,"It was a great mobile for my first baby. She loved it and kicked actively when it operated. The remote is really handy and the main reason I bought it.<br /><br />However, the battery dead pretty soon (3 D batteries for only a month or so). And after several months, the leaves do not lift up after one cycle and I have to manually lift it so that it spins again. I would look for another less complicated mobile for my 2nd baby."
Baby,4.0,Our daughter absolutely loved this up until around 7/8 months (she's 9 months ...,Our daughter absolutely loved this up until around 7/8 months (she's 9 months now).  Now that she's mobile she doesn't like being it anymore and gets bored with it.  Before she could spend anywhere from 20-40 minutes it just smiling away and helped us get stuff done around the house.
Baby,4.0,Neither of them are perfect and I ended up liking this one the least ...,"I originally purchased an Evenflo Jump and Jam exersaucer but didnt think it was bouncy enough so I purchased this one as well.  Neither of them are perfect and I ended up liking this one the least so I sent it to the grandparents for use there.  My son is 8.5 months old now so we have gotten plenty of use out of them.  I love how bouncy this one is however it is supposed to make noise with every jump and it does not.  I assume this is a defect, but there was no way I was going to be able to fit this back in the box due to the large rainbow clicked into the seat so I didnt exchange it.  The leg holes and seat seemed tight on my baby and he isnt even chubby.  The seat is hard for him to spin so that doesnt happen much.  He enjoys spinning the roller and batting at the hanging toys but doesnt care for the others.  If it played music with every jump he might be more entertained by this jumper but I doubt it.  I am still on the search for my favorite jumper and will likely buy something else for baby #2."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,"Baby loves these things, but so does the dog. Just means we need to order more I guess. The nipple will invert slightly as well so when you are trying to ween baby off of the soother you can do that, and then after a while cut the stuffed animal off the soother part. Baby isn't old enough for that for me yet, but I'm looking forward to see if that works!"
Baby,3.0,"Cute, easy to use, but dry wipes","I wanted to love this wipe case.  It's very cute and functional, but I have had some issues with wipes drying out when I get low on the amount in the case.  When there are many wipes, they seem to hold moisture  I am not sure if my case isn't sealing correctly, or if it is a normal issue, but having my wipes dry out isn't great."
Baby,3.0,"The initial Bluetooth setup was easy, but then it was not setting up properly ...","Just bought this after extensive baby monitor research.  The initial Bluetooth setup was easy, but then it was not setting up properly in the app on my iphone.  I emailed customer service (there is NO NUMBER ANYWHERE!) and they got back to me in less than 24 hours saying that it had a previous owner associated with it (since I bought it from amazon warehouse), they cleared it and it should work.....still did not.  I tried on my kindle fire, and it worked on that, but obviously I want it to work on 3G when I am not home. Anyway, still in the process of getting it setup on my phone, they have asked for a screen shot of the problem.<br />Otherwise, picture is clear (about a 2 second lag) and night vision is really clear even in almost pitch black.  We'll see if I can get it setup on my iphone....so far it's okay but nothing that great!! And very annoying not having a number to call...its all online."
Baby,2.0,"Too quiet, too small",Only one rattles.  The other is crinkly.  And you can barely hear the one that rattles.  I was disappointed that it was so quiet and my baby completely ignores it when it's on his wrist.  The straps are also really short and barely fit around my average sized 3 month old's wrist.  I personally did not find it worth the price.
Baby,5.0,My 6 month old grandson LOVES this jumper. So ...,My 6 month old grandson LOVES this jumper. So many things to get his attention but mostly he loves jumping.
Baby,5.0,Forget a blankie....,This has been our life-saver! Just ordered another one as our backup. Forget a blankie...all our little guy wants is Mr. Monkey;)
Baby,4.0,Wish the seat was easier to turn,Keeps baby busy and 3 different levels keeps it fun. 4 stars because he cannot turn himself in the seat. I hate that about this item. Everything else is great
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,vdry cute
Baby,5.0,Fits the City Select double set up great!,I have the City Select double set up and this is the best! Just had to adjust it to hang a bit lower so the handlebar doesn't get in the way. I love that its shape stays (open top) and that it fits a variety of cup sizes with a little consule area in the middle. Seems to be very durable and made well. Very happy with my purchase.
Baby,3.0,Not up to my standards,I purchased this for my grandson. The stitching came undone after the first use.  I sewed a new pacifier on and tightened up all the seams. It works ok now.  I would not purchase again.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves his jumpy!
Baby,5.0,assembly went very easy.,exactly what I was looking for. assembly went very easy.
Baby,5.0,The toys are great and he has figured out how to use them ...,My son is 5 months old and he is obsessed with this jumper. I can tell it has helped him with his balance. The toys are great and he has figured out how to use them quickly.
Baby,5.0,Priceless,"I am so glad we bought this! My two month old baby was unreasonably hyper - she hated to be lying down and was always wanting us to hold her upright - so we got this for her and she's loved it since day one. The little lights and music are fun and stimulating and she loves the colorful little jungle animals. When we first bought it she had zero hand-eye coordination; then within two weeks of playing in it she had figured out how to move the little monkey and even turn the elephant all the way around.<br /><br />She is four months old now and she uses it for hours every day. It gives her loads of exercise that we couldn't possibly give her ourselves, and it's portable enough for us to take it into any room that we are in so it allows her to feel like she is part of the action. I'm not exaggerating when i say that she loves it - she even cries if we try to take her out of it before she is done bouncing. It disassembles and reassembles super easily and the three different sides with the rotatable seat ensure that she never gets bored of one activity. It is hilarious to watch her going crazy and bouncing all over the place. The thing I love most about it is that it makes her smile, and that is priceless."
Baby,5.0,Lots of fun for Little Ones,Our daughter LOVES these Lamaze toys like this one.  She especially likes this dragon with the little mirror in the tail.  It's great to give her in her car seat to play with.
Baby,5.0,Great Stroller Organizer for Umbrella Stroller,I searched everywhere for a stroller organizer to go onto the handles of my Umbrella stroller - the Uppa Baby G Luxe stroller.  This is the perfect solution.  It can hold two water bottles plus an open space for additional storage.  It easily wipes clean and is simple to remove when folding up the stroller.
Baby,5.0,Great pacifier.,These are great pacifiers. If my son takes them out of the house at least one person is always commenting on how cute they are. My son uses the monkey as a comfort/lovie in addition to just sucking on the pacifier.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Granddaughter loves it.
Baby,5.0,Favorite activity,Our granddaughter absolutely loves it.
Baby,5.0,Un-be-fckin-leavable. Product of the century. Surely!,Un-be-fckin-leavable.<br />Product of the century. Surely!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loved this and it would entertain him for quite a while.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great grandson has had hours of entertainment in his &#34;jumperaroo.&#34;
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome translucent wipes case
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good product
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love this Jumperoo.  It works as advertised, arrived earlier than promised and in perfect condition."
Baby,3.0,It works great as a caddy,"It works great as a caddy, but I don't like the metal rim, because it requires removing the caddy from an umbrella stroller (which is the only type we have) before folding it.  Fortunately it's easy to slide it over the handles (since the velcro makes a loose loop), but it is still inconvenient."
Baby,5.0,... with the pacifier and the WubbaNub has been so great for our family,Our son was obsessed with the pacifier and the WubbaNub has been so great for our family.  Makes it easier to find the pacifier when he is in his car seat fussing when his pacifier falls out.  Would suggest for anyone that has a pacifier baby!
Baby,1.0,Not happy with the item considering the price,"Way smaller than I thought, and you can't change pacifers bc the one that came with it was sewn on! Not happy with the item considering the price, with included tax!"
Baby,5.0,It wasn't too bad to assemble,"I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. We assembled it Christmas Eve. It wasn't too bad to assemble. The baby loves it and it keeps her jumping and content for hours. She loves all the interactive sounds, lights and things she can grab."
Baby,5.0,This is an awesome entertaining baby gym,"This is an awesome entertaining baby gym.  My great grand daughter, 8 mos.old has so much fun in here jumperoo she has actually jumped herself to sleep.  I think that pretty much sums it up.  :)"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Fun!
Baby,1.0,The only thing that was great about this product was the sound machine that was ...,Stop working right after 6 months and the monitor totally stopped working after 14 months.<br />I was told it was a internal flaw and it would need to be replaced at my expense with a 25% discount.<br />Was never 100% reliable as far as monitoring goes.<br />The only thing that was great about this product was the sound machine that was built in.
Baby,1.0,Meh,"Only one of them is a rattle. The other one is in a noisy fabric. The wrist straps are nice, but the rattle is pretty disappointing."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The best gift ever!<br />El mejor regalo del mundo!
Baby,5.0,Great!,"Son loved this and it made life easy when he was old enough to be energetic, but not able to walk. This also gives you a bit of a break as it keeps a child very, very happy for a while. I have heard you shouldn't have a child in such a toy for longer than 20 minute intervals. Even with that, this is a great item."
Baby,5.0,Very good product.,Very good product.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect to turn the classic bottle in an efficient holder for you child.
Baby,2.0,It didn't stay in my newborns mouth any better then his other pacifiers,"Not what I expected,  you can't remove the pacifier to clean it. It didn't stay in my newborns mouth any better then his other pacifiers. Wouldn't recommend it......"
Baby,5.0,The boys love this toy,Our twins love this jumparoo. And it's nice as a parent to put them somewhere for a bit and keep them out of trouble.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"condition is as described, no complaints. thank you"
Baby,5.0,The Fisher Price Jumperoos are great. I bought one used for my grand kids ...,The Fisher Price Jumperoos are great. I bought one used for my grand kids and liked it so much I bought a new one for my newest grandaughter at her house. Very entertaining and when they kick their feet in excitement it bounces which excites them even more. Lots of little things for them to interact with.
Baby,5.0,Jumping even in his sleep!,"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! Our 7 month old received this as his one big present for Christmas! He was jumping for so long until he was face down with his eyes closed and was still bouncing like that!  Tons of giggles, noise making entertainment on each side. Best way to have him safe and secure, having fun, while Mommy and Daddy can actually get some housework done. Make sure you adjust the height appropriately.<br /><br />Very easy to assemble, folds up a bit so you can quickly move it from room to room.<br /><br />Only drawback is that the seat does not rotate as easily as another model we have at the grandparents' house."
Baby,1.0,"Unless your child sleeps with the lights on, you won't be able to see them.","We bought this video monitor to monitor our sleeping daughter; however, unless your child sleeps with the lights on, you won't be able to see them. We are now looking for a new monitor much to our dismay as this monitor was not inexpensive. I would not recommend this product to any friends or family members."
Baby,1.0,I read so many reviews and blog posts saying that this was the best baby monitor compatible with Android phones,"DOES NOT WORK WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY 4!!<br />Check website before purchasing, I read so many reviews and blog posts saying that this was the best baby monitor compatible with Android phones, however there are 2 phones and 2 tablets that they do not have the app software for. So if you have those devices then the monitor is useless. Had to return my awesome xmas present so I never got to actually try out the product."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"still using it, very helpful and sober"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excelente producto
Baby,5.0,The BEST investment yet!!,"Out baby girl (5 months today!!!) is over the moon with it so are we;-) its was  her Christmas present, but we opened it before the festive season begun))<br />It entertains/gets her tired.  Jampero  helped improving  her nap time regime  during the day.  Love it. Thank you."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Terrific !!
Baby,5.0,Keeps the little guy entertained,"Our little guy is only 5 months old, but he doesn't like sitting still, or sitting at all. This jumper allows him to see what's going on around him, while also building his leg strength and letting him 'stand up.' He loves the music, which we all have memorized now (but it's not overly annoying). Also, I was amazed that I was able to put this together in under an hour. We do have to limit his time in it, though, as he gets bouncing pretty intensely and doesn't quite know how to stop himself yet. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase and are tempted to buy a second one for the basement."
Baby,5.0,we could leave her in it for 15-20 minutes easily.,"We tried bouncers, swings & the 4moms mamaroo.  This was the only devise that kept my daughter entertained.  Granted she couldn't use this till she could support her own neck/head, we could leave her in it for 15-20 minutes easily."
Baby,1.0,"It works as advertised, but sounds like cheap video game","It works as advertised, but sounds like cheap video game"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,attached easily and holds everything i need when we use the stroller
Baby,5.0,Awesome product!!,My 3 month old son is 16 pounds and can hold his head up. He loves to look around and attempt at standing up. I purchased this product because other reviewers said it would last at least till a baby is 6 months old. I am happy that I purchased this Jumperoo early on! My son loves it!!! He loves watching the toys light up and he can even make it bounce!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Everything I was looking for!
Baby,5.0,I like that it is not TOO overwhelming,"My baby loves this gym, and it's half the price of a lot of other play gyms out there. I like that it is not TOO overwhelming. It has just a few toys, and makes only one sound, which I think is perfect, it does not overstimulate him."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My great grand son loves his bouncy chair and also has so much fun with the surrounding toys.
Baby,5.0,Favorite Jumperoo,I had this jumperoo with my seven year old and wanted the same one with my new baby. I was glad to see that it’s pretty much the exact same thing as it was back then and my daughter loves it. It’s easy for them to jump around and she loves reaching for the frog and parrot. My only wish is that it were a bit easier to fold and store. Even “folded” it is pretty bulky. The batteries seem to last forever and I don't believe we've had to change them once.
Baby,5.0,My 4 month old grandson really enjoy this jumperoo,"My 4 month old grandson really enjoy this jumperoo. It was easy to assemble, and supports his small little body well. I would recommend this product."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son would fall asleep in it all the time from jumping around!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My daughter loves it
Baby,5.0,Great addition for babies.,Purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it! She is five months old and will be able to enjoy it for quite a while.
Baby,5.0,Love these toys- have several!!,Love the Lamaze toys- I have bought several for my grand-daughter- I give them a shower gives and everyone loves them
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Too big and unwieldy.
Baby,5.0,Simple and perfect,"I bought a City Mini stroller and was looking for a nice console/organizer. Many of them seemed overpriced and/or flimsy. This little thing, however, is amazing. Simple and perfect. It fits my stroller without any problems, it has a zippered little pocket, 2 cup holders and a big pocket. I can place everything I need there: sippy cup, keys, phone, snacks, gloves, you name it. I am very happy with this organizer."
Baby,5.0,Fun for Baby!!,Baby loves it!!! So many things to look at and do. The sounds are great too.. So glad that it adjusts size as baby grows!<br />Definitely worth it. Keeps her entertained for long periods of time which is much needed!! Also a plus that it somewhat collapses for better storage. Very cute and well made.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loved it
Baby,4.0,This was fun! The only problem we had with this was ...,"This was fun! The only problem we had with this was that my baby could never really turn in it. The seat was very hard to turn, even for us. It wouldn't turn freely or smoothly."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Easy to put together. Many fun parts that keeps babies energized and entertained.
Baby,4.0,Fantastic!,"I use this on my Britax B-Nimble stroller. Love it.  I would have given it a perfect star rating except that it's kind of a bummer to have to take it off to fold up the stroller.  My work-a-round is to just undo 1 side and let it hang while I close the stroller.  It's a great size, totally functional and sturdy."
Baby,5.0,Great toy and great,Arrived very quickly. Our son absolutely loves it. Great toy and great price
Baby,5.0,Gave me great Joy.,I purchased this for my 6 month old grandson and he loves it. The quality seems to be what was advertised and they got it (live in England with APO address) in record time. It gave me great joy to see him hopping in the toy!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loves it. Not used as a babysitter but when he wants to jump.
Baby,5.0,Entertaining Gift,"We bought this as a gift for our 6 month nephew as it seemed to be a very popular product. Baby loves it even after three months, in his own mothers words &#34;he goes to town on it&#34;."
Baby,5.0,so glad to find this on amazon bc I couldn't find ...,"We had one years ago with our oldest child, so glad to find this on amazon bc I couldn't find it in the store. We love it and so do our babies!"
Baby,4.0,Great sturdy jumper.,This thing is surprisingly sturdy.  My baby jumps in this like she's at a rock concert and it's held up just fine.  I wish there were more buttons to press and more sounds.  The one song it plays over and over now haunts my dreams.
Baby,2.0,pacifier was fine though typical size and quality,"Way smaller/ cheaper looking then i imagined.  I had in mind a tradintional beanie baby size/ weight/ quality .  It's a very small, lightweight stuffed toy. Reminded me of something youd get out of a claw machine. pacifier was fine though typical size and quality."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great toy for the stroller and the car seat.  Came really quickly!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excelent!
Baby,5.0,Get it!,My 4month old granddaughter LOVES LOVES LOVES this jumper. We got her one for Christmas and ended up getting another for our house. Nice and springy. Fun activities. Totally worth it and the price is great in comparison to others like it.
Baby,5.0,Baby gives this five stars,One of my son's favorites. One of the attachments is a small mirror and he loves looking at himself.
Baby,5.0,Must have! Great shower gift!!,"The best baby shower gift I ever received.  I bought this as a replacement since we lost ours for a bit ( never hurts to have a backup).  This became our sons beloved toy and comfort pacifier at all times.  We have now weaned him off at a year and a half.  But, we will definitely be purchasing another type of WubbabNub for our new baby."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loved it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 month old granddaughter loves it!
Baby,1.0,"Neat idea, just didn't work.","The baby, when a newborn, never could keep this in his mouth."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,buenos!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loves this toy hanging from his car seat
Baby,5.0,We chose right,We love it!  We were choosing between Baby Einstein and Jumperoo.  Our daughter loves this one.  She loves jumping and playing with the leaves.
Baby,5.0,"Love, love","Love, love, love these pacifiers!  So cute, and the stuffed animal makes it easier for babies to hold these pacifiers.  They're also much easier to keep track of than the standard variety.  Just throw them in the washing machine to clean.  Wubbanubs are so popular in my house, they've become one of my go-to baby shower gifts.  Highly recommended."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect for b-agile. Sturdy! A great alternative from britax'z expensive stroller buddy.
Baby,5.0,Buy this product you want regret it.,"My baby girl loves this product. It was easy to assemble, real easy. I'm glad i brought this. You will be to."

Baby,5.0,nice,keeps them busy
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,As expected.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Easy to assemble, pay close attention to installing the seat, and my daughter loves it."
Baby,5.0,*** I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT - LOVED IT!!! ***,"This was GREAT!  My baby jumped and jumped and jumped in this before he was able to walk and do much of anything else.  There are also three, little activity areas and you can choose to face your baby towards a different station.  There are lights and music to encourage the jumping and playing.  You can set the length of the music/sounds or turn it off all together.  The exercise from jump, jump, jumping in this was invaluable.  The seat cover is also removable and washable.  This helped develop leg strength and &#34;jumperoo time&#34; was part of a daily routine."
Baby,2.0,"I just install my baby monitor, but when I ...","I just install my baby monitor,  but when I turn off the lights I can´t see anything... I noticed in a video that a red light goes on when it´s all dark, but in mine nothing happens... is the´re a special buttom or something that i need to do to activate the night vision? ﻿"

Baby,5.0,good for gift,cute toy. my daughter loved it until she was 1 year old. good for gift
Baby,5.0,great,Looked at several and went with reviews. My 4 month son loves it. Jumps so high we think he's going to break it. Only issue is the eelephant. He will occasionally get his hand caught between it and  the frame.
Baby,5.0,This is the best investment for my baby girl,This is the best investment for my baby girl!!!! At 1st she wouldn't last a hour but now she'll last at least a hour! She's 6 months old and absolutely loves this jumper.  She just won't stop jumping and it's the sweetest thing to watch! Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!
Baby,5.0,she jumps high like Michael Air Jordan,At first my little girl wasn't sure about it but now she loves her jumper she jumps up and down so high like Michael Air Jordan and she knows that when she jumps the music goes off we're going to have to raise it up to the second level my wife put it together within 15 minutes very well made and at a very good price
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,It's ok nothing special
Baby,5.0,Every child should have this.,"This jumper is awesome, better quality than many reviews indicated and it keeps my 6 month old granddaughter busy rather than sitting in a swing or other non-human babysitter. There are add-on items available to help stimulate intellectually as well as physically.  My daughter loves it, my granddaughter loves it and it's most definately worth the price."
Baby,5.0,"My son is in love with his ""monkey",My son is in love with his &#34;monkey.&#34;  This is great you can throw it in the wash with clothes and/or wash the pacifier with some dish soap/warm water. We are planning on getting another one to have on hand!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is awesome toy for the Infants or Toddlers.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Monkey is better than the elephant,"I bought the monkey and elephant for my 7 week old who could not seem to keep the pacifier in his mouth on his own. Before the wubbanub, I'd have to sit and hold the pacifier in for him. The wubbanub helps keep the pacifier in his mouth. When his head is turned to the side, I can prop the wubbanub in between my son and the side of his swing or bassinet. The monkey also lies flat on his chest and holds the pacifier in when he's looking straight up. Although my sons isn't quite old enough to grasp the monkey with his hands, I can kind of wrap my sons arms around the monkey to help him keep it in place.<br /><br />I found that the elephant is too floppy and doesn't work as well because the pacifier is attached to the elephant's trunk. The pacifier with the elephant doesn't stay in his mouth as well as the one with the monkey."
Baby,5.0,Excellent! My grandson loves the Jumperoo,Excellent!  My grandson loves the Jumperoo!
Baby,1.0,did not work as advertised and was really disappointed. also a feature to give access to nannys ...,did not work as advertised and was really disappointed.  also a feature to give access to nannys but then make it during certain times instead of just unilaterally would be a great additional feature
Baby,5.0,A Starbucks coffee mug doesn't rattle around & spill like in some other organizers,"Had this for 2 years now. It rocks. It's machine washable. It stays in place. It holds a standard size water bottle well.  A Starbucks coffee mug doesn't rattle around & spill like in some other organizers. The zipper pouch is perfect if you are folding down your stroller but want to keep certain items secure. It's simple, it's perfect, it's inexpensive. We use it daily on our Baby Jogger City Select."
Baby,5.0,Love it,Love it my little one is 3 months old but he's short so his feet barely reached the floor had to put a blanket under his feet. He loves it.
Baby,5.0,Love this! I've been trying to find something to ...,Love this! I've been trying to find something to use for my Bugaboo Bee and this is perfect! I hate how these high end strollers come with NOTHING. Perfect & affordable!

Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Son loves it
Baby,5.0,Great product.,"My little boy love's his George, that's what we call his WubbaNub Monkey! Great product... Helps with keeping the pacifier in and the most important thing, not losing it!"
Baby,5.0,We love it!!!!!!!,We love this jumperoo!!The best one out there!We tried several!
Baby,5.0,Best Binkie,"These things are great. No more bouncing binkies once the child spits it out. It's easy to find, easy to grab, and they seem to like how they look. And, when a baby is sleeping, the binky doesn't drop out and tumble into a crack in the crib when it comes out of their mouth. With these guys, they typically stay on their chest or at least right next to baby so that they are easy to find for self-soothing or for mom and/or dad to find in a deteriorating situation."
Baby,5.0,For the active infant,This was an great investment for my 5 month old! He LOVES to bounce and is discovering all the toys around! Keeps him occupied sometimes for up to an hour at a time! And it's very sturdy and well made!
Baby,3.0,it is of good quality but is too large for such a small ...,Purchased for a 3 month old; it is of good quality but is too large for such a small child.
Baby,5.0,Holy Toledo - this thing rocks!,"This is the best!!!!!  Seriously my daughter is nuts about it.  Pretty easy to snap together. A little bulky to move, but it's sturdy so I expect that. I wish it had a few more songs as I'm tired of the same old ones since my daughter wants to live in it!  5 stars for sure."
Baby,3.0,"My baby loves the gym,","My baby loves the gym, the trouble is that I did not get the full pieces were missing butterflies hanging"
Baby,4.0,Cute,"Cute, soft. Tags on the wristband of one of them are cumbersome."
Baby,2.0,"Too bulky, doesn't hold enough wipes for how big it is",It's bulky and I tend to run out of the wipes quickly in this. Takes up a lot of room in diaper bag. The button falls off when taking it out of diaper bag sometimes. You have to place it in bag with button up so other items in bag don't cause button to move in open position.
Baby,5.0,Best Jumper - Activity Center - Best Value!,"Awesome!!  My granddaughter, 5 months old, loves it! Everyday she discovers something new and wants to stay in it longer.  My daughter put a pad under it so her toes touch and she giggles when she makes herself bounce. It's also very practical for the small apartment they're in, since it folds to almost half its size. It helps her both her fine and large motor skills, as well as her cognitive ability. She'll be able to continue to play in it for many more months of enjoyment. THE best activity center, and best value, I could have purchased. My granddaughter's smile says it all."
Baby,4.0,It's perfect,Cute little monkey and it washes well. I've cleaned my grandsons many times. It's perfect
Baby,5.0,"Our son LOVES this thing! So, of course, we love it. Would recommend to anyone with a little one!",So glad I read the reviews on this before ordering it. Our 4 1/2 month old son LOVES this thing! It goes everywhere with us. I even attach it to his crib at night so it's there in the morning. He grabs it and bites on it and crinkles it and he just adores it. Giraffe won't be getting old anytime soon.
Baby,5.0,Best baby purchase so far,"We bought this for our then 4mo, now 5mo daughter and she LOVES it! Easy to assemble, she plays with the toys on it, and she will entertain herself for long periods of time. She was just a tiny bit too short (24.5inches) when we bought it, but we just put a book under her feet until she grew into it."
Baby,5.0,Baby Girl loves this.,"Baby Girl loves this.  Folds up, which is need for a apartment or small space."
Baby,4.0,One of baby's favorites,My daughter loves this jumperoo. She's 5.5 months old and not tall enough to reach the floor so we put a pillow beneath her. She loves the music and talking to her animal friends.
Baby,5.0,My newest grandson has already started using his hands and ...,"My newest grandson has already started using his hands and is already moving himself to get what he wants to grab, He is only 3 months."
Baby,5.0,Keeps our baby well occupied and entertained!,"Our daughter first started using the jumperoo when she was about 5 months old.  Being on the petite side, we were not sure whether she would be able to reach the ground yet but we put a pillow cushion underneath her feet and voila, off she went!  This jumperoo can keep her entertained for at least 20-30 minutes - she'll reach for the birds above or touch the various buttons and shakers around her.  When she's really excited, the baby will jump up and down repeatedly flapping her arms.  I highly recommend the jumperoo as it helps develop babies' sensory and motor functions.  The only con is that it can take up quite a bit of space and cannot be easily moved from one room to another after it is set up."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Just what was needed!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Everything OK
Baby,5.0,easy to setup,"he lovessssssssssss his jumperoo! easy to setup,and it grows with him"

Baby,3.0,They are cute and are great to play with but they were too big for ...,"They are cute and are great to play with but they were too big for our 5 month old, we will see if they fit in a month or so."
Baby,5.0,This is the best toy we own,"My almost five month old baby has been using this since he was two (he's a big baby), and loves it. He's in the second level,  about to switch to the third, and his legs have become very strong. He jumps everywhere and is already wanting to walk (without even crawling yet). This is the best toy we own. He can play there for long periods of time,  and it doesn't seem to get old for him. It's definitely well spent money. I highly recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Grandson loves it and so does his Mom
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves these and are great for him to chew on while teething.
Baby,4.0,fun colors and toys,"Pros: fun colors and toys, keeps our child's interest for extended periods of time, the base folds up to take up less floor space when not in use (this was the main selling feature for us), three height settings<br /><br />Cons: when it is in use, it does take up a lot of space in a small room, the seat is supposed to spin but we have found ours to be really stiff, and if you are looking for something with lots of lights and sounds, this is not the jumper for you."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great!
Baby,4.0,monkey wubbanub,These wubbanubs are the best pacifiers. My first grandchild and now my second grandbaby have used them. If only you could detach the stuffed animal for washing.  I would give it 5 stars.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"He loves it, our downstairs neighbors likely do not!"
Baby,5.0,Durable,"My son loves his jumper.  One of the plus is that the seat doesn't come out with him.  We have another jumper at my in-laws and every time we pick him up out of it, his thunder thighs brings the seat.  This one is great.  Easy to put together and keeps the little one entertained long enough for me to get some chores done.  Life saver!  My son is 24lbs and has no issues with weight.  Although I'm not sure what the limit is on it he seems fine and the jumper is handling him very well!"
Baby,5.0,My go-to gift for new parents,WubbaNubs are fantastic -- now my go-to gift for new parents.  You can tuck the body under a bib and have the head sticking out of the top so that babies can easily get to the paci part.  The shape of the dog and monkey versions are much better than the giraffe and elephant versions.
Baby,3.0,Stops working after a year,Worked pretty good for a year than randomly quit and wouldn't turn on anymore.
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,NOT WORTH THE PRICE
Baby,4.0,My 5 month old loves this jumperoo. I just ...,"My 5 month old loves this jumperoo. I just wish it was easier to spin, he can't do it himself I have to do it for him."
Baby,1.0,CONSTANT WIFI DISCONNECTS.,"Same problems as all the other negative reviews. I'm pretty technical savvy and got the unit to work. Problem is it keeps disconnecting all on its own for no reason. You have to also connect bluetooth and wifi at same time. Think about it…Do you really want to be the I.T. support center when your wife (significant other) keeps telling you the monitor disconnected or she can not connect to the monitor from her phone? Thinking this through, I returned the unit for a more reliable system. One that has dedicated frequencies that lock on to each other and stay that way during the night."
Baby,5.0,MUST HAVE!!!,"My son has loved this since the moment we put him in it at 5 months. He was so happy to have some freedom to sit up and control his body, rather than laying horizontal on his play gym. There are plenty of lights, sounds, and interactive animals to stimulate him...on a good day, we can get at least 45 minutes of jumping out of him, which is a great time for Mom to get things done!! Couldn't love this product more!"
Baby,5.0,Love This!,"My nephew love it and so do I, it's even more adorible in person!!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome Jumperoo!
Baby,4.0,Cute and colorful,"Very cute, my son has little interest in this toy,  it still look great to hang on the stroller though."
Baby,5.0,So glad I bought it,My little guy loves his rainforest jumperoo! He is 7 months and still jumping away and I can see us using this for quite a long time! So glad I bought it! Even my two year old gets in it and has a little fun. lol
Baby,2.0,grossly overpriced low quality webcam,"video slow to update and jerky, like a cheap pc webcam on a slow connection.  You get a better video with Skype or any other free service.  connection fails constantly and your iphone then gives a loud annoying clang every time.  I mean fails 20 times every hour and you have to try to reconnect.  Cannot access video from internet or pc, just get a &#34;not available&#34; message.  no customer support.  This is basically a very expensive basic quality webcam with a poor wifi connection.  It might possibly work better with an ethernet cable, have not tried that.  This company's strategy is to label a cheap webcam a &#34;baby monitor&#34; and sell for 4 times the price."
Baby,5.0,Highly Reccommended!,My son loves this! He wasn't holding a paci in his mouth well but these helped a ton!
Baby,5.0,My son loves this! Of all the toys in ...,"My son loves this! Of all the toys in his activity play mat, he always guns for this one!"
Baby,4.0,Loved the plate and the design,"Loved the plate and the design, but unfortunately it arrived with a big crack through it. It does however seem like a very sturdy product. Maybe mine was just mishandled in the shipping process."
Baby,1.0,does not work well with android,It is not compatible with android. The application and monitor will not connect (despite what it says)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Cute and well made.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Bought this as a gift and she loved it.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,I like it
Baby,2.0,Not worth it,One of them doesn't rattle. These were not what I thought they were.
Baby,5.0,"Excellent Product, Great price for Quality and everything.",This is the very best bbaby item I've purchased. My Grandson has spent endless hours bouncing and being entertained in this. We began putting him in here from the time he was about 3 months old. He's currently 6.5 months and we only had to adjust the height setting once and he isn't tiring of this at all!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Work great with the Natural also...
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Grandchild loves it
Baby,4.0,Wonderful but difficult to clean.,"My daughter loves this!! I would have giving a five star if it wasn't for the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the toy, I wish it was a clip that I could change out the pacifier. Other then that it is wonderful, my daughter loves holding it while sucking on her paci."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,This is too cute and perfect!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby loves her Jumperoo. The only con is there are not too many activities for the growing baby.
Baby,4.0,Good but ..,I bought this for my 7 months old daughter but she didn't like to sit in the jumper. She fond of the forest animals which are bright in color and easy to gain baby attention. My daughter likes more to be mobile and so she doesn't like to bounded in the jumper.<br /><br />Though its a very good purchase and i believe buying this by 5 months old baby would have gain more of jumper attention as they don't know more than rolling on floor and have fun of jumping.
Baby,5.0,Longevity into toddlerhood,"Wonderful longevity. The nightlight, movement of the leaves combined with the animals turning to the music always entertained our son. Once he outgrew the mobile itself, we removed it and continued with the music light box.  He would Activate it on his own. It was well used until we transformed into a toddler bed. The \\""nut\\"" worked very well and this fit on a wide bar crib side. It did not scratch the finish but for a tip, apply self stick felt to protect your crib finish on the nut and mobile assembly. The remote is to be desired. We hung it on his doorknob but discovered you have to be lined up with nothing between the mobile and remote for it to work. Eventually,  the remote just sat in a drawer."
Baby,5.0,Bounce away!,This was pretty easy and quick to assemble. My daughter loves bouncing in it!
Baby,3.0,My son loved this for a very brief time,"My son loved this for a very brief time; afterwards, he always wanted to be taken out of it after a few minutes. I think it becomes boring pretty quickly.  I think that a walker might have been a better choice."
Baby,5.0,must have in my opinion,Handy to have! Sometimes the Wubbanub is more of a nuisance and sometimes it's excellent! It just depends on the position of the baby when using it. I am definitely happy we have it.
Baby,5.0,Darling!,This is adorable and well made. It is cute for boys and girls.
Baby,5.0,Santa brought my 9 month ld son the jumperoo for ...,Santa brought my 9 month ld son the jumperoo for Christmas. He LOVES it!! He will stay in this longer than any other exersaucer or pack n play.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I love. Super recommend
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"I love it, my baby no that match, but is a great toy"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son sleeps with 2. 1 in his mouth and 1 in his hand.
Baby,5.0,Great jumper!,"Oh my, my son LOVED this so much from about 4-9 months.  Once he could crawl, he was no longer interested.  But, it was worth it's weight in gold for months!  He was easily entertained and just jumped around and laughed in this Jumperoo.  He loved pulling the bird and frog off of the stand, and played quite a bit with the toys around the entire Jumperoo.  Great product!"
Baby,5.0,This is a great product. I can bring my drink along as ...,This is a great product. I can bring my drink along as well as have a spot to put my wallet and/or keys on walks or trips to the store. The only thing is that it does move with the stroller so don't expect to carry an open drink (i.e. soda can or cup) without it spilling.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,baby loves this toy
Baby,5.0,GIVE THIS MAMA A BREAK!,"Started at 7 months, now at 10 great for quick breaks and to help relieve some steam ... He jumps and now watches some baby tv... While I see him from the kitchen. Awesome toy!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"This is Jumper is awesome!  Best of all, my daughter loves it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product! I sleep more thanks to this product.
Baby,5.0,Love the WubbaNub,"We love &#34;monkey&#34;.  We had the problem of our son spitting out his paci, so our pediatrician mentioned WubbaNub.  I have purchased 3 of these darling pacifiers in different animals.  We keep them strategically around the house (one in his crib, one in the car seat, one in his play area).  I love to see my son hug the animal and it provides him comfort.  I plan to detach the pacifier at some point and keep the little animals for him to play or cuddle with."
Baby,1.0,DO NOT BUY!!,"Horrible, just horrible.  At first, upon receipt in 2012 the product worked marvelously.  For about a month.  Then we had nothing but problems.  Customer service was horrible.  We finally stopped using.  Then I pulled it back out in 2014 upon the arrival of another baby.  Still didn't work, gave customer service another try.  Finally got it to work- hallelujah!  Then, within a month it completely stopped working again.  Although this time I couldn't even get the thing to turn on.  Again, contacted customer service.  Since I didn't buy &#34;from them&#34; but through Amazon, then I could not get refunded my money.  And conveniently it's out of the warranty period so there's nothing they can do.  If you're willing to spend $300 for 3 months of use then by all means get it.  But if you expect more out of a $300 purchase (like I do) then DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be sorely disappointed.  I, on the other hand, ADORE THE &#34;Baby Monitor 3G&#34; app.  It also has a camera, and uses devices you already have around your house, and NEVER fails.  The ONLY downside to the app is that it doesn't have an infa-red camera to see your child in the dark (I keep my kids rooms pitch black).  Other than that, AMAZING, and I think the app is $8 or something, what is that, like 5% of the cost?  I'm horrible at math, but really DO NOT BUY THE WITHINGS SMART BABY MONITOR, YOU WILL BE MAD YOU DID.  I know it looks brilliant, but it isn't long lived."
Baby,5.0,"My son still never took a paci - he just looked up at me like, ""where's the milk","These were very cute and well-made.  My son still never took a paci - he just looked up at me like, &#34;where's the milk, mom?&#34;  Overall though as a product these are adorable and well-made though."
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Returning it although it looks amazing my lo didn't like it :( prefers a walker
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves it
Baby,5.0,GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES HER JUMPEROO MORE THEN HER BABY EINSTEIN JUMPER!!,"So much fun for baby!!!  My granddaughter absolutely loves her Jumperoo!!!  Her eyes light up and she reaches for it the first thing  each morning when she comes over for daycare. She has the Baby Einstein jumper at home and my son says that she is much more entertained in the Jumperoo.  We purchased it when she was four months old and not quite big enough to touch the floor to bounce,  but she has always been excited by the toys, lights, and music. At five months old she has  grown and can now  reach the floor and gets a fun Jumperoo workout!!  She easily can spend 20-30 minutes in it and stay entertained.  It was much easier to put together then when I first thought it would be when I took it out of the box. Be sure to secure the seat to the hooks and there will be no problem with it coming loose, a problem that some others have stated that they have had. The best feature for me is the folding base that allows me to move and store it easily in another room when she is not at grandma's. I wasn't able to find it locally at any of the stores, so I ordered it online and  received it within the week. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic Jumper!,"My 6 month old son absolutely LOVES this jumper! I wish I purchased it a bit sooner (maybe around 4 or 5 months), but he'll be in it for another 6 or 7 pounds :) The assembly was super easy and it's really easy for him to bounce in."
Baby,5.0,THIS IS GREAT FOR MOMS AS BABY IS ALWAYS ON MY HIP ...,BABY ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS AND MANY PEOPLE ASK ME WHERE I BOUGHT IT.  THIS IS GREAT FOR MOMS AS BABY IS ALWAYS ON MY HIP & THIS TOY ALLOWS ME TO GET SOME STUFF DONE AROUND THE HOUSE.  PLUS BABY  ALSO LOVES TO PLAY IN IT.
Baby,4.0,Works great but the micro USB port design is fragile,"We have had a Withings Smart Baby Monitor for two and a half years. Unlike other reviewers we've had very few issues with connectivity over Wi-Fi or bluetooth nor have we had issues with stability. We've taken the baby monitor with us on every trip we've taken, both cross country and transatlantic. The camera quality for both day and night is great. We like that we can check the camera and listen to our little ones from either our phones or from our computers. One annoyance is that you have to use your phone to change the music/white noise.<br /><br />All that said, the baby monitor has one huge flaw and that is that the micro USB port is soldered right to the motherboard. It has nothing other than that solder to support it. Each and every time you plug it in it weakens it, until it will eventually break off. It broke off once in our first year of owning it. Withings replaced it free of charge and in pretty short order. A few days ago it broke off the replacement. I have put in a support request and I will update this review again based on their response."
Baby,5.0,Great for Exercise,"My son loves to jump around in this.  Some of the reviews complained about the lack of toys, but the main purpose is for the child to be able to jump!  Some of the other reviews complained about the cloth frog pad falling off, but I think they put it together wrong.  Be careful to put the pad inside the plastic frame and then wrap the cloth over and under the plastic seat, putting the cloth holes on the hooks.  This is similar to when you replace a garbage bag and wrap the top of the bag over the top of the garbage can.  I strongly recommend!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"love it, very durable and keeps the wipes fresh until my friend broke it :/"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Good quality, did the job they were supposed to."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fantastic!! Must have.
Baby,4.0,"great toy, keeps my son engaged","As some other reviewers have mentioned, the squeaker in the knight's head is a bit temperamental. It moves around quite a bit, so sometimes it squeaks great, and other times it barely squeaks at all.<br />Other than that small issue, this toy is great. My son (almost 6 months) absolutely loves it. The hooves crinkles, the tail rings clank, the horse rattles. He will hug the horse and maw on various parts of it with a huge grin on his face. The tail rings are great for teething. The colors are really bright and stimulating.<br />We have a few of the Lamaze brand toys and have been really impressed with each one so far, one temperamental squeaker aside."
Baby,4.0,This bouncer is good because it comes with 3 different adjustments,"This bouncer is good because it comes with 3 different adjustments, I wish it had more interesting toys to play with, 3 sides have the same type of toy-which you roll, we put pillow under my daughter feet so she can bounce, she's 4 months and almost touching the ground"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,grandson loves it
Baby,5.0,Love it,My grandson loves this jumpy seat!!!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My babies love this in their car seat!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My granddaughter can't get enough of this bouncer. It's keeps her busy while I cook and clean.
Baby,5.0,There's a great variety of activities and sounds,"My son loves this thing - he can spend a long period of time in here totally entertained. There's a great variety of activities and sounds, and my son just loves to jump and sit up and look around. So glad we have this in the house, I would consider this a must-have."
Baby,4.0,Quiet but gets the job done.,"The noises it makes are really pretty quiet and easily drowned out in a room with much ambient noise. Of course, one's baby is close enough to hear it just fine, so it works without adding to the general chaos. The teething bits are a nice size, but I wish were more varied in shape (like one more pointed, one longer, whatever) so it could soothe the back gums when teething and just for more interest. More variety in sounds would also be nice. Still, it's a great toy to bring to places where noisy toys are normally a terrible idea, like every waiting room ever -- not that it won't be noticed in quiet rooms, but it's possible to ignore.... and definitely beats a crying teething baby. :)"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is an awesome accessory. I purchased it for the Britax stroller. It fits perfectly!!
Baby,5.0,This giraffe is really cute!!!,This giraffe is really cute!  It is a very good toy!
Baby,5.0,He has really enjoyed all the features,"I purchased this for my Grandson, He has really enjoyed all the features. Would defiantly recommend."
Baby,1.0,defective,The pacifier was sliced up like someone took a sharp knife to it.
Baby,5.0,Great sensory/teething toy,This is my sons favorite toy while in the car seat/stroller. He's used it for 7 months now. I just throw it in the washer when it needs it.
Baby,5.0,Great jumper!,My little guy LOVES this! Vibrant colors without being abnoxious!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,G-Baby Loves it!
Baby,5.0,Great for our city classic double stroller,This is a great addition to our double city classic stroller. I can even trust having my coffee in it.  It's a lot sturdier than I realized which is great!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Met all my spectations. Recomended
Baby,5.0,It is so fun to watch her enjoy it,My 8 month old baby loves it so much. It is so fun to watch her enjoy it. I highly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,One of my favorites
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I love it !!!
Baby,5.0,Perfect for our preemie,"Perfect for our preemie! The little bit of weight of the monkey helped him keep the pacifier in when he couldn't do it on his own, and gave him something to cuddle as he drifted off...made transitioning him from breastfeeding to pacifier easy too as he had something to hold after he snuggled with mommy."
Baby,5.0,nice!,Product is nicely made. Well priced too.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great buy!!
Baby,5.0,Best gift ever!,This was the star Christmas gift. Wasn't sure if my 4-month old would be ready for this but boy was he! He absolutely LOVES this jumper and it has plenty of items that he explores as he jumps around. Best gift I've ever purchased for any of my 3 grand kids. Highly recommend
Baby,5.0,baby loves his new jumper!,"Baby Grandson loves this, and actually falls asleep in it, he just wears himself out jumping !"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for anyone looking for a 6month old gift,My daughter loves this! The music and lights keep her attention and she loves to bounce! Perfect for anyone looking for a 6month old gift!
Baby,5.0,Little Ollie Loves It.,My little Ollie loves this thing.  When his mom says buy something I do.  He is 5 months old today and got this for him and he is losing his mind according to his mom.  Anythng for my son.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My daughter loves ir
Baby,5.0,This Is The One You Want!,"This bouncer is amazing. Has provided lot of fun for our son. It's very easy to assemble and disassemble. Also very easy to adjust the heights. Makes sounds/music, great rattling toys and flashing lights. There are two volume setting which are nice and two music settings. One for constantly playing music and one for music only when the toys move. It's kind of big but it's not too bad. If you had to purchase only one baby entertainer this should be it! I would recommend this product."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,3.0,Not good for tandem strollers.,"We bought this to use with Joovy Caboose, and lets face it you are getting what you pay for. It will probably work better with other strollers but with the Caboose I would not recommend it. On the caboose it slides down the handle and makes it difficult for a child to get in and out of the rear side of the tandem stroller. There was one time I had a frozen lemonade in the cup holder and my son went to get off the back, he hit the bottom of the Diono with his head it tipped and the Lemonade spilled all over him and the ground. Just imagine if that was hot coffee. It does have one cup holder but the other side has enough room for a second cup if needed and it also has a zipper pocket on the inside which is nice. I think for something like a single umbrella stroller it might be a great buy but just not for the tandem ones."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great infant toys!
Baby,5.0,came just as advertised. My son loves his monkey ...,came just as advertised.  My son loves his monkey and his dog.  Wouldn't take any other type of pacifier.  He is always carrying it around by the monkey/tail.  Have had no problems with these for the past 11 months and he still loves them.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Does the job with my Maclaren Quest, and stroller DOES fold with it on."
Baby,5.0,Good,"It's great. My baby girl loves it so much even though she gets tired after so much jumping she usually goes right to sleep :) . we bought this when she was about 4 and a half months but it took her some time to get used to it, she's almost 6 months now and she's a pro at it!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect for my grandson,"Perfect for my grandson.  The nice thing about these is that they are easy for a little one to grab and find, especially when they wake at night."
Baby,5.0,A baby on the go must have!,"This is a must have baby item!!! We goto the park almost everyday and instead of fumbling in the stroller for wipes (when my son needs his hands washed) , these are attached to the handle for easy access.  Wish I would have bought this sooner."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"Great product, highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loved this jumparoo. It took a beating.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"His favorite place to play at, he loves it"
Baby,3.0,Just okay,"This is okay. It serves it's purpose for the most part. If you put a drink in them cup holder, it is sure to spill out all over your baby in the stroller or all over your feet. That's the problem. It's really flimsy."
Baby,5.0,Baby will love it.,Baby will love it. so colorful.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It is an awesome item! I will be ordering another one!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,They work for my purposes
Baby,4.0,Okay so I bought this for my LO who is ...,Okay so I bought this for my LO who is currently 2 months thinking that he'd be able to use it but I've decided to keep it till he's at least 4 months and try it. I haven't assembled it yet but will update as soon as I start to use it.
Baby,5.0,Top 5 must-have baby item!,"Of your baby takes a paci, you need a Wubbanub!  My baby cannot live without his Wubbanub monkey, Freddy.  So much so that we have 2 backups just incase one gets lost!  Really helpful at keeping paci in his mouth compared to the regular soothie.  Highly recommended!!"
Baby,5.0,Its easy to put on (just velcro straps) and holds phones,"This does the job. Its easy to put on (just velcro straps) and holds phones, drinks, keys, etc. I have an umbrella stroller (graco breeze) and this fits perfectly."

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,As Expected
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love them
Baby,5.0,Great purchase!,This was a great purchase.  Arrived on time and my grand daughter LOVES it!
Baby,5.0,this is a great camera that works all the time IF you spend some time on the technical end to set up properly,"the device itself is easy to set up if you follow the very well writing instructions, and download the app to your smart phone/tablet. we have the app on two tablets and two phones and most of the time will have the app running on two different apps with out any issues<br />at the beginning we started seeing some delays or freezing of image on the app. sometimes the app would launch and not show content and at that time i would have blamed the device for poor performance since i had read some reviews on the apple app store that users had updated the app and after it did not work properly, we did not have any issues with the app, however, after doing some troubleshooting i realized that my home wifi router had assigned a internal wifi IP address to the baby camera and after a week it would try to assign another IP since i have many wifi devices that don't always come on-line  and an older device had been assigned the internal wifi IP address previously and it had been off-line for a while<br />to solve this i assigned a static internal WIFI IP address to the baby camera and thereafter i never had any issues using the baby camera in the house and the sound is very clear and crisp, i can hear my baby toss and turn.<br />the alerts take some tweaking to set up, otherwise you will be alerted every time your baby moves an arm, however, we found that for us having the volume way up on the table is enough to hear him when he wakes up<br />Remote viewing, the app allows you to log in and watch / hear what's going on in five minute intervals, however, if found that if you are in a low signal cell phone area you will have a hard time logging in and getting the image on your phone, or in a public Wifi spot that is low speed (starbucks for example) due to a lot of ursers you will probably not get a good signal, this is most likely due to the high quality of video/audio you get<br />if you can get a good wifi signal with a high speed to view / listen to your little one while at work you should have no problemsork you should have no problems"
Baby,5.0,buy it,Granddaughter's favorite toy
Baby,5.0,I love this,"It made my bugaboo so much better!  I can have drinks, my phone, car keys all within easy reach."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves all of the different sights and sounds this jumperoo makes.
Baby,5.0,Great product!,"My daughter is 1 day shy of 5 months and we've been using this thing for a couple of weeks now. She absolutely loves it! It's perfect to just set her in for 15 or 20 minutes and get dinner ready/laundry folded, etc. I think we'll get months of fun out of it."
Baby,3.0,The way that it's positioned makes it a big difficult to put drinks comfortably. The drinks end up being a bit crooked ...,Decent price. I have it on my stroller but I hardly ever put items in it. The way that it's positioned makes it a big difficult to put drinks comfortably. The drinks end up being a bit crooked and I worry about it falling out.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loves this.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,love this bag. Definitely does its job well
Baby,4.0,"Good, Compact Stroller Organizer!","Nice compact stroller organizer. I used it with my Britax B-Agile and had no problems folding up the stroller with the stroller organizer still attached. Straps are easy enough to attach to the stroller handles and quick to remove if necessary. Knocking off 1 star because the drink compartments do not have their own base - it is a piece of cloth attached to the sides of the organizer with the top and bottom exposed. This means that if you have cold drinks in the stroller organizer, the condensation would essentially drip down onto whatever other things you have in the stroller organizer as well, getting everything wet."
Baby,4.0,Very good one. Quick shipping,Very good one . Quick shipping . 4 star
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Huge help for new mothers
Baby,5.0,Highly recommend.,My son LOVES this jumper. Highly recommend.
Baby,3.0,just ok,"You can hardly hear the &#34;rattle.&#34; I mainly purchased for the rattle, so my son would be encouraged to move arms and legs. Also, his ankles were too big, and he is only 3 months old. They fit his wrists ok,"

My husband and I do not keep him in there for long periods at a time, but when he is in the jumperoo he goes bananas! We like that the bottom legs could fold in- it makes it easier to transport to a different room."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Granddaughter loves it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Great toy, high quality as expected."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I son loves to jump. We use to daily.

Baby,5.0,My 5 month old loves this jumper. We originally ...,"My 5 month old loves this jumper. We originally had an exersaucer, but he didn't weigh enough to make it bounce. I have to put a pillow down so he can hit something with a flat foot and not just his tippy toes. He can spend about 20 minutes in it and he just enjoys it so much! Welll worth the investment."
Baby,5.0,How to Get Ten Minutes of Hands-Free to Make Dinner,"Jumperoo!  It's a great word to say, and also a great little place to put the little one while you make dinner.  Our 4 month old couldn't reach the floor with her feet at the lowest setting, but we put a pillow under her feet to help give her a boost until she's older.  She figured out how to make the toys play music and sounds faster than I did, so there you go.  I was convinced she would never figure it out, but no.  Grabs the wheel, rolls it, noise!<br /><br />Assembly was a little tricky on the seat part, getting it wrapped on properly, which will be something you need to redo if you ever need to wash it.  Otherwise, assembly went smoothly with nary a glance at the manual.<br /><br />Quality product, goes well with the rainforest floor gym!"
Baby,1.0,Don't bother.,"we've been using this monitor for about 8 months now.    The audio video quality is ok, however the android app is garbage and we've been plagued with problems.    Now the app does NOT work with android 5.0 at all, and when I contacted support they stated they may never support the newer android devices.    It disconnects constantly on our wifi (there's no reason for this, our wifi works with all our other devices / computers without a problem).  Monitoring via the website works acceptably.    Overall I would NOT recommend for the money.  Just get a decent baby monitor (avent philips audio only) and don't waste your money on this crap.    If the company was serious about supporting android users and attempting to resolve the connection issues it would probably be a 4 or 5 star... The major problems are disconnections and crappy support.    In order to make sure i'm presenting a fair view, Withings has responded reasonably promptly to my concerns.  But primarily it's been to say they likely won't fix the problem."
Baby,5.0,BEST PURCHASE WE HAVE MADE!,My 4 month old absolutely LOVES this!!! We have many toys for her and this one is our favorite! She can jump on her own vs not being able to scoot across the floor in the other toys yet. WE LOVE IT!!!!
Baby,5.0,It has been the best gift! She started using the jumper around 3 ...,"I was given this as a gift for my daughter. It has been the best gift! She started using the jumper around 3 months and at 7 months now, she still enjoys it! I love that I can put her in the jumper and have some time to clean the house or clean myself ;-) , knowing she is entertained and safe! Recently purchased this for my brother and his wife who are expecting and told them how much everyone will enjoy this!!!"
Baby,4.0,I returned it and got a new one that is fine.,A cute toy. The stitches on one of the legs missed attaching to the body and stuffing was exposed.  I returned it and got a new one that is fine.

Baby,5.0,Cute and stimulating while keeping them busy,"Super cute, very stimulating and entertaining for children.  Love the spinning seat, which allows them to choose what they want to play with while developing leg muscles."
Baby,5.0,I would not change it!!,"I've used this baby monitor for two years with minor issues... Its reliable, portable and easy to use. The functionality to access it remotely works great and my babe loves the wave sound."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very cute however I dont like how the binki doesn't detach like the store ones.
Baby,2.0,Probably is Counterfeit or Defective,"My 6 month old son does seem interested in this toy but, i can see loose threads where the teething toys are connected to the paws. Im pretty sure a little more rough play will send the toys flying off just like in the &#34;product malfunction&#34; pictures above. Save your money, seriously."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"baby loves it, bought it for a friend"
Baby,5.0,Quality is great as,Can't beat the price! Quality is great as well
Baby,5.0,Sanity saving product extraordinaire!,"Mr Monkey as we call him, has been one of the best investments that we've made since our daughter was born. We got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven't looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package. Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother. When she's fussy we just ask her to go adds find Mr Monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down.<br /><br />For those with concerns about keeping it clean, I just throw the whole thing in the washer (we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed). When it comes out of the dryer I just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it, a fresh clean wubbanub. ;-)"

I liked this one in particular because it has the black and while on the bottom of it which is great for little babies who's eyes are drawn to contrasting like the black and white.  Easily hooks onto carseat, stroller, carrier, ect.."
Baby,3.0,good pacifier,"Keeps pulling out of mouth from the stuffed animal, good pacifier though"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Has a bit of a funky smell in the hooves. But otherwise the baby loves it.
Baby,5.0,Love this!,"This has been an amazing jumper so far! At first our daughter could sit in it but had no interest in jumping! It still kept her insanely entertained. Once she started to jump she loved it that much more. It has been the best baby distraction while mom has to do dishes, get ready for work, etc. I highly recommend this jumper for anyone looking!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Easy to find when kids misplace and easy for baby to put back in mouth.
Baby,5.0,Lost without it!,My six month old son would be lost with out it. He loves it because the monkey r any of the stuff animals at the end make it possible for him to handle it himself.
Baby,5.0,"Loveable product, good customer service","We received this as a gift for young son. He liked it as soon as he could start grabbing things. He rarely uses a different pacifier. I original had some trouble with one of the seams ripping. I contacted the company and they overnighted me a brand new monkey, with heartfelt apologies for the defect. I am impressed by their customer service, and my son loves his monkey."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fantastic. My kid only jumps on this and laughs. Happy baby = happy parents.
Baby,3.0,Seat small!,"We bought this for our 4 month old because our first daughter, who is now 7, loved it! It is pretty good, however there is a noticeable difference in the size of the seat and the leg holes. It is really hard to get her in and out. She is only 4 months old and average size. I can't imagine she will fit in it as long as our other daughter did."
Baby,2.0,I have had it for about two years and it has weathered heavy use pretty well. My reason for giving just two stars ...,This product is just ok. I have had it for about two years and it has weathered heavy use pretty well. My reason for giving just two stars is that there are other similar products (by Britax or Baby Jogger) that are superior.

They seal the bottle and work well with any avent bottle: Classic, natural or glass.<br />It is helpful to be able to transport the milk and just bring the nipples instead of an extra whole bottle. Very convenient!"

I'm going with the Britax organizer which I ...,"This made it through the first kid, but now due to the wire at the top getting bent by opening and closing, it's deformed and much less useful. I'm going with the Britax organizer which I suspect will do better with repeated use on our Britax stroller."
Baby,5.0,Great Baby Monitor,"Installed two in our house and use them as baby monitors.  The added plus is that we can access them (video & sound) from iPads, Android tablets, iPhones, Android phones, and laptops.  They are connected via the internet with password protection and access is available globally (I've been able to view the baby monitor in Asia, Europe, and likewise in the USA)."
Baby,4.0,good choice,"Not difficult to put together and super fun, lots going on. our 4 month old was unsure at first, but is taking to it more and more every day. only negative is it looks as if it was made in China. i'd be sure to alcohol the parts."
Baby,5.0,"You can prop it against something so it stays in her mouth better, and she loves holding onto the stuffed animal ...","My daughter loves these! You can prop it against something so it stays in her mouth better, and she loves holding onto the stuffed animal part :)"
Baby,5.0,Surprisingly decent,"more than I expected it would be, the camera works well and has no issues that I have found.  I would love a POE model but will not discount this one not having it."
Baby,5.0,If your child has to have a pacifier ...,this one should work. It's cute. It's easy to find when set down. It's soft and washable. It's made from high quality material.

Baby,5.0,Perfect for G Lite by Uppababy,Fits uppababy g lite perfectly.  Stays on when stroller folds.

Baby,5.0,good quality.,"This product is really good. There is metal frame on top inside it, so it stays good. I liked and recommend it."
Baby,4.0,great for umbrella stroller.....,Not as sturdy as I orginally thought it would be but serves good purpose.
Baby,1.0,When the product worked it was great to be able to use your iphone to monitor ...,"When the product worked it was great to be able to use our iphone to monitor our baby.  Unfortunately, in the 1.5 years that we've had it, we've had connection problems, night vision issues, and now the charger doesn't connect properly so the device doesn't work at all.  We are outside of the one year warranty so Withings has offered to sell us a new one for 25% off.  I think not, considering there have always been issues and in looking at reviews online others have experienced the same thing.  Really lousy customer service and will not buy another Withings product.  They don't even offer a phone number on their website, only email contact."
Baby,5.0,My two month old loves this toy! She will ...,"My two month old loves this toy! She will stare at it for the longest time, and even smile at it!"
Baby,1.0,Disappointing I thought this monkey would help to hold the ...,Disappointing I thought this monkey would help to hold the pacifier in my babies mouth instead in makes it easier to fall out because the monkey weighs it down.
Baby,5.0,One of the best mobiles out there,"This mobile is very well built and it plays beautiful sounds. You can hear the noise of the mechanism working, but it's not unreasonably loud. My 4-month old loves it and I'm glad I purchased it."
Baby,5.0,Very bouncy and entertaining for baby and parents.,"My baby loves this and the racket he can make is hilarious. It is very bouncy. I read too much time in a jumperoo is bad for their development and can impede learning how to walk. He can't even crawl yet and when he stands, he stands flat foot, so I'm not worried about that."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I love it

Baby,5.0,My 1 year old grandson loved his first wubbanub and is now on his second,"My 1 year old grandson loved his first wubbanub and is now on his second, and loves it even more.  This is so worth getting in that it never gets lost and tiny hands can grab it and place it in their mouths so easily."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This little monkey is so awesome my granddaughter loves it so much I got her 2 of them
Baby,5.0,Much better than the Skip Hop version!,"Much better than the skip hop grab & go stroller organizer! I had this, but wanted to try SH, so I bought it.  It (SH) was awful, and returned it the next day. This one has a metal frame around the top that keeps it open so it is easy to put things in and take things out. The SH one is stretched out so the top is closed and you have to open it with one hand and put your drink (or whatever) in with the other hand (which is harder than it sounds). Holds two of any drink you want (even a Venti Starbucks). Bottom line: it's inexpensive, and does EXACTLY what it should do!"
Baby,1.0,For the love of your children DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GARBAGE,COMPLETE TRASH! After only a little over a year of use it won't turn on. The app has been updated since March of 2014 and doesn't work half the time. For the love of your children DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GARBAGE!
Baby,5.0,Makes my stroller complete!,"This was a great addition to my hand-me-down running stroller. The velcro is so strong, I can use it as a bag holder in a pinch. I was recently gifted a fancy-pants BOB stroller and this works just as well on the BOB. If you carry drinks in it, you must put them in the cup holder section because they will tip over quickly in the center due to the soft bottom."
Baby,5.0,Great gift for a monkey-themed baby shower,Part of a baby gift that was in response to invitations that was monkey-themed. A hit at the shower.  Score!
Baby,5.0,Our son loves this jumper,"We were lucky to have a friend gift this to us and she said her daughter loved it as a baby. Our son, who is now 7 months but has been using this bouncer since he was about 5 months old (he's had good head support since he was a newborn and rolled over/sat up early... so far he still hasn't crawled though!), also loves this bouncer. He gets so excited and talks to the toys and does all the different activities and he loves to jump in it too. He has a different one at his grandpa's house and I think he would love any kind of bouncer as he is very active and likes to move around a lot. But this one he definitely loves. It's great to put him in while I pump or send an email because it entertains him for quite awhile and he is so happy. We don't put him in it for a very long time because quite frankly I think it might over-stimulate him but he enjoys jumping and playing in it for a little while and then he seems to sleep better. ;) I'm glad he has this bouncer thanks to our friend and I would recommend it."
Baby,5.0,He loves it,Great
Baby,5.0,Glad I Found It...,Only thing my daughter will sit in for longer than 5 minutes without crying. Hates her swing..
Baby,3.0,"Serves purpose, but a few annoyances","I have a Chicco Capri Lightweight stroller (http://smile.amazon.com/Chicco-Capri-Lightweight-Stroller-Tangerine/dp/B000FFS9VM) that I use this with.  I like how it's easy to put my iPhone in there and also drinks. The sippy cup (http://smile.amazon.com/NUK-Learner-Silicone-Bundle-Patterns/dp/B00GEF7LMA/) I use has large handles so it doesn't quite fit in the cup holder section.  Pros: - suits purpose and hold cups, cell phones, keys, sunglasses - Velcro is strong, don't need to worry about it falling off handles - can be interchanged with multiple strollers, if you have multiples  Cons: - our sippy cup with handles doesn't fit in cup holder sections - when we collapse our stroller, we have to remove one end of the organizer which is just an annoyance when you're in a hurry (the Velco is strong) - The way our handles are, the organizer tilts in towards the stroller so it's not straight, not a biggie unless you want to put a non spill proof cup in there.  Update: The above stroller we gave to our day care provider to use with the cup holder. We got an older (manuf in 2004) lightweight stroller for ourselves and the organizer fits better on it, I don't need to remove one end when I collapse the stroller. For this stroller I do like the attachment for. Also, son now uses sippy cups without handles and it's works just fine."
Baby,4.0,This is one of the better items we have bought for our baby,"This is one of the better items we have bought for our baby. It is fairly narrow and I wish it was more bouncy than it is (like a Johnny Jump Up). Our son is entertained by the toys and he is kept busy for around 15-30 minutes at a time, which helps when Mama needs a little break or gives me some time to do something small around the house. I'd buy this again."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Very good, my little one loves it."
Baby,5.0,Loved them so much I give them as gifts.,"Love these. Rather than buying separate stuffed animals and pacifiers/nooks, this gives the baby something to hold onto, helps them find it when upset, and are generally just awesome. This particular one was for a gift and they love it."
Baby,5.0,and sturdy. My son going to love this,"Really cute, and sturdy. My son going to love this. Would recommend!"
Baby,5.0,I did a lot of research before buying this jumper!,"Our 6mo son absolutely loves this. He is very busy and was too tall for my comfort in a door frame jumper. The toys are appropriate for young babies- spinning toys, hanging, music. We had the space saver jumper but he outgrew the toys and needed more movement."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,Baby LOVES this!!! She jumps like crazy and tuckers herself out for nice naps. Well worth the money!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby love it.Baby love it.
Baby,2.0,NOT EYE APPEALING PACKAGING!,I bought it as a baby shower present and the product looked okay but the packaging was disappointing.  The plastic bag it was in looked to be about 5+ years old.  It made it look like I had bought it years ago and stuck it somewhere until I found a use for it.  Personally because of the packaging I am not sure that I would want a baby to use the pacifier.
Baby,5.0,"Its pretty large, pretty plastic","OMG my kid LOVES this. Its pretty large, pretty plastic, but its all worth it to see the pure joy on his face. I purchased this particular one as I had hear it was especially good for tall lean babies and it's true- totally perfect and there is even yet one more height level he can enjoy on it. Its very engaging, safe and entertaining."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,i´m satisfied with the product
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect. Simple to assemble. Wonderful to use. Simply pefect.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very useful
Baby,1.0,It looked terrible in the house,This thing was a monstrosity of plastic.  It looked terrible in the house.
Baby,4.0,Lots of features,"Overall, we really like this monitor. It has a great, clear picture, even in the dark. The audio is clear and the parent microphone works well also. And lots of other features, more really than seem necessary (to me anyway, husband loves it).<br />The notification settings for room temp/noise/motion seemed like they would be nice, but we found annoying after about a day. Perhaps we could have tweeked the thresholds to be more useful, but we just turned them off, problem solved. The temp notification seemed to go off even when it was reporting within our thresholds though. It just seemed like one of them was constantly chiming on our phones...even when no one was in the nursery and we didn't care.<br />There is a slight delay, sometimes a couple seconds, that you don't get with traditional monitors, but an unlimited range (you can check in from work if you felt so inclined). And it occasionally loses connection, which doesn't restart automatically if the app is not actually open at the time (if you are listening to the audio with the app closed); this is really an issue with the wifi router failing, but something to be aware of if that's what you are relying on.<br />The nightlight and lullaby/white noise features are really nice. The light is very dim; enough to give the baby some light but not so much that it would be distracting or keep them awake. The lullaby feature is great for helping baby sleep (our son goes right out with the ocean sounds); but keep in mind, you'll be listening to it loud and clear also. It's nice that both the light and lullaby have timers (3, 15, and 60 min) or can be turned on and off as needed, and the volume adjusted on the unit or from the app.<br />That said, for me, the only real drawback is that you have to use an app on your phone or tablet to listen/view; I prefer the traditional monitors with a dedicated parent unit. But my husband loves having it on his phone...he would control everything in the house that way if they all had apps, and most of them seem to. It makes it harder to multitask and monitor the baby; for instance if you are on the phone, you can't hear the monitor at the same time (anything that has audio will shut down the monitor's audio). It also drains my phone battery quicker if I leave the non-stop listening feature on. Since we really only put the baby in his room to sleep at night, these haven't been huge issues for me...I can leave my phone on the charger next to me and obviously I'm not using the phone for anything else while I'm sleeping.<br />All in all, we are very pleased with the purchase and the monitor has met our needs."

Baby,4.0,This product is great. Almost perfect,"This product is great. Almost perfect. My little guy has had his monkey wubbanub since the day he was born, he's now 2. I have three older children that I wish these would have been around for. We spent a lot of money replacing missing pacifiers for them. With that being said, I do wish there was a way to easily replace the soothie. I have had to hand stitch new ones on more than a few times now. Which brings me to the next problem, he has become attached to his monkey. He won't take the giraffe or frog that he has and we even bought a second monkey that he won't take. He loves his two year old, worn in monkey. So when I decide to take away his paci, I'll also be taking away his lovey at the same time. It's not something I'm looking forward to."
Baby,1.0,too big,Baby's feet didn't reach ground. Returned. Got an Exersaucer - so much happier
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son love it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,work great no leaking
Baby,4.0,Plays in it for hours!,"My son loves this jumper. We got it for him at Christmas, when he was 4 months old. He wasn't able to jump yet, but still enjoyed being upright and playing with the toys. At about 5 months, he figured out how to jump and just went nuts. He'll play in it so hard that he's actually fallen asleep in it a few times. My only complaint is that it's very hard to spin the seat. At 6 months, he's still unable to spin the seat by himself. He just turns his whole body to reach the toys behind him. My husband also found it a little challenging to get the cloth correctly positioned onto the seat when setting it up. It's also huge! I wouldn't recommend it if you have a small apartment or living room. We actually keep it in our foyer when kiddo isn't in it, so that it's not dominating our living room. If I could change one thing about it, I'd make it portable, somehow, so that we could take it with us to the grandparents, etc, since he loves it so much. As it is now, we'd have to pretty much disassemble it to take it anywhere."
Baby,5.0,Great buy!,Baby loves it and it offers more support than other models. Great buy!
Baby,5.0,LOVED IT,My daughter is loving her jumperoo just like her older brother enjoyed his. Great product and I do love that it has many toys and activities to keep baby entertained. My daughter loves to jump on her jumperoo :)

Baby,4.0,baby loves,Cute. But much smaller than I would have expected considering the price. Also not being able to change out the pacifier was kinda a bummer to discover.<br />With that said. My 3 month old seems to really enjoy it:)
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,it's too large for me.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This toy has entertained my daughter many times when she's in the stroller and baby seat.
Baby,5.0,Great developmental toy for babies!  Definitely recommend it to all parents!,This giraffe toy is great for babies!  Our 3-month old son loves to look at it and grab at the feet.  The black and white is great and catches his eyes all the time because of the contrasting colors.  He also likes to look at himself in the mirror and often grabs at the other two feet.  He also talks to the giraffe all the time! As he continues to develop I'm sure he will love it even more when he can pull on the feet with more strength.  I would definitely recommend this to all parents.
Baby,1.0,Not worth the money,Very cute but the toy doesn't help to keep in the mouth. Not worth the money. Too pricey
Baby,1.0,Not good.,Did not seem to work well for me. The wipes dry out quickly. The red thing fell off. Not using it at all.

Baby,5.0,This is a great product if,"This is a great product if, like us, your world is run from your iPhone. We really didn't want more screens and monitors, or more devices to carry around our home with us so we can keep an eye on the baby, this is perfect for our minimal lifestyle. The unit itself is pretty small, sleek and good looking. It's very simple to set up and get going on your phone. We can talk to the baby and change functionality from wherever we are very simply and easily. The resolution is great, even when the room is pitch black dark, and we love being able to take a quick snap shot when the baby is sleeping with his butt straight up in the air.<br /><br />There are tons of features, like temperature and humidity, which are great but not that big of a deal to us. Its really the look, phone functionality, the easy interface and quality that we appreciate most.<br /><br />We've been using the device for 9 months now and continue to enjoy it, and travel with it, but it did randomly stop turning on. When I contacted customer support, I had a very very quick reply, super helpful people and was issued a replacement promptly. Their website is very well designed and very easy to navigate, just as quick and simple to use as their product. Basically this is a great device, made by great people, with ease, convenience and style in mind. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
Baby,5.0,Great price and good buy.,"If you have Avent bottles, buy this to store milk. It seals the bottle pretty well and I don't need to buy storage bottles or disposable ones now.I am happy Avent bottles are versatile. Great price too!"
Baby,5.0,My son's first best friend,This is basically the best idea since diapers and onesies. My son loves his monkey so much he holds hands with him when he sleeps. We bought several so we have them in all his nap places.
Baby,5.0,Fantastic jumper!,"Love this jumper!  My son started using it around 4-5 months.  He loved all the little toys.  While he lost interest around 8-9 months when crawling/standing became his focus, this was so great during those intervening months.  I kept it in the kitchen, and I could cook/clean without a worry.  It also helped my son expend some energy when he couldn't do much else.  One of the top 5 toy purchases made during my son's first year."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My kid likes hugging the monkey.
Baby,5.0,I bought this jumper because it is made in the USA with the safety and happiness of my baby girl in mind,"Other people bought jumpers for my baby at the shower, but she was unsatisfied (and that made me upset).  I bought this jumper because it is made in the USA with the safety and happiness of my baby girl in mind.  We are both very happy with the quality, durability and the love WE have for this amazing product.  She is one jumping, happy little girl.  She really appreciates the musical accompaniments too (provided by Fisher Price!)."
Baby,5.0,Baby favorite,"Our baby loves this. She is still figuring out her hands so she doesn't touch anything yet but since she can hold her head we put her in there. The lights and music are great for her, and not too annoying for me. I'm sure as she gets stronger and can play with more she will spend even more time in there. Only drawback is even folded it has a pretty large footprint, but as new parents we have a lot of baby things so I'm getting used to it."

Baby,1.0,Don't bother.,This thing constantly opens and dries out the wipes.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for snack containers,Fit perfect and work great with the small and large bottles.  What a great way to recycle your bottles into snack containers.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Item was exactly how described and how i expected it to be.
Baby,5.0,Love this jumper,Cute and well built.
Baby,5.0,Baby favorite,"We hung this from our daughters playmat and she loves it. Having a small mirror on one of the legs is a great idea, the patterns are very interesting for her."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My granddaughter loves her rainforest Jumperoo.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves his wubbanub I'm going to order another one for back up
Baby,5.0,We have a happy bouncing baby,"We have a happy bouncing baby! I love that he can turn all the way around. He jumps really hard, yet it stays grounded and balanced."
Baby,5.0,Good toy,My grandson likes playing with this toy.  My daughter likes it because she can attach it to his car seat or to his stroller and he can't throw it on the ground.  Fast shipment.
Baby,4.0,Super cute and our baby really liked using this versus ...,"Super cute and our baby really liked using this versus tummy time without it.  My only problem is that the ladybug that spins is really difficult for baby to spin by themselves, so it gets frustrating quickly for them if they want to turn.  I like all the different textures and fun toys attached."
Baby,5.0,Excellent for storing milk,"These seal the AVENT bottles very well. You can shake up breast milk and there are no spills. I really like that the sealing caps snap into place. I have another brand that done, so I'm always afraid I'm going to lose the caps or spill the milk while trying to get it to seal properly. With these, I keep some lids with nipples and other ones with the sealing caps and don't worry about losing either."
Baby,1.0,Not worth it - Terrible customer service,"Not worth it.  The monitor worked for two weeks and stopped connecting to my devices.  Customer service is basically non-existing.  They do not provide a phone number, you can only email them (which they will not respond to)."
Baby,5.0,Very sturdy and lots of lights and sounds and play things to keep entertained.,"My friend's little girl loved this jumper that I bought her,  Well constructed sturdy and lots of lights and play things to keep entertained.  She jumped in this for hours. Now she is walking and running but the jumper is ready for the next baby.  My friend says it was the best thing for her daughter of all the gifts she received."
Baby,5.0,Genious!! will give one to every babyshower I attend!,"This was absolutely the best pacifier that I could have bought for my baby!!! He was a month old when I got this. These little precious monkey is my secret nanny! Keeps the binky propped on chest even after he spits it out, turns his head left and right, realizes he wants the big back...Boom! There it is! Mommy's hands busy cleaning his butt, glad I don't have to panic to put it back in my baby's mouth! Fyi: pacifier is permanently attach to monkey."
Baby,5.0,"FUN, FUN!",[[VIDEOID:ada8f3224bd5fdc2596c73362ecc788d]]My 4-month-old has a blast in it!
Baby,5.0,Great purchase,"We bought this for our 4 1/2 month old son. He liked the lights and the noises, but didn't quite get the jumping idea. Now, a month later, he is jumping and playing in it like crazy! He absolutely loves it! It's sturdy, easy to clean, and the best part: the little button on the bottom to fold it up. It makes it SO EASY to move it from room to room. I don't think any of the other jumpers available do that."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great Love it Thanks A  lot
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These are the best baby gifts to buy!
Baby,5.0,It is easy to find when you need it,My grandson loves it! It is easy to find when you need it.
Baby,5.0,"Yes, buy this one!","If I could give it 10 stars I would!!! My little man LOVES it! It is sturdy and the seat cover is easy to take off to wash.<br /><br />The lowest setting on this is the same height as the highest setting on some of the cheaper ones they sell at Walmart. So this will last longer, especially for tall babies. (If it's too tall for your little just put a book under their feet.)<br /><br />I do want to warn by saying the base is large so it has to be fanangled through normal doorways, but it's doable.<br /><br />TOTALLY worth this money!!! I'm able to get dinner prepped while my baby ricks out in this thing every evening."
Baby,1.0,"Don't bother, no longer a supported product","I was unable to set up this product using the instructions. The I baby support took 4 days to return my email. First they said they were too busy to help me, then responded that the m3 is over 4 years old, was their first try at a baby monitor and they basically don't provide support for it anymore, but would try and help me anyways. Their troubleshooting was no different then I had already attempted (reset to factory, reinstall app on iPhone etc.) sending this product back, and I won't dismiss bad reviews for this kind of product again."
Baby,5.0,pinch free and loved this toy,"Read a lot of reviews on this, we had no problem with our child pinching his finger.  He survived, pinch free and loved this toy."
Baby,4.0,Overall we really like this product,"Overall we really like this product, kept my daughter entertained from about 4 months until she was walking at 10 months. Then she refused to be contained. Now I have it in the closet waiting for my son to use in a few months. :)<br /><br />I do wish the poles were slightly sturdier, and that the lowest setting was lower (we had to put a pillow under her feet at first), but she still loved playing in this and I never felt it was unsafe."
Baby,1.0,Not worth the money. Support from Withings was not shy of saying known issue with advertised functionalities.,"I bought this expensive so called &#34;SMART&#34; baby monitor that can not only show you video of your baby over wifi and usual two way voice but also has humidity and temperature sensor. I anticipated this will help me keep the baby as comfortable as possible over night. Little that I know, first night of use and I realized that temperature and humidity monitor keeps on sending false push notifications randomly and not once or twice but throughout the night (all the time when baby monitor is on) and that keeps making noise.<br /><br />I thought there may be issue with my specific item's sensor circuits and so I reported issues to Withings support and they told me that its known issue with their app and that unfortunately they can not provide any timeline on when it will fixed (if it ever gets fixed). Usually app developers selling their apps on app stores in less then dollars are more responsive when bug is reported with their apps and so I couldn't believe the answer that I got from Withings support. Right now I am stuck with very expensive &#34;SMART&#34; baby monitor that doesn't work as advertised and in fact adds more hassle, hardship on us and baby with those constantly nagging false push notifications. I can always turn off temperature and humidity monitoring functionality and use it as &#34;DUMB&#34; baby monitor but I certainly did not pay so much where as I can get decent baby monitors that works on wifi and has two way audio at a fraction of price (foscam or even dropcam). Hope this review helps in your decision making for new parents out there."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Great place for bottles, keys, celll ect."
Baby,5.0,WubbaNubs Are Number One!,"We are HUGE WubbaNub fans at our house. We have had one since day one. This is our 4th in the collection. They have helped with surgery, hospital stays, and trips to the babysitter. WubbaNubs are my child's best friend."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Keeps her attention.
Baby,3.0,Not worth the $,Only one of them rattles the other has wings that make noise when you grab them but she is not able to do that yet.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,LOVES. IT.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your time or money on this monitor :(,"We really wanted to like this monitor and had such high hopes for it. It is a great concept, just poorly executed. It repeatedly disconnected and I would lose video and audio at random times. Withings sent us a replacement device which was also defective. It may have something to do with our wifi connection in the baby's room but regardless, there's no excuse for such a poor connection. It became worse with use of multiple devices, which is just unacceptable for us. Too bad.<br />On the plus side, Amazon is great and fully refunded our purchase even though we were outside the returns window :) 5 stars for Amazon."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"I love this!! You must buy it, you won't regret it My babygirl loves it."
Baby,5.0,5 stars,baby loves it
Baby,5.0,Love it.,My god I've never seen my 3 month old daughter kick so much. She def getting a workout in. Just another TOOL for your child to be distracted and safely/educationally stimulated. Love it.
Baby,5.0,Fabulous Gift,The parents LOVED the remote control.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby loves it!
Baby,2.0,"I Suggest You Shop Around. Cute, but Cheaply Made","I love the idea and the theme. My son always pulls the butterflies down because it's only a small piece of Velcro keeping them attached. Also, after a week or so, the tree & giraffe droop down because they are made from flimsy Styrofoam material. Another thing is that if you make the second connection to hold the sides together, you'll have to turn a piece to fit into the hole near the end. If you turn it, the baby will have to lay on top of it & it will poke him. So mine is only half-connected. Not worth the price."
Baby,5.0,This is a great jumper that I would highly recommend to others,"This is a great jumper that I would highly recommend to others. There are a lot wider variety of activities on it than other jumpers I have seen. Worth spending a little extra for this model, in my opinion. It is also reasonably easy to break down and transport, if you need to."
Baby,5.0,Would recommend if you notice your child is curious about everything,My son is 5 months old and he loves this toy! Would recommend if you notice your child is curious about everything!
Baby,5.0,5 stars because the quality is just in good in person as described,5 stars because the quality is just in good in person as described. In addition I paid half what I would at a department store!

Baby,5.0,Great toy for the price,"My 9month old loves this. Great toy for the price, nice quality"
Baby,5.0,So much fun... And lasts forever!,"We bought this jumperoo for our oldest son when he was a few months old.  It was by far his favorite toy.  The sounds and music are really fun, the colors are bright and there's all sorts of interesting tactile sensations.  It helped him develop his dexterity and strengthen his neck muscles safely, specially reaching up to the bird and frog above.  Some of our most fun photos of him are jumping in this thing.  Plus, it's height is adjustable in 3 levels, so it will held up well until he started to walk.<br /><br />Four years later, our 4-month old daughter is using it and also loving it!  It still looks brand new, the electronics work fine and the cloth seat is removable for washing.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase, I highly recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Perfect every parent should have one,Perfect every parent should have one
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,thanks
Baby,5.0,The absolute BEST baby purchase,"The absolute BEST baby purchase, hands down.<br />&#34;Monkey&#34; has been a best buddy, an anchor in the storm and a bedtime snuggler!"
Baby,5.0,Worth the money,Easy to put together. Nice and sturdy.<br />My 6 month old loves the jumperoo..
Baby,4.0,but it is pretty cute. It is fun for our 8-month-old to ...,I had seen other babies with these and wanted to get one for my son.  It was smaller than I anticipated...smaller & lighter than a beanie baby...but it is pretty cute.  It is fun for our 8-month-old to chew on in the carseat and suck on sometimes.
Baby,5.0,pricey but glad we spent it,My lo loves it at 2 months! Easy to assemble & really doesn't take up as much room as some play mats. I like the walls as we have animals & gives an easy rereminder to them that it's not for them.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,just too big and bulky
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,great

Baby,1.0,Disappointed,I expected something else but ended up with this. Disappointed
Baby,2.0,Cute idea but possibly a choking hazard for older baby.,"Cute idea but I was concerned that the 5 month old baby that I bought them for, would be able to pull them off her wrists, chew on them and choke. I sent them back."
Baby,5.0,Great product and fast shipping,Just as described! I'm very pleased with my purchase!
Baby,5.0,Durable!!!,I really like this product! Its very durable. Two thumbs up! Thank you seller!
Baby,5.0,Perfect match for City select,Fits well and doesn't interfere with sitting positions or car seat. Love the the little hidden zipper inside for keys and wallet
Baby,5.0,love!!,greatest thing to ever happen to my son'
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 2 month old absolutely loves this. He cuddles with it whether or not he's using the pacifier.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,baby has so much fun jumping in it! but they definitely outgrow fast
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,👍
Baby,5.0,LOVE this,"Love this!!  I wish I would have gotten it ages ago.  My Joovy Scooter double stroller doesn't have a parent junk holder so I've just made so.  I bought a detachable cup holder but that got bent very soon after I put it on just from folding it up.  I decided to chance this.  So glad I did!  Perfect spot for my coffee, phone, wallet and keys and a sippy cup or two.  Love it!  And I love the price tag even more!"
Baby,1.0,... the baby to be attracted nonetheless it made a great chew toy =),it doesnt rather enough for the baby to be attracted nonetheless it made a great chew toy =)
Baby,5.0,the music and little toys are great for him to touch and bite on since he ...,our 7 month old grandson loves this so much.  he leaps and turns and enjoys himself.. the music and little toys are great for him to touch and bite on since he is cutting teeth.  wonderful safe toy.  gives his mom a little break while he plays in a safe place. highly recommend this one
Baby,5.0,We like this case,We like this case. It holds a LOT of wipes and they stay moist. We do just open the lid more often than using the red dot dispenser.
Baby,5.0,This item is especially great for kids who are on the smaller/thinner side,This item is especially great for kids who are on the smaller/thinner side. The harness did a good job of keeping my baby safely snug in it.
Baby,5.0,I would buy this one hundred times over!,"AMAZING purchase!  My daughter loves it. It was a little tall for her at first but a sofa cushion under her feet did the trick! She is 6 months old now and can touch. She loves the toys, lights, music, and of course she loves to bounce. She usually stays in it for an hour or so at a time, which allows me to clean up the house or get ready for an outing, I couldn't imagine my life without this toy!"
Baby,4.0,For wheelchair,"Bought this to try to use with my son's wheelchair, so that he can carry things back and forth.  It fit under the bottom and he is very happy to be more independent at home and school. Great bargain for the price."
Baby,5.0,good,"Very cute, good quality"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Very well made, teething bites all over it without any rips."
Baby,5.0,Great for newborns,Our son loved this around 3 months. I would highly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,"Great value, great quality",This is a great product. The caddies that are sold by the actual stroller manufacturers are much more expensive for the same functionality. I have this on the City Select and it's been great for a quarter of the price.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,That's what I want!
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,Does the job perfectly on my City Mini! Just the right amount of space for the little things you need for a walk to the park or a trip to the mall.
Baby,5.0,Good,My baby loved this.. So easy for baby. And it arrived nicely.
Baby,5.0,Brown monkey pacifier,Great gift 😊 I purchased this item for newborn😊 6 months later this baby girl loves it and takes it with everywhere she goes 😊
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,pefrect
Baby,5.0,WubbaNub is the best!,"Since the day he was born my son has refused to suck on a pacifier unless it has a stuffed animal attached to it.  WubbaNub is the absolute best, and this monkey is very cute.  I highly recommend buying a few different nubs, because your child won't want anything else!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great toy for babies.  Lots of places for little fingers to grab & hold on to.
Baby,5.0,fast,so cute
Baby,4.0,Great toy for the money,Great toy for the money. Rated a 4 because it needs more toys and is really meant for a 5 month old height.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"My kids are very fond of playing this, every time they put into them so that they are very excited, this is really a good toy"
Baby,5.0,Good support,"Appreciated the prompt and thorough answers from the Withings support people; real time, complete and clear. Thank you"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Work great for providing a lid on the bottles for storing milk!! Love Avent!
Baby,5.0,gift baby likes it,gift baby likes it very cute
Baby,4.0,alright,"I had high hopes reading the many positive reviews. My little one was just 5 months old at the time and she had become board with her much beloved swing. When I brought the parcel home I was excited to put the jumperoo togther and see smiles and giggles. It was easy to put together, the quality seems good and it is very colourful with many different toys. But guess what happen? My little one cried when I put her in it, she just wanted nothing to with it. Fast forward a couple weeks later and now she likes it for about 15-20 minutes and then wants out. She likes it but doesn't love it the ways she loves her jolly jumper, or sitting on the floor with her toys all her around her."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Love this pacifier. I wish it was easier to wash though. The pacifier does not come out.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works great with my City Select stroller. Great Value...I'd definitely recommend this.
Baby,5.0,Such a fun guy! Makes all kinds of noise,"Such a fun guy!  Makes all kinds of noise, and has tactile differences that encourage using all the senses."
Baby,4.0,well built,"10 Month old hates this. However this was great when he was 4 months.  Loved to bounce, hoping he will like again, but it was a great purchase."
Baby,5.0,Hours of fun,"Both of my children loved this jumper. The music is a little annoying, but what toy isn't. I would highly recommend this to any new parent"
Baby,5.0,Grest value,"Works for my city mini double. It angles out a little but straightens out when a drink or other things are placed in there. the cup holders hold pop cans and bottles, tall tumblers and coffee cups. Great value for the price. Love the mesh zippered pocket as well."
Baby,5.0,Their favorite toy!,"We have an older version that our twin 3.5 mo boys love, had to order another one so each have one.  Great way to buy yourself sometime as they love it, seems to tire them out and good for neck strengthening I would imagine.  Life saver for twin parents:)"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product! I loved!

Baby,5.0,So much easier for them and you when they are ...,So much easier for them and you when they are still to young to hold on to things. My son loves both of his.
Baby,5.0,Rainforest Jumperoo is Great!,Baby Loves It!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"Nice toy, catches medium level of interest of my baby"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Perfect toy for a crib, play mat, stroller or car seat."
Baby,5.0,Fun for the kids,the kids love it - we had purchased another brand but took it back because it did not bounce very much
Baby,5.0,Love it!,"I love this thing! We use it sparingly (as per doc recommendations) but our little guy just loves it. Initially, he was all about the bounce & lights. After a bit, he started turning to appreciate the two back activity areas - the lizard and the sun. As he's gotten older, he really loves the details and higher level activities. He just figured out how to turn around the elephant and giggles wildly when it spins back around! Now he'll jump to pull at the tree frog & parrot above. It's neat to see him grow into the various phases of this toy ... and that reaffirms it's value since it isn't a cheap investment as far as short-lived baby toys go!<br /><br />We bought this for our little guy when he was just shy of 4 months - but in the 99th % for size. He fit into it great but needed a little help in the height department (we used a folded yoga mat under his legs for this purpose and to cushion his landing a bit). I wouldn't recommend early use of this toy (before 4 months) unless your child is on the larger size, has awesome head control, and can already assisted stand a bit. A LOT of movement is possible here and their still developing spine & muscles might not handle all the rigorous exercise well.<br /><br />The ONLY negative, and it's a small one, is the quality of the plush toys that hand - the parrot & frog. We have the FP musical rainforest mobile that coordinates with this model Jumperoo...it features the same animals. The plush animals on the mobile are a much higher quality. If I didn't have both, I'd never have known the difference. But, since I do have both, I'm left wondering why the cheaped out on this detail if they already had a similar item in production?!? The mobile ones really are much nicer. Not worth taking off a star, though. This thing is awesome!"
Baby,5.0,Awesome. My son loves it,Awesome . My son loves it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Just Perfect !!! He love's it

He hasn't figured the bouncing thing out but does like the toys that are there for him to play with.<br /><br />PRODUCT CLAIMS (my responses in caps)<br /><br />Jumperoo's comfortable rotating seat provides a safe place for baby to play (TRUE - SEAT ALLOWS BABIES TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF THINGS AT ONCE REMOVING CHANCE FOR OVER STIMULATION AND ALLOWS FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO CHANGE WHEN NEEDED. THE SEAT DOESN'T MOVE EASILY THOUGH, SO IT'S HARD FOR VERY LITTLE ONES TO ROTATE ON THEIR OWN.)<br /><br />Moving, spinning and jumping in a baby jumper enhances large motor skills (MY 4 MONTH OLD HASN'T CAUGHT ON TO THE JUMPING BECAUSE HE IS STILL A LITTLE TOO SHORT FOR THE HEIGHT OF THE CENTER)<br /><br />Baby jumper's colorful Rainforest toys and fun music stimulate your child's visual and auditory senses (THERE ISN'T AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF MUSICAL THINGS ON THIS CENTER WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE THAT WOULD OVERWHELM THE BABY, EACH TOY HAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SOUND IT MAKES GIVING DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES TO THE BABY)<br /><br />No doorway required with this baby jumper (SUPER LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO MOVE FROM ROOM TO ROOM)<br /><br />MY PROS:<br />Colorful and appealing for babies to look at<br />Seat supports babies who aren't sitting up on their own yet with a padded neck support<br />Leg openings aren't abrasive and don't leave marks on bare thighs<br />Easy to put together"

Shes 23&#34; and 13 lbs but she cant seem to be able to get her hands from the inside of the seat. An sure as she grows she will plan non stop. She seems very interested Already
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,We have a very active 3 month old and needed somewhere else to put him other then his activity gym. He loves his jumper! We had to start out with a few boks under his feet so he could reach the ground but now he is long enough and jumps his little heart out!
Baby,5.0,She loved everything about it,Major hit with our daughter! She loved everything about it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Amazing product for the price.
Baby,5.0,good $,works on britax and BOB strollers :)
Baby,5.0,One of the best baby purchases ever made,Our toddler still uses the music box without the mobile portion every night at bedtime. He is able to reach the buttons and change the music settings as desires - but has been mostly a Mozart fan since day one! I could not recommend this more highly. We have been using nightly for nearly two years and only changed batteries once. It is a perfect combination of moving parts with light and music. Sounds are calming. We never much used the remote. It has an automatic shut off after several minutes. Easy to assemble and adjusts to fit nearly any crib or bassinet.
Baby,4.0,Worked great on my Aprica fold flat stroller,"Worked great on my Aprica fold flat stroller.  I was able to keep it on when I folded it up too, but I had to make sure everything was out of it before folding (of course.)  It did somewhat tip a few times, but that could have been due to the tons of bags and everything else we had hanging under it on the stroller too.  Does the job, though..."

Baby,5.0,A must!!!,"My 5 month old loves this thing!!!!!!! Put her in at about 3 months so she can see the toys and she loved it, and once she was able to jump she couldn't get enough!!!! A must have for baby!"
Baby,5.0,Great,This is great on our BOB stroller. Great purchase.
Baby,5.0,Love it.,Love it.. The little bit of weight it has in the feet helps it to stay in my 2 month old's mouth.. I will be ordering another animal..
Baby,5.0,This is the best Jumperoo ever,This is the best Jumperoo ever !! My Grandson absolutely loves it.<br />Very easy to put together. Fast delivery thanks to Amazon Prime
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves it!!
Baby,5.0,Great,Baby enjoys it
Baby,5.0,Best toy ever!,Love this! My 4 month old loves this jumperoo. She is a little short so I have to put a thin pillow under her feet but other wise its great. I highly recommend this to every parent and their baby.
Baby,4.0,She'll appreciate it more in a month or two,"I bought this instead of a door swing because I thought it would be safer.  It arrived for my 3 month old (now 4 months) and she wasn't really fascinated by the Jumperoo. I love the bright primary color scheme,  as well as compact storage  capabilities and 2 volumes for music.  You can adjust the straps 2 times as you're baby grows.  The canopy seat part where baby sits in can be removed and machine washed.  It gets dirty quick since my babe drools a lot due to teething.  I also feed her in it and there's some spillage even with bibs and burp cloths.  The seat is 360 which is awesome once they're big enough to realize and move on their own.  I believe Ellie is still too young to appreciate all of these attributes. But it seems like it's growing on her rather quickly."
Baby,5.0,perfect for any baby wrist.. small or chubby :),I love that it isnt just one size.. you can adjust it to any wrist size...
Baby,5.0,Lots of fun for everyone!,"This is a lifesaver!<br />I wanted to get something my 3 month old baby girl could use without having to be able to sit up herself. This is perfect.<br />It was easy to put together, (although the cloth seat was a little fiddly), and it folds inward for easy storage, although I don't see us doing this very often.<br />It does need batteries which are not included and you will need a screwdriver to insert them.<br /><br />It took my baby a day to figure out how to bounce in it and she loves looking at the lights. We got a huge kick out of watching her discover everything and kick her little feet off the floor, now there is no stopping her.<br />I love that I can put her in it not long after a feed and it keeps her upright which helps a lot for acid reflux and spit up.<br /><br />She hasn't figured out how to spin in the seat yet, but she is getting there. It keeps her, and us, entertained for ages.<br />Worth every penny!"
Baby,5.0,We love it,Our son loves it. Jumperoo well made and has good quality of material. All toys are very bright and entertainment.
Baby,5.0,Great,My 4 month old baby loves it! Its great
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby LOVES it!
Baby,5.0,Best jumper for an active baby,I bought this for my friends baby and she loved the lights sounds and moving toys. The baby jumped in this everyday and it developed her strong core and legs. The baby is walking and running now but the sturdy jumper is ready for the next baby. Highly recommend!
Baby,5.0,buy it,Perfect for my urbini light stroller. I wanted a smaller stroller but missed the cup holders and storage of the big one. This is perfect. Seems very well made too!
Baby,5.0,Jump for joy! This is the one you want.,"This jumper was a bargain at the price. My nine month old grandson loves it! He spends his time getting very excited about being able to reach new heights and screaming with joy so that everyone can know. It has a stable base and even with his enthusiastic jumps never budges. The base folds in for a little extra space when needed. Worth every penny. Since babies will only be babies for a little while I highly recommend saving so,e money and buying this jumper rather than the more pricey (but lower rated) ones."
Baby,5.0,Love this thing,Love this thing! My newborn can't get enough of this and we take it everywhere with us. She can't hold the pacifier in on her own quite yet so the stuffed animal has grip and rests on her chest and shoulder to help keep it in when she naps or is in the car seat.
Baby,3.0,Fun but too small to last,"I was really excited for my 5mo old to play with these but they only fit his wrists, barely. His ankles are a bit too chubby.<br />They are fun until they go in the mouth and are covered in drool."
Baby,5.0,"Well built, do recommend","My son jumps like crazy in this thing. From when he started to now he has developed very muscular legs and has learned how to properly place his feet flat on the floor. Essentially, this allowed him to learn to stand and develop a lower body to support his weight upright. We choose this instead of a walker because of not having to worry about him knocking things over or tipping over and falling down. With this Jumperoo, I can keep him in the corner of my eye and worry less about the trouble he can get himself into."
Baby,5.0,Our baby loves these. The toy helps to keep ...,Our baby loves these.  The toy helps to keep the pacifier in his mouth.
Baby,5.0,Love,the baby loves it and is good quality
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect toy
Baby,2.0,"It's small and my baby saw it, threw it ...","It's small and my baby saw it, threw it on the ground, and never wanted to look at it again."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves it
Baby,1.0,Total waste of money,"We bought this product with a lot of great expectations like many out there. After 2 months of use we started having issues. First the power jack wouldn't fit, then batteries strated dying real, then we lost wireless connectivity, then it wouldn't even connect with the ethernet cable...after 4 months of fighting, it finally became trash. I would't recommend it to anybody out there especially to new moms who don't need any extra frustration in their lives tahn they already have!!!"
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it! And we get almost as much ...,"Baby loves it! And we get almost as much entertainment watching him jump around. As he got a little older (6 months vs 9 months), he became more interested in the toys surrounding him on the rim."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Great, handy item for keeping things at easy reach."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,bought it as a gift.
Baby,1.0,It smelled like mildew and had no tags on it,This product was sold as &#34;new&#34;. It smelled like mildew and had no tags on it. It was not new. You could tell it was not new. I wouldn't have let my dog play with it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great for it's price.  Baby loves the bright colors.
Baby,1.0,but I did not like it.,"Most of packs do not fit inside as it is too small. I tried to use a couple of times, but I did not like it."
Baby,4.0,Awesome!,"I love this, and I only knocked it down a star for one reason: The swivel isn't very smooth, so it's difficult for my five month old to swivel around to see the different toys.<br /><br />That said, everything else is PERFECT. He loves this thing. He laughs and jumps in it non stop and doesn't get bored! The bounce on this thing is great and doesn't take a lot of effort for him to really get a good jump in. And the toys are bright and fun. Also there's an off switch on the noisy toys. So when Mommy and/or Daddy get tired of hearing the music on loop, they can turn it off. My son doesn't really mind when i turn the sound off anyway, so long as he can JUMP.<br /><br />This thing is a life saver. My boy was getting tired of his play mat and swing. So when I need to do chores, I put him in his bouncer and he's plenty entertained."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Exelent...!!!
Baby,2.0,I love the pacifier but the packing that it came in ...,I love the pacifier but the packing that it came in is very unsanitary. I was buying this for a friend's baby as a gift and I'm almost embarrassed to give it to her because of the amount of dirt on the actual pacifier. Very dissappointed.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,excellent
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It is a very handy case.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,PERFECT FOR BABY SHOWER GIFT
Baby,5.0,Baby favorite,"Our baby girl loves this. As soon as she had good control of her head we started putting her in here. She wasn't a fan if swings or bouncy seats but this she likes. The music and the lights are enthralling (bonus that I don't find the music too annoying) and once her hand eye coordination improved the bug on a rope feature was a favorite as well.<br />My daughter is small, 22 inches, so even at the lowest setting her feet don't touch the ground, not sure how tall she will be for that but it is easy enough to put something under her feet. My least favorite thing about the jumperoo is the size. It has a pretty big footprint but I think that is just how these are, not unique to this one"
Baby,5.0,Very soft and entertaining for a six month old baby,My son loves this toy.  It's rattles.  It's makes noise.  It's soft.  Very soft.  Amazon is cheaper than the other brick and mortar stores.
Baby,5.0,best jumperoo,"My daughter at 3 months old loved this! It's the only way she would let me put her down. She wasn't quite tall enough then so I just put a pillow under her feet and she bounced like crazy. She loved the music and toys. I read a ton of reviews on bouncers and I'm glad I chose this one. The only negative thing would be that the seat would only spin around if I moved it for her, which was still a bit difficult. The seat cover is removable and washable which is great bc she would chew on the front of the seat."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome piece of equipment; very happy with this purchase
Baby,5.0,Great toy,"Excellent! This toy is soft, engaging, and colorful. Like all Lamaze 0-24 month toys, I highly recommend it. My daughter loves to play with it"
Baby,5.0,"Great price, solid catch-all",Bought this for a City Mini and it fits great.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,muy bueno
Baby,5.0,So fun for babies!,"Our baby has been playing in the Rainforest Jumperoo since she was 5 mos old and now is 8 mos old and still loves it.  As she has gotten older, she has learned to spin the elephant, grab the firefly, and touch the toucan herself and gets so excited when the song begins.  She bounces away happily for about maybe 10 - 25 or so minutes a day.  I also like that its very safe.  I can put her in it and go in the kitchen for a bit and know that she will be just fine."
Baby,5.0,When she spends her happy time in the jumperzoon everyday,"My 6 months old daughter jumps herself to sleep. When she spends her happy time in the jumperzoon everyday, the whole family are very happy too."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works well on our strollers.
Baby,5.0,"Lovely, soothing music","We have had this mobile for almost 6 years now. I got it for my daughter's birth. We used it constantly at night and during the day. The music is so soothing. I'm actually never getting rid of it because this music brings me back to those days when my children were tiny little babies, and I sat nursing in the middle of the night rubbing their little feet. 5 years after I took it out of storage, put in new batteries and it works just like day one. I did have an issue where the gears went out of place and the actual mobile didn't turn around. I think this happened because of the way the mobile was stored, sandwiched between a bunch of other baby stuff. But since I'm so handy, I opened the gear box, aligned everything back in place, turned it on and found out it works perfectly. Depending on where you are in the room the remote can get finicky but it still works just fine. My 10 month old son enjoys it just as much as sister did ☺️"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works great on our Baby Jogger City Select.  It is a better price than the name brand one.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for the nursery or for watching my older kids ...,Perfect for the nursery or for watching my older kids in the playroom.  Even set it up in their bedroom to make sure they didn't sneak down the stairs too early for Christmas.  Worth every penny I spent on it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome entertainment. Safe and can grow with baby.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Was not worth the money.  Didn't work well.
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,"My daughter likes it ok, but the Giraffe and palm tree always fall over"
Baby,5.0,Both of my children love their WubbaNubs,Both of my children love their WubbaNubs. The plush animal makes it easy for babies to find the pacifier at night saving mom from running into the nursery all night when they wake up. They last forever...even my toddler's tug-of-war couldn't rip the pacifier from the plush. Just throw it in the washing machine for easy cleaning!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My granddaughter loves it.
Baby,5.0,get it!,"Good price compared to other, does the job :)"
Baby,5.0,MUST HAVE !!,Our little one loves this from the day one!! it took her a bit to figure it out  but bright toys and lights was just Amazing to her)) This has been our saver oh so many times. 5 months later she is still loving it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves to jump
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter's favorite!
Baby,3.0,It is a good bouncer and good quality,"It is a good bouncer and good quality...but there's just not enough entertainment for babies to play and look at (in my opinion). Also, it doesn't have wheels at the bottom so it's really hard to move it around...I wish it did have wheels because then bigger babies can drag it around the room to help strengthen their leg muscles."
Baby,5.0,Beautiful. I bought this for my son before he ...,Beautiful.  I bought this for my son before he was born and started to get interested in it at about four months old. He is now 7 months and it's still his favorite toy. He loves chewing on DeeDees tail and wings. It washes really well in the washing machine. The only thing is I think people assume my son is a girl because of the pink color even when my baby is dressed in blue boy clothes.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Was very pleased with the product and the service I recieved!
Baby,5.0,It works well and my kid loves it so I'm happy.,"I got this for my infant daughter. She honestly loves this thing. When it comes on and starts spinning, she gets the biggest grin and starts talking to it (baby babble). It works well and my kid loves it so I'm happy."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves this jumperoo!
Baby,4.0,Easy and Convenient,"Love the ease this case has. It's a little bulky,  but I'd choose the sliding opening over the usual flip cases most wipe boxes are like."
Baby,5.0,Great entertainment for your little one,"My baby boy loves his jumperoo. Keeps him entertained so I can do laundry, house work, wash bottles, etc."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fast shipping product was new and my son loves his monkey!
Baby,5.0,Very happy with this jumper!,Purchased this for my daughter who is turning 4 months in a couple days. She demands independence and hates for people to hold her and not let her do her thing. This jumper completely satisfied her need to do what she wants to do! It was not too difficult to set up. Probably took about 15 minutes. I do have to place a pillow under her feet as she is still a little too short to touch the ground on the lowest setting. She instantly fell in love with the parrot and his big eyes lol. I searched and compared jumpers for hours before deciding on this one and I am VERY happy I did!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 5 month old love it.
Baby,5.0,love this thing,This thing is so awesome. When i fold my stroller it bends nicely without dropping anything out. It has zippers and seem very sturdy
Baby,5.0,This awesome great product moms u will love it,My baby loves it great
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My son loves it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,He liked it for a bit until he quit the paci on his own around 4 mo. old.
Baby,5.0,Awesome!,"Thank GOODNESS for this jumperoo!  My little boy loves it, and I love seeing him squeal and play with all the toys.  It will be a sad day when he is too big for it."
Baby,5.0,babys favorite,Great. nothing to be afraid of choking hazards. It has become my baby's favorite toy. Maybe they don't sell it in stores because this toy has it all. And it would be too much competition.
Baby,5.0,Great item.,"Bought this item for the Graco Breaze and loved it. Straps stay on strong and has lots of room for drinks, money, cell phone and I used it for diapers and wipes. A good buy."
Baby,4.0,This is our baby's favorite toy. He jumped in it from 2,"This is our baby's favorite toy.<br />He jumped in it from 2.5 months on every day.<br />First 2 times he looked around, then 3rd time he started jumping like there is no tomorrow.<br />At first we took him out after 25 minutes as he used to jump in our laps that long.<br />Then he would jump for 1 h 2 times a day, sometimes even 3 times.<br />As he grew older he started playing with toys more than jumping, but he still jumps for a while.<br /><br />Wish it wasn't plastic, but baby doesn't care.<br />Great that sound can be turned off : D"
Baby,5.0,My son could jump in this all day long! ...,My son could jump in this all day long! He loves it! It is so springy which allows him to jump high! He enjoys the toys as well!
Baby,5.0,Exactly as described,"Shipped & received just exactly as described, my son loves these!!"
Baby,3.0,NOT made in USA as it says,"I purchased the Monkey design, not because it was the cutest, but because it was one of the few Wubbanubs that said it was made in the U.S.  I received it and says right on the packaging it is made in China.  Disappointed."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Great for tummy time...learning by own movement, by hands...speeds up getting to crawling"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my 7 month  soon like it
Baby,5.0,Great buy. Don't waste your money anywhere else.,Awesome. Works great. We use it on the Joovy sit n stand and on the Baby Jogger City Select double.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Good product, fast delivery."
Baby,4.0,Jumps around like crazy,"Bought for 3 month old son, he seems to enjoy it so far. He is still a little short for it, but for now we just remidied that by putting a short book beneath his feet.  Update : son is now 5 months old and absolutely loves this thing , really has been a help to me and my wife."
Baby,1.0,Baby hated it,My baby hates this.  Never used it.  Total waste of money

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Loved it
Baby,5.0,Must have,My baby loves to bounce in this!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Babys best friend
Baby,3.0,Not worth the price.,Toys could be better. It's not worth the price.
Baby,5.0,NSA has nothing on this unit,"I gave this as a gift to my daughter upon the birth of my first grandchild.  I was visiting them recently, & they showed me how this works + all the amazing things it can do.  I fully admit to being practically illiterate when it comes to these kind of devices, but I was very impressed.  When my daughter was born, I don't think an audio monitor was even available.  This gives you a full picture w/audio on everything going on in the kid's room.  Probably for the best it wasn't available when my daughter was a baby - her mother would have spent all night just staring at the monitor.  Anyway, my daughter & son-in-law love it.  Unlike me they are very tech savvy, so if it wasn't high class they would have let me know."
Baby,5.0,It is nice because he is so entertained by all the toys ...,My son is 4 months old and was always trying to jump when we hold him in our laps so we got him this and he goes nuts in it. He would stay in it for hours if I let him.  It is nice because he is so entertained by all the toys even without the lights and music and he loves jumping in it. I asked his pediatrician if it is ok for his development because he doesn't jump with his feet flat on the floor and she said it's fine.
Baby,4.0,"Very cute and funny, color is warm and the kid like it ...","Very cute and funny , color is warm and the kid like it very much ."
Baby,5.0,Works perfect with my britax stroller,I should've bought this sooner. Works perfect with my britax stroller. No more holding drinks while pushing the stroller!
Baby,5.0,Bought this based on good reviews and sure enough,"Bought this based on good reviews and sure enough, it was a great buy. My little baby loves this, it keeps her very entertained and jumps up and down like crazy with a huge smile. And it doesnt get old either, she still loves to jump in this even after months of use.<br />The price is high but still worth it.<br />I highly recommend it"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,V good quality
Baby,5.0,Perfect for any,Absolutely adore these. Perfect for any baby
Baby,5.0,definitely worth the buy,"My 3 month old absolutely loves this toy! It rattles, crinkles, it's bright, easy to grab and hug and safe :-)"
Baby,4.0,Too small for 6 month old,My son loves jumping in this. However 4 stars for the fact it's not that big for my 6 month old and leaves a red mark in his inner thigh after jumping a short while.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"go to baby gift, everyone loves them!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,works great kid loves it
Baby,5.0,Buy this!,"Wow what value! Very high quality for $8, it's sturdy and as large as pictured. It has a strong wire around the top and bottom to hold its shape, 2 neoprene stretchable drink pockets, a zippered mesh pocket, and large open area. We walk and/or jog everyday, often to the store and back, and this holds my water bottle, key, wallet, phone, sunglasses, and baby's pacifier and sunglasses. I use it when jogging and have no issues with things falling out. I have a Baby Jogger City Mini GT (side note: we LOVE this stroller!) and this works well with the stroller handle. The straps are entirely Velcro and long enough to adjust to many widths of strollers, and you can also adjust the drop with the straps. This works with a stroller that has 2 handles, as well as one with a single wrap around handle, which mine does. The only complaint would be that the straps slip down the handle a bit, but that's just gravity :)"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,works just like its supposed to for our baby's bottles
Baby,4.0,Its a great buy,My eight month old loves this jumperoo! Its a great buy
Baby,5.0,Recommend,"Perfect, exactly what i needed, easy to attach to my citi miny stroller, fits 32 ounce water bottle<br />love:)"
Baby,5.0,Durable and Bright,"Vibrant and really brightens up babys crib area. Ive had this for 19 months so far and it still works, I even had batteries leak in it and once it was all cleaned out I thought it wouldn't work but it still works. Its very durable, even if older siblings pull on it and has held up perfectly. The remote is such a bonus to have especially if you share a room with your baby. The songs are soothing too."
Baby,1.0,I think they 'd be great for nursing mothers to take along,We didn't keep these as they aren't needed The cap does seal but to take formula with us we use dry powder and add water. I think they 'd be great for nursing mothers to take along.
Baby,3.0,The red closure tends to slide open when I slip ...,The red closure tends to slide open when I slip it into my diaper bag. It doesn't stay closed faithfully.

Baby,5.0,Bought this for my 4 month old grandson and he ...,Bought this for my 4 month old grandson and he loves it.  His feet don't quite reach the floor but we just put a pillow under his feet so he can bounce.
Baby,5.0,Great for little ones,"Great for little ones!  Makes it easy for them to grab themselves.  Also for newborns,  the weight of the stuffed animal helps keep it in place."
Baby,5.0,A must-have!,
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my son loved this!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,excellent product
Baby,4.0,Great only one issue,Great! Only draw back is the seat doesn't move easily. It does spun around but I she to move it for the child to play with the extra toys.
Baby,5.0,My baby loves jumping in this. The toys on the jumperoo are colourful and my baby enjoys all of the different toys.,Entertaining for the baby and everybody else
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,our grand daughter loves it
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My son loves this! He goes on this thing everyday!
Baby,5.0,Makes Baby Very Happy!!!,I and my grandson are very happy with this jumper.  It is full of things to play with and look at.  He is a happy little camper bouncing around in this.  I would absolutely say buy it.
Baby,5.0,Great Jumperoo,This has been a great purchase. Our 6 month old Granddaughter loves to jump in it and play with the toys. She also likes the music and flashing lights. Her Dad said whatever we paid for the jumperoo it was worth the money. We put a mat under it as they have hardwood floors. It is large and does not move easily nor will it go thru a regular door unless you fold it. That would be my only criticism.
Baby,5.0,I researched these devices before the purchase. The safety ...,I researched these devices before the purchase.  The safety rating and entertainment options were the deciding factors.  The jumper is meeting all expectations and my 6 month old Hrandson is loving it.
Baby,5.0,Quality and Versatility...Grows with your child=Awesome Value :),Love it...hard to find locally...so glad Amazon offers this very neat item :)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"These suckers are expensive, but worth it."
Baby,5.0,Great item and great price!,Simple and great!! Great price!!! Very well made.
Baby,5.0,Very happy with product and seller,"Showed up early, using as a replacement for kid. Very happy with product and seller."
Baby,4.0,Handy,"With these I was  able to turn my daughter's feeding bottles into storage containers and shakers for me to use. Can't fine the discs in the stores anymore, and I'm really glad I was able to get them here."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This console fits great on my Citi Mini stroller. Construction feels sturdy and price can't be beat.
Baby,5.0,My 6 month old thinks this thing is the best. The toys keep him entertained,"My 6 month old thinks this thing is the best. The toys keep him entertained, it's easy to clean. It's loud, but he likes that so I'll survive. The leaves pop off easily but there isn't anything that could harm baby on them and he likes to yank them down. The seat cover comes off so you can clean it, which is extremely important in my opinion. It's bulky and hard to move around so I made sure to set it up where I wanted it."
Baby,5.0,Hours of Entertainment,Showed up and had it together within 10 minutes - the baby loves this thing.
Baby,5.0,I am very happy with this product,"I am very happy with this product, my son loves it. There is something for him to play with all around and it keeps him engaged. The jumping motion has strengthened his legs."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good quality and compact size for my Maclaren XLR:) Above my expectation!
Baby,3.0,love the bright colors,"love the bright colors, but after a time the tree and the giraffe do kinda topple over, i keep trying to straighten them out but the support on the bottom does fade."
Baby,2.0,"Too few points of interaction, too hard to trigger noises, doesn't turn well","Good points:  the noises are not irritating, and my child loved the noises...  When she could get them to happen.  But the only noisemaker that worked was found at only a single point on a wide turning wheel.  The other two ways to get noises, from bouncing or from twisting the elephant, might as well have not existed:  the amount of strength required to twist the elephant is more than I think any baby will have, and even if she was bouncing around like crazy the motion sensor almost never noticed.<br /><br />And there are only three activity stations:  only one that has anything fun, with the turning wheel that makes lights and noises go off.  The turning globe full of beads is ok, but gets old quick. The button that makes a tiger come up is similarly built for Hercules, and never happened for my child; and the sun above it is also fairly pointless.<br /><br />Also note:  the ability for the baby to turn to new points of interest is very small, since the friction of the rotation is huge.  And it's too tall: my 45% percentile-height child has to stand on a couch cushion at the lowest setting.  And setting it on the highest setting is a huge pain.  And breaking it down to store it in its box in the shed required ridiculous amounts of force to pry the activity stations free.<br /><br />This is a ton of space wasted for one point of interaction.  I did well to replace it with a fake phone that has lights and noises in a package smaller than a shoe.<br /><br />Don't buy this.  Find an older stand-up activity center on Craigslist.  Back in the day, they had 12 toys around the ring, and the chairs rotated smoothly.  Exersaucer for the win!"
Baby,3.0,"The green and colors are nice, as my 2 month old son seems to ...","The toys are plush and the mobile plasticy. The green and colors are nice, as my 2 month old son seems to follow the objects. Also the two level sound is loud enough for the baby to sleep through."
Baby,5.0,"Awesome, good quality, universal","I attached this to my son's Urbini Omni because it did not come with cupholders.  This had two cupholders and a center area good for phone, keys, etc."
Baby,5.0,Perfect for our daughter!,We purchased this for our 4 month old daughter and she was so excited about it from the moment she first tried it! Jumping and smiling and enthralled with the lights and music. She is 24.5 inches high as of now and her feet just touch the ground on the lowest setting but she is able to push on her toes. We keep her in only for short periods of time but she is thrilled from start to end.  We are very happy with this product.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,"Was what I was looking for, as it was a baby gift."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Bought it for my nephew who is in the bouncing age group!  Loves it!
Baby,5.0,cute,Love it and so does my Lil man everyone thinks he is cute
Baby,5.0,WubbaNub,A good pacifier for my grandson.  He loves it
Baby,5.0,I love it,I had this for my first son had to have for my second. He's 41/2 months and slowly taking interest in it.
Baby,5.0,No-Brainer!,"I love these WubbaNubs!!!. Hard to loose and easy to clean! You don't have to put your fingers/hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up. Let the little monkey's body handle that part. They are nice and soft as pacifiers, but also great for teething; and not to mention a little &#34;buddy&#34; that has been there right from the very beginning of life. We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !  My biggest problem is which one do you choose??!  So precious!  Highly recommend this product!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I have owned one for every kid best developmental tool for little ones!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product got here fast
Baby,4.0,My baby loves it.  Another nice Lamaze toy for babies.,"My baby loves this toy.  It is cute, sturdy, easy to clean and she loves it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that one of the wings came to us folded and it refuses to unfold.  My baby doesn't care, but this is the kind of thing that bugs me.  This is a really minor problem though.  I do not regret this purchase at all."
Baby,5.0,We absolute love our Wubbanubs,"We absolute love our Wubbanubs! This Monkey is so so so very cute, and my son absolutely loves it. They are well built, soft, and really do make it easier for baby to keep the pacifier in place, as well as put it back if they drop it. Not to mention making it easier for Mom and Dad to find the pacifier since it doesn't bounce and roll when dropped."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,Love this. Hold drinks and cell phones and other stuff.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,great
Baby,5.0,The price is great and it is a versatile toy,"Our 5 month old loves this.  The price is great and it is a versatile toy.  It it pretty large so it can be attached to her carseat where it hangs down pretty far.  We also attach it to her activity center and stroller sometimes.  She likes to pull on it and mount it.  Of course, it can also just be held in her hands.  I would definitely recommend as the price is right and she gets use out of it."
Baby,5.0,adorable,Incredibly cute. And we no longer lose my grandsons binky.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Really entertaining, live the swivel feature."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Sons favorite toy. I've had it over 2 months now and its still a hit with him
Baby,5.0,i never thought my baby would love it that much,"i never thought my baby would love it that much, but after a few tries, she doesn't even want to leave her jumperoo! she goes in there and she jumps and giggles! she also enjoys all the things on there and especially love the yellow monkey (no idea why) but that's the one she loves to pull and chew on..."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,The product is good! but my son doesn't like it very much...
Baby,5.0,The review where the baby is bouncing like crazy sold us on this item,Exactly what we expected. Our granddaughter loves it.. The review where the baby is bouncing like crazy sold us on this item. Love it.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My granddaughter wasn't sure about this but she loves it now
Baby,5.0,More fun than pulling out the batteries of your flat screen remote control!,"Everybody loves a giraffe, am I right? My adorable little 18 month old grandson, who has saturated this toy with all kinds of food, milk and teething drool, just loves it and it's his favorite go-to toy when he's done trying to disassemble the entertainment cabinet or pull out the batteries of the remote control. If he loves it, it's okay in my book. If I could give it a thousand stars I would, but Amazon only gave me five to work with."
Baby,5.0,But now she can jump really high and so happy. I love it and the service is great ...,My six month old girl loves it! At first she did not know what to do only standing there. But now she can jump really high and so happy. I love it and the service is great too. Strongly recommend it.
Baby,5.0,Love this toy!!,"This is the best toy EVER, my grandson absolutely loves it!!!"
Baby,4.0,fun for a little while.,"It was great when our baby was under 2 months, then it wasn't much interest to her."
Baby,5.0,Amazing,"My son LOVES this bouncer. I was stuck between purchasing this bouncer or the little Einstein, but I decided to go with this one instead. He began to use this at four months, at first he would just stay put and sorta bounce a bit. He's now 5 months and won't stop bouncing!!"
Baby,5.0,My little one loved this the seat rotates and there is lights and ...,My little one loved this the seat rotates and there is lights and music perfect for curious little ones and the bouncing is a plus .
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,We bought it for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She absolutely LOVES it!!!

Baby,5.0,She likes it;),"My little girl loves it so far, it seems to be well madel I love the fact you can use it several ways,"
Baby,4.0,baby loves it; back support pole seems wobbly,"My son loves this thing.  In slightly concerned, however, with the back susuppt pole.  Its slightly bent and very wobbly when my son is jumping in the jumperoo. Makes me nervous as it looks unsturdy."
Baby,5.0,great product,"Fits perfect in my stroller, and it's very durable."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Easy to assemble and fold up when not in use. It is very stable unlike some others on the market. I love the adjustable heights so it can grow with my little man. He absolutely loves it!
Baby,5.0,My great grandaughter loves this jumperoo,This is must if you have babies. My great grandaughter loves this jumperoo. She spends lots of time in the unit.
Baby,1.0,I don't mean bad customer service,"Beware...Withings has no customer service.  I don't mean bad customer service, I literally mean NO customer service.  Go ahead google it.  Try and find a number to call.  Submit an issue via email amd they will confirm they received it, but respond with a resolution? Nope.  It's a black hole.  The product may work, but mine had a message to contact customer service as part of setup, and since there is NO customer service, I'll never know.  Returning it and picking another option."
Baby,5.0,Best jumper!,Both my babies loved this jumper! Best jumper by far in my opinion!
Baby,3.0,Very Nice but does not fit the crib.,"This is a very nice product but we are very sad that the hollow part which you use to attach to the crib does not fit any of the sides of our crib. We are not yet sure what to do about it but since we really like it, we might look for ways to hold it up and still make it work."
Baby,5.0,Great as every Lego product,My 9 years old son loves it. Nice Wolverine minifigure.
Baby,5.0,Great value,Excellent for price!! Came quickly and holds more than what it looks like. There is a small zippered pocket that could hold money or credit cards and then two &#34;pockets&#34; for water bottle(kiddie size) or phone.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great baby loves it!
Baby,1.0,Disappointing,Stopped working after about 2 weeks. It looks pretty but that's about it. This is the second mobile I have purchased from Fisher-Price and both of them broke in less than a month.
Baby,1.0,A bit small for my two month old twins. ...,A bit small for my two month old twins. Doesn't fit around wrist well. They don't make much noise when played with either. Doesn't grab my twins attention.
Baby,5.0,LOVE IT!,My daughter loves these. She has 3 total and they go with her everywhere. Since the stuffed animal is attached it's really easy for her to find it in the middle of the night if it falls out. The pacifier is sewn on real tight so no need to worry that it'll come off.
Baby,5.0,best babies toy!,My daughter loves this! It is a great toy!
Baby,5.0,Friends have another model but he can't jump on it like the one he we has,Our son just loves this product.  Friends have another model but he can't jump on it like the one he we has.

Baby,5.0,recomend this product!,my LO love them!!! totally would by another one to have one clean to switch.
Baby,5.0,good bottle sealer.,"it closes the avent bottle. i am an avent user because all of their items are interchangeable. this isn't a mandatory item. if you have the nipple and lid the bottle will be sealed as well. to use this item, you will take off the nipple and put the disk into the nipple ring to seal off the hole."
Baby,5.0,Great cup holder/organizer,"Great little organizer, and so much cheaper than the Baby Jogger one! Fits perfectly on our City Mini GT."
Baby,5.0,GREAT,Fits on my Bob and works as expected!
Baby,5.0,"Son loves his ""wubby""","My son loves his &#34;wubby&#34; .... He doesn't suck on the paci part of it though, he sucks on the monkeys hands, feet, ears and tail. Lol! UPDATE:  Our Boston Terrier loved this Wubby too and managed to sneak it away from our son and tore it to shreds.  We repurchased."
Baby,5.0,Fits my babyjogger vue,Works great on my babyjogger vue. Has lots of space and holds the item securely. Also the price is amazing for the quality of the product.

Baby,3.0,... coming loose on the back of the giraffe but great toy for the car seat,There were a few stitches coming loose on the back of the giraffe but great toy for the car seat. My daughter loves it.
Baby,4.0,I wish it had a little more weight to it but overall it's a great pacifier.,"My daughter loves this pacifier.  I had to buy a couple of them because when you wash it, it takes a little while to dry. The stuffed animal helps keep the pacifier in her mouth when she's sleeping.  I wish it had a little more weight to it but overall it's a great pacifier."
Baby,5.0,My son is 4 months and finally started getting the ...,My son is 4 months and finally started getting the hang of it. He loves bouncing side to side. It's a little bulky but it's worth it especially when you need a bit of time to yourself.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my bb like it
Baby,5.0,They both love it.,"I bought this for my daughter actually. She just had her first child. This gives her a chance to put baby in crib, turn on and get ready for work. Baby is content, contained and occupied. Cooing and doing what babies do learning motion and colors. They both love it."
Baby,3.0,it is a fun jumper with attractive toys on it,"Overall, it is a fun jumper with attractive toys on it. However, the material use for the seat is too hard and scratched my daughters legs when she played in it for more than 10 mins."
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,It's okay - a lot smaller than I expected.
Baby,5.0,Best toy EVER!,out of all our toys this one is the best!<br />Kept him entertained. helped build his strength. we kept it with us when we traveled so he could interact with everyone while playing and staying happy.

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,good
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loves it and very easy to put together.
Baby,5.0,Great for entertaining little guys and helping advance motor skills,"This keeps my little guy so entertained. I have watched as his fine and gross motor skills have developed using this fun jumperoo. He pulls, grabs, spins, and observes all while bouncing to his heart's content. I highly recommend it."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,BIEN
Baby,5.0,I love this product,"I love this product! Baby used to drop pacifier and cry so much, now the WubbaNub holds the pacifier in place and if she stops sucking, its still close enough for her to grab. A great gift for a baby shower!"
Baby,5.0,My twins love it!,"I am extremely happy with this purchase!  I bought this when my twins were eight months old, and they loved it right away.  They are almost nine months now, and they still love it.  They really seem to enjoy the jumping action, and they like to reach for the two birds above them (sometimes they pull them out actually, but that hasn't been a problem).  I haven't tried any other jumpers, but it's hard to imagine one that they would like more than this!"
Baby,1.0,One Star,Doesn't really &#34;rattle&#34;.  Would not buy again.
Baby,4.0,Anything to make life easier!,"We use these stoppers for mixing formula right in the baby's bottle. It saves us washing extra containers! We use the Avent Classic bottles and these fit with a tight seal so nothing leaks as I shake the bottle to mix. I also tried the stopper with the Natural bottles and found that the formula would leak a little when I shook it. Great product, but wish they would come with the bottles when you buy them!"
Baby,5.0,This product is absolutely amazing for babies,"This product is absolutely amazing for babies, I plan on getting more in the future. It not only helps with gripping but it also keeps the binky in place so that the baby doesn't keep accidently spitting it out. It arrived on time an the baby loves it. 5/5 from me."
Baby,5.0,... breastmilk in extra bottles we had and it worked beautifully. MUCH better than using bags,Used it to store breastmilk in extra bottles we had and it worked beautifully. MUCH better than using bags.

Baby,3.0,only 1 rattles,Only 1 rattles. The little bug with the wings just has the crunchy paper. I was so disappointed. But hold together well and my little likes them so 3 stars.
Baby,5.0,Stop reading reviews and just buy this thing! It's awesome!,"Super awesome, practical, convenient. Works great on my different strollers. Don't have to take it off/put it on each time I use the stroller because it folds up with the stroller no problem. Love it. Love the price. Definitely a must buy."
Baby,5.0,Works with City Mini stroller (because small can fold stroller ...,Works with City Mini stroller (because small can fold stroller without this getting in the way or having to be taken off)
Baby,5.0,"Attached easily, sturdy construction","Attached easily, sturdy construction, great material. My favorite part is the little hidden zipper pouch inside. It's great to store my wallet or phone when we go on a walk."
Baby,5.0,My son loves this!,"We began putting our son at 4 months and he's loved this from the beginning. He's 9 months now and he still enjoys it, not as long as it used to be earlier on as he is now crawling on the verge to walking, but it is still highly entertaining to him. He loves the toys, loves to jump! Highly recommend."
Baby,4.0,Not bad,"Works great, but it's kind of skimpy on the toys."
Baby,1.0,Defective Unit and Horrible Customer Service = Never Buying Another Product from Withings,"My wife and I recently had our second child, and purchased a second unit because we really enjoyed the first one we received as a gift.  However, we started having problems with the first unit's power port.  We contacted customer service by email because they have no phone number available to the public for support.  Throughout the process I interacted with no less than five people, and constantly had to explain the situation over and over.  From my communications with Withings I discerned that the company knows there is a defective manufacturing issue with its units' power port.  Irrelevant of this fact, they would not replace the unit for me because I could not prove the unit was less than a year old- which I could not do because it was gift.  The most they would do is offer me a 25% coupon on my next purchase.  Having already spent $250 on a baby monitor, my wife and I found it unacceptable to spend another $200 (with a 25% discount coupon) on a monitor that they should have replaced given the fact of a prevalently known manufacturing defect."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My five month old loves this toy.
Baby,5.0,So glad I decided to purchase this,My daughter LOVES this! So glad I decided to purchase this. She would jump all day if I let her
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"love the Quality, and the size without being so huge it is a good plate."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,ok
Baby,5.0,I LOVE WubbaNubs! We have the monkey,"I LOVE WubbaNubs!  We have the monkey, elephant, lion, reindeer, cat and giraffe. It so much easier to keep track of these than a regular pacie.  Plus it is a lot easier for our son to hold onto it.  He can find it and put it in his mouth by himself when regular pacies get lost in his crib or car seat. I'll probably include a wubbanub in every gift I give at a baby shower from now on."
Baby,5.0,Assembles in minutes!,"I personally have not seen the unit, but I sent it to my daughter for my grandson's birth. My daughter stated it was easy to assemble and looks very sturdy. When my grandson is old enough to enjoy it, I can write more then."
Baby,5.0,Awesome: ) daughter loves it,Awesome :) daughter loves it! It's her 4th one
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,i love this and it soooo cute I lose these ones less
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Thank you.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,i ALSO HAVE THE OXO TOT AND PREFER THE OXO. QUALITY IS ok
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Best bouncer ever! My son would stay in this thing forever. All the toys kept his interest. Definitely recommend
Baby,5.0,One happy baby!,My baby loves this! She is still a little to short for the lowest setting so her pediatrician recommended limited use until she is able to be flat footed while seated. I place a pillow under her feet so she can get to bouncing. She loves the multiple toys and lights all around the bouncer. She gets so excited when the music starts when she begins to jump.
Baby,3.0,+Good price and value. - dont hold on stroller ...,"+Good price and value.<br />- dont hold on stroller tight, can move up and down."
Baby,5.0,You can't not have a jumper!,"We originally bought an exersaucer, but it was big and bulky so we returned it.  Our baby started using this at 4 months, although he was a little slouchy and short in it.  It seemed like overnight, somewhere between 4 and 5 months, he fit into it perfectly (well we put a yoga mat underneath to help his toes reach at first).  We use it about 5 times a week for about a half hour at a time, and he loves to explore and jump on it.  I like to fold laundry next to him while he jumps.  We all win!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good product !!!
Baby,5.0,love it!,"Works great, holds drinks and everything else i need to put in there."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My little one can not get enough!
Baby,5.0,Best toy i have purchased!,"One of the best things I have bought for my son.  We started putting him in it around 4 months of age.  At first he could not touch the ground and did not like it too much.  Fast forward to 7 months of age and he is in there for 15-20 minutes at a time jumping away.  He loves it!  He learned to spin with this toy and now bangs the bug (when it isn't in his mouth)  We have a fairly small space, but this does not overwhelm it.  Definitely worth the space it takes up with the joy it brings my son."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Absolutely love this! I wish it played more songs, but still great"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,good!
Baby,5.0,Would make any baby happy,"I love love love this product. I have two, the cheaper version that hangs on the door and this one. I had the other one at first but it was inconvenient if I wanted to use it in the living-room which has no door frames or outside area. He was using the door frame jumpy since around 4 months old. I saw this one at a friend's house and he loved it so much I had to buy it.<br />This is a great thing to have to help your child's muscle development as well. He started sanding so quickly he could barely sit on his own without falling over, but stands on his feet in the jumpy for minutes.<br />We have an outside area with a small swimming pool and he loves being outside the problem is he gets tired of sitting in the high chair or stroller, this is the one thing he never gets tired of. Get it because it will make any baby happy!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,So cute!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great buy!
Baby,5.0,no need to spend any more than this!,This is perfect. 2 cup holders which are collapsible if you would rather maximize the main space. There's also a zippered pocket inside for essentials that you want secured the even when the stroller is folded up (I keep hand sanitizer in there).  I use this both on my Bugaboo Cam3 (I got rid of the useless $25 cupholder) and my Baby Jogger City Mini. I like the fact that it fits within the bars and doesn't get too much in the way.
Baby,5.0,"My son loves tbis, he's 4 and a half ...","My son loves tbis, he's 4 and a half months old and he doesn't stop for hours. This is the only toy that he absolutely loves and is always excited to get into"
Baby,5.0,"Awesome, check for yourself","[[VIDEOID:43b257ab3b6e3b045a3ed9834f592a00]]This thing is amazing. We put our little son in it when he was 4 months old, created a little pedestal because he could not reach. He enjoyed right off the bat, and started jumping and pulling things. Finally, after two weeks, I had to share our satisfaction of this product with Amazon.  Definitely an awesome product from Fisher-Price."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic,Perfect gift for my new grandson!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Excellent! Product just as described. Arrived as expected. Will definitely buy more to add to our WubbaNub collection!
Baby,5.0,Handy and the perfect fit for our Chicco Umbrella Stroller,"Heading to Europe for a month to travel with our 1 year old and wanted to bring the umbrella stroller to keep things compact and simple. This organizer definitely helps with being able to have a cup holder and storage spot. It fits perfectly, and stays compact even when the stroller is folded up. Would definitely buy this as a gift for others!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Awesome Unit.
Baby,5.0,"Toy is much larger than I expected, but baby ...","Toy is much larger than I expected, but baby loves it, especially the ribbons along the saddle, and the tail rings that make a pleasing sound."
Baby,3.0,DIdn't work properly,Arrived and the motion and light didn't work. Sent back for replacement. we'll see if next one works....
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The product is great but I found more cheaper in other store after I bought...
Baby,5.0,Good but does take up a lot of space,"The music is not terribly annoying. Our baby likes it. She makes it about 30 minutes before getting bored. Just enough time to cook dinner. :) This does take up a lot of space and we wish it folded flat so we can hide it away, but those are not deal breakers."
Baby,5.0,My little guy (4 months) loves this so much. ...,My little guy (4 months) loves this so much. We have bought several animals now and he loves them all.

Baby,5.0,GREAT ITEM,BEST MONEY SPENT...SHE STAYS IN IT FOR T LEAST 20 MINUTES INDEPENDENTLY
Baby,5.0,Awesome,"I love this thing!! My daughter is 4 months and she loves being in it. This will keep her entertained and quiet for a while, while I take care of things around the house ie: cooking, cleaning, etc. The ONLY gripe I have about the jumper is that it is a little big and we live in a small apartment. If I had to buy it again, I still would despite the size. It's awesome."
Baby,5.0,Great product,"Product arrived perfectly. This is the 2nd wubbanub pacifier I have purchased as my 1 yr old daughter chewed through the pacifier of her first. She loves this pacifier, the monkey attached makes it much easier to find in the crib on her own. I highly recommend this product."

Baby,5.0,miracle mobile,"Our little girl absolutely adores this mobile. We had another cheaper mobile but she didn't care for the decorations or music at all. This one, however, she loves. The music does get a bit repetitious but compared to other items on the market it has more variety than most, and its pretty soothing. I love that the animal faces look down, thats one of the greatest advantages of this item. Would definitely buy again and buy for friends."

Baby,5.0,he loves jumping and playing in it,My 3 month old loves it!!!!
Baby,5.0,Baby's favorite,"If I had to pick a single favorite hanging toy out of all the ones we have, this would be it.  It's easy to move because it has a velcro hook, not one of the plastic ones that's impossible to open.  And it has a lot of interesting hanging things.  It keeps the baby entertained for a long time."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My kids both loved these pacifiers as babies.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These bottle sealers work great I've never had any leaks.
Baby,5.0,This is great for the price,"This is great for the price, no need to spend 3 times as much for a brand name one. I can even fit it on my Bob Double stroller."
Baby,5.0,5 months and he loved it. Now at 7 months,"I started putting my baby in the bouncer when he was 3.5 months and he loved it. Now at 7 months, he still likes to bounce in it and can use the toys so much easier."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 month old grandson loved this.  It was perfect for his age.
Baby,1.0,Quality is an issue.,One of the plastic pieces that connects the arch to the play mat was broken.  What a disappointment!

Baby,5.0,get it!,"This is such an amazing jumperoo, my daughter just loves it, she will spend hours on it! she has been using it since she was 6 months old, she's now 10 months and still uses it as if it was her 1st time ever on it.  get this product if you have the opportunity ... definetely worth the price"
Baby,5.0,Love it,This is a great product! ! My granddaughter loved it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,not to hard to put together and my 5month old loves it!
Baby,1.0,"Not cute, wrong color","The monkey is dark brown, almost black. Not the same as the photo at all or a monkey color."
Baby,5.0,My 6 month old LOVES this toy! I've noticed ...,My 6 month old LOVES this toy! I've noticed that she's gotten much stronger since we bought this. It really works out those baby legs when they bounce! Very well made.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Everything pops right into place. So simple. Very cute and can't wait to use it.
Baby,3.0,Difficulty detaching a square wipe through a round hole,"The case is a sturdy  built. But getting the wipes out the hole is a headache, they're always getting stuck and torn in the process; round area does not give adequate access to a wide enough surface area to detach one wipe from the others in the case."
Baby,5.0,excellent,Very satified
Baby,5.0,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY INFANT!,"As usual, this product from Fisher Price is outstanding!  My granddaughter loves it!!"
Baby,5.0,Best thing we've bought,"This is the best thing we've bought our son. He loves playing in this and can now touch the floor on the lowest level (4 months old, average length). There are a lot of different things to play with and it keeps him busy for a while!"
Baby,5.0,How did I live without this?,"I can't imagine my life without this Jumperoo.  My little darling absolutely loves it.  Not only is the seat a perfect size to keep her upright and from jostling about too much, but the music and toys keep her entertained for a long time.  It's lightweight so you can move it from room to room.  She absolutely loves bouncing around like crazy.  It's a great product and I recommend all parents have one!"
Baby,5.0,A great value,"For the price, you should buy one for yourself and any expecting mom friend. Fit our old stroller (Ingelsina Zippy from 2009) and I imagine it would fit any the way it has adjustable Velcro tabs to hold it on each handle of the stroller. Two cup holders and plenty of space in the middle. It is made of a substantial material. Easy to wipe clean from spills. A great value overall."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Babies love it, colors are great."
Baby,5.0,Works with Avent Naturals,"I pump at work directly into Avent Naturals bottles (using the Avent Breast Pump Adapter).  Then I use these bottle sealing caps and bring the breastmilk home.  The next day, our caregiver just pops out the sealing cap of the bottle screw ring and pops in a bottle nipple.  Voila - bottle is ready to be heated for feeding.  I haven't experienced any leaking with these caps, but the key is to hear them click into place. Package comes with 6 caps. If you use Avent bottles, these caps help make the pumping/feeding process so much easier!"
Baby,5.0,twin approved!,twins love this toy! keeps them happy in their car seats!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Easy installation.
Baby,5.0,great poduct,Excellent and safety product.
Baby,5.0,Great item!,Great organizational tool.  You cannot see it but it will hold two bottles nice and tightly on each end.  Happy I got this!  Plenty of room for all your doo-dads you need on your walk.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,thanks
Baby,5.0,This one is a winner...,"I just bought this for my 6 month old son and it's hit!  He's never been in a bouncer like this before, but once I put him in it, he immediately figured out how to make himself bounce up and down.  He was all smiles and laughing along with the music.  I thought that installing the cloth on the seat was a little confusing based upon the instructions, but I eventually figured it out (and I am not handy or crafty at all).  So overall, I would say that it was pretty easy to assemble.  My son hasn't figured out how to spin the seat yet, but I am sure he will figure it out eventually.  Once he does, he will discover &#34;new&#34; toys all around the jumper to explore.  That should keep him busy!  So far, this toy is a big hit in our house.  He loves it because it is fun; I love it because it is solid and appears safe.  I would definitely recommend this product."
Baby,4.0,Good jumper,"My kid loved jumping in this, and would even jump himself to sleep sometimes. It has cute toys attached and makes fun noises. The top leaf toys fall out easily if he pulls on them, and it takes up a bit of room, making it awkward to move to a different area of the house, but it is a great jumper over all. I just wish he would have used it for longer!"
Baby,5.0,Love it,"Good quality. Small enough for an umbrella stroller. Not big enough to replace a diaper bag. Perfect for a drink,wallet keys and phone."
Baby,5.0,Perfect,"Holds a lot of wipes, easy to use, and looks nicer than average wipes case. Great for one handed use, and can easily grab one wipe at a time without spending loads of time separating them from each other."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter love it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Cute
Baby,5.0,Love this stroller holder,Love this stroller holder! We have the city jogger stroller and didn't want to pay a fortune on a holder but needed something for my keys and water bottle... This was inexpensive and fits- the Velcro straps make it adjustable so it can go on different stroller types.
Baby,5.0,Monkey,My 8 month old absolutely loves this. Stays cold much longer than the gel ones!!
Baby,5.0,happy with my purchase,"My baby loves jumping in it. It took him a day to learn how to jump in this new toy, but once he mastered it, he actually laughed out loud on himself. The only thing that concerns me is I don't know how long he should be staying there each time. Some readings say baby should not be placed in jumperoo for more than 20 minutes each time. Overall, happy with my purchase, would recommend."
Baby,5.0,A must for any super active babies,"i love, love, love this jumperoo! My son is 7 months and full of energy, he gets bored with most toys and activity centers in minutes. However, from day one with the jumperoo, he can be in at for 20 minutes or more and be super happy. I will be buying one of these for all of my friends when they have babies. Worth every penny!!"
Baby,4.0,"It works, nothing special. Do not put an ...","It works, nothing special. Do not put an open drink it will just spill everywhere! But bottled water or sippy cup will fit and it's got a lot of space"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughters favorite toy!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves this!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter's best friend :)
Baby,5.0,4 month old loves it,"[[VIDEOID:1189e6f92623cfa90a10d63db3e4842a]] I bought this for our 4 months old grandson, he is absolutely going banana on this. Its very entertaining for us us too!"
Baby,5.0,We got it today and can't be happier for our decision to buy the jumper for my ...,We got it today and can't be happier for our decision to buy the jumper for my boy. He even fell asleep after mins of jumping
Baby,5.0,I like that the cup holder portion is stretchy so that ...,This stroller organizer is very similar to the much more expensive Britax model that we have. I like that the cup holder portion is stretchy so that it can accommodate a variety of bottle/cup sizes. It fits very nicely with our Britax Be Agile stroller. The material quality is excellent and comparable to much more expensive products.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Great product, just as described and delivered on time, will shop here again!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby LOVES this! So worth the buy :)
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Really good product
Baby,5.0,"My son love, love","My son love, love, loves his wubbanubs. We have so many different ones, but the monkey is his favorite. I think it's because the legs/tail are so easy to grab. The ONLY thing I DON'T like is that the paci that comes on them is for 0-6 months. My son just turned 1. He doesn't use a paci during the day but won't sleep without his wubbanub. The problem is, I noticed that the paci was starting to rip because he has a mouth full of teeth and apparently these are only suggested for babies without teeth. I threw away monkey and replaced him with frog, then with the dinosaur. I'm starting to worry so I'm looking to replace it with a different type of paci that's made for older babies. It's just sad because he loves the wubbanub. It's so easy for him to grab when he's half awake during the night and he goes right back to sleep. I don't think he'll be able to find just a paci. I saw something called paci plushie that lets you attach the animal to any paci. I might try that big you have a baby without teeth though, wubbanub are the BEST!!!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good
Baby,5.0,Absolutely amazing and worth the price,"Absolutely amazing and worth the price. I was skeptical at first because I was purchasing it for my 4 month grandson and wasn't sure how stable he would be being so small but it provided a perfect fit. He absolutely loves it. It spins around, has three adjusting levels as the child gets bigger, music, and lots of toys and colors to keep an infant busy! I would buy again and recommend!"
Baby,5.0,My daughter loves this jumper!,I have a rather tall 5 month old that has been using this you for about a month. She loves it! If she is fussy or just restless I put her in the jumper for a bit. She laughs me tires herself out in a hurry! There are so many toys on it to keep her busy and the music and sounds are adorable. I highly recommend it!
Baby,1.0,Disappointing to me!,"The products is the same as the picture, but one of them does not rattle, and the other simply rattles a little bit. Because they are named as wrist rattles, I feel disappointed."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Son loves this jumper
Baby,5.0,Great invention!,Perfect and so useful!
Baby,3.0,Great entertainment for short bursts,Good entertainment for my baby but my doctor told me it's bad for her developing to walk. So I had to return it. She was starting to stand and walk only on her tip toes.
Baby,4.0,The padding on the top of the seat should be better.,Overall met expectations. The padding on the top of the seat should be better.
Baby,3.0,Baby is 6 months old and not tall enough to use,"Pros:<br />-Overall easy to put together (a lot of pieces but the instructions are decent and it's pretty intuitive)<br />-It is very much as the pictures indicate - no surprised (except that it really is quite big!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It's bright and plastic and nothing you really want in your home (but again, very much like the picture shows); I tend to like more contemporary looking items<br />-I have it set to the lowest height (for smaller babies) and my sons toes still don't touch the ground.  He is 6 months old. No where on the site, packaging or instructions does it indicate any sort of height requirement. They only list a weight max and that they baby must be holding his/her head up.  The instructions say very clearly to set the height to where your baby's toes are touching the ground. No where does it state what to do if they don't touch the ground. Other reviewers seemed to have this same problem and they've place books under the jumper - but who wants to do that?!?!?  I called customer service but they were closed - only open M-F 9-6pm eastern time.  Very disappointed.  So now I have this huge jumper that I spent 30 minutes putting together sitting in my living room and we can't use it yet."
Baby,4.0,Great buy!,My baby loved this. The only thing I have to complain about was I wish it was a bit easier to change the height of the chair. But really besides that it was awesome!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,fits perfect !!!
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it...,Eventhough my son is a 3month old. He absolutely loves it even he is not &#34;strong&#34; yet. Can't wait to see him progress with this jumperoo.<br />You can view my son in action via the link below.<br /><br />http://youtu.be/JE7qvqf50Gs
Baby,5.0,Great for Baby Jogger strollers,"We use this on our Baby Jogger City Mini stroller. It is the best.  Parents ask me all the time what it is and where I got it.  Holds two water bottles, two phones, keys, tissues, doggie bags, etc."
Baby,5.0,... this organizer on my Britax B Agile and I love it! Holds 2 drinks,"I have this organizer on my Britax B Agile and I love it! Holds 2 drinks, my keys, phone, and whatever treasures my 6 year old finds in the park on our walks. It stays on when the stroller is folded up. For such a low price, it doesn't get any better!"
Baby,2.0,Three Stars,It keeps opening in the diaper bag! Then after only a few months the red cover kept popping off! Never did keep my wipes wet! Total waste of money!
Baby,5.0,Best thing we have bought for him,My grandson loves it. He bounces all day long. Best thing we have bought for him.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Best toy ever
Baby,5.0,perfect!,Baby loves it.  So worth the money and great price on amazon.
Baby,5.0,My kids love it. It was so eaey to assemble,My kids love it.  It was so eaey to assemble. Doesn't take too much space. Reasonable price  and full of fun.
Baby,5.0,sgsgdgdhshdh,djsyshashssh
Baby,2.0,Wouldn't recommend.,"Barely fit around my babies wrist. He's not really interested in them. The one that's suppose to rattle, barely makes noise. Wouldn't recommend."
Baby,5.0,This is the toy our little one has enjoyed the most so far,"This is the toy our little one has enjoyed the most so far. She's only 4 month old and she loves to bounce all the time! A little bit big and kind of bulky for a small apartment, but definitely worth it when you see her smile!"
Baby,5.0,It's supports him and is so easy for him to jump,My 3 month old son LOVES this!! It's supports him and is so easy for him to jump! 5 stars!!
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,it would be better if it moved
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Excellent, baby loves it"
Baby,5.0,Adorable,Very good baby girl. Very soft.
Baby,5.0,Wonderful exercise for the baby,Wonderful exercise for the baby! and the baby really loves it.<br /><br />The seat cover fades if you use wash machine. So don`t wash it with other clothes.
Baby,3.0,Came in the mail a little wrinkled. But it ...,"Came in the mail a little wrinkled. But it does the job and for th price, it's worth getting it."
Baby,5.0,Nice array of visual and tactical stimulation and functional in many play environments,"Of all the hanging toys we have, this one is great for our 4 month old.  She doesn't quite have the coordination to manipulate the individual parts but is delighted when she touches one of the items and everything wiggles a little bit.  She does seem to enjoy the nice mix of shapes and textures which allows her to interact with this toy for lengthy periods without getting bored.  Its great for holding in front of the baby by hand, or attaching to a play gym."
Baby,5.0,Great Product,"Our son loved this Jumperoo and it afforded us many a moment of relief for aching backs (he always wanted to be held..). He's already grown out of it, but we hope that our infant daughter will love it as much once she is old enough to use it. We actually enjoyed the Jumperoo so much that we bought one for our nephew. It was a hit in their home as well."
Baby,5.0,He gets awfully bored with his swing,"I bought this for my 2 month old and he loves it! He gets awfully bored with his swing, chair and playmat, and he loves to try to stand. This is perfect to give his legs the exercise they need. He's still a tad too short to touch the ground, but nothing that a small pillow can't solve. Delivery was super quick!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I'm happy.
Baby,5.0,Good for price,great for the price. which is covered center for when my iphones in there exposed
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my kid loves this jumper!

Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect you ever
Baby,5.0,Works fantastic as I have a place for phone,"Use this stroller organizer on my City Mini/Versa stroller.  Works fantastic as I have a place for phone, keys, small wallet, skippy cups and water for me."
Baby,5.0,great,"the cutest thing.  call my youngest grandchild monkey so this was perfect.  it was her security item.  now that she has been weaned from the pacifier, we cut the pacifier off and she still lugs the monkey part around with her"
Baby,5.0,This was great quality and surprisingly sturdy for $8,"This was great quality and surprisingly sturdy for $8. Wish i had ordered it earlier, after i lost the attached cupholder (it broke off) of my stroller over a year ago. The two spaces for drinks are sort of small; would hold a standard size water bottle or can, but not something larger. You could always put a larger bottle in the bigger compartment. Works great for me, as i usually have a can of seltzer with me and my keys and cell phone, which i worry about getting lost if i just toss it in the bottom of the stroller. This is perfect and was cheap."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,could be a bit bigger
Baby,5.0,A little more than others... But the service AFTER the sale was worth it to me!,"This monitor has been a staple our daughter's bedroom since day one...  The temperature, humidity, night light, music, and remote viewing are what sold us on this one.<br /><br />Recently it began to have issues holding a charge, and finally it &#34;died&#34; as it had no power.  Withings support has been amazing the last day and a half.  Emails with specific questions and answers and pictures that I sent yielded a diagnosis that required the monitor be replaced.  They arranged for a UPS return at their cost and as soon as I shared the active tracking number, they emailed me a coupon code for a free replacement.  This monitor may be a little more expensive than others that are out there... But the service AFTER the sale is what would make me a repeat Withings customer."
Baby,4.0,Super cute and colorful,Super cute and colorful. Pretty easy to put together. But for a bit older baby. Way too big for our four month old.
Baby,5.0,perfect!,"I just received this and haven't used it yet, but it's exactly what I was looking for! Great quality and great price! It's the perfect size, not too small and too big, and fits perfectly with my baby jogger city mini."
Baby,3.0,good for the price!,doesn't clasp as well as I hoped for. does connect by the strap well tho.
Baby,5.0,Definitely Recommend!! My son loves it!!,"I did lots of research before purchasing and compared several jumperoo versions so glad I picked this one! My son loves it!! Great for 10-20 minutes to get things done.  My son is still on the first setting at almost 6 months and has yet to realize it's full jumping and turning potential.  But he enjoys his time here especially since he's at the stage where he'd rather be standing...ALL the time. Lol.  His favorite aspect as of yet for some reason is the butterfly, he loves to hold it, taste it, babble to it and yet again chew on it :-)"
Baby,5.0,No spills,Great product! I needed them for my starters ser that came without the sealing discs and these fit perfectly. Just make sure to ajust the ring tightly and no spills!
Baby,5.0,And I love it too,My kid loves this thing. And I love it too. I love that he can grab it and play with the monkey. I will be buying these for all future children.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it!
Baby,5.0,a great investment.,this is everything it says in description. ..a great investment ... baby enjoys for hours
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Looks like a fun toy and great teether!
Baby,1.0,Too Quiet,It was so quiet the baby couldn't even hear it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,1.0,Our baby is within the height and weight range recommended for the product,"This product has caused ankle and foot joint problems in my baby after using it lightly (our baby used it for about 5-10 minutes 1-2 times a day for a little over 3 weeks).  Our baby is within the height and weight range recommended for the product, and I set up the product height at the highest level 3 so that our baby's toes very lightly pointedly touch the floor when in a still position just as in the instructions, and this encourages baby to tiptoe while jumping and his toes curl inward when he jumps and lands and the pressure of his body weight and the height momentum from jumping puts unnatural amount of pressure especially into his inwardly curled big toes and it is causing problems in the natural standing stance of my baby.  I noticed that after using this product, my baby stiffly tries to avoid putting weight on his feet as if he cannot flex his foot in his natural standing position and even if I manage to get him to place some of his body weight on his feet, he can only manage to slightly touch the floor with his big toe only as if he cannot naturally stand upright using the whole surface of the bottom of his feet. He lifts his legs up from the floor as if it hurts to place his weight on his feet and cannot keep his feet flexed in a natural position.  This is a very dangerous product for babies and I do NOT recommend parents use this product for their baby."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,mr monkey!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Yep, keeps her busy"
Baby,1.0,One Star,Awful
Baby,3.0,... wings also don't make that much noise but she liked them,Doesn't rattle as loud as one I had gotten 10 years ago and the butterfly's wings also don't make that much noise but she liked them anyway
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Perfect for our city select double stroller. Cheap but great quality.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Bought as a gift for someone else! Exactly what I wanted.
Baby,5.0,This Line of Product should get 10 out of 5. A MUST BUY,"This is an excellent product. We got it at 3.5 months and just wished we had gotten it earlier.<br /><br />Initially the child will fuss but later on will start loving it. Best part is you can leave the baby in it close to you and do your work, The baby will be busy exploring and you get 30 to 40 minutes of free time.<br /><br />Absolutely love it."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,"Great little cup holder/organiser, very sturdy and surprisingly inexpensive. The zippered mesh pocket is very useful, perfect for your phone. Very happy, thanks."
Baby,2.0,Great Idea But Latch Comes Undone,"I loved the concept and design of this product; however, the latch will not stay closed. My wipes are always drying up because the latch comes undone in my diaper bag (even when I adhere extra tape to the latch). I love Skip Hop's products, but I believe this case's design can be improved."
Baby,5.0,Works great. My new stroller didn't have a parent console ...,"Works great. My new stroller didn't have a parent console on it. I ordered this and it works great. It's big enough to hold my wallet, cell phone and two water bottles. Can't beat it for the price."
Baby,3.0,Not as I expected,"I bought this based on reviews. I have to say, I expected so much more.<br />For it's price point, I feel comparable toys have more to offer.<br /><br />It's a good toy, and there's nothing wrong with it, I'd probably leave it at a grandparents house &buy a more interactive one in the future."
Baby,4.0,No more lost binkys!,"My son kept losing his binky in his crib, this helps so much. Could be a bit more better quality but it works!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,good
Baby,4.0,good monitor,Battery life is pretty good. Picture quality is nice. There is a slight delay in video.
Baby,5.0,Great!,"Works perfect with my Omni Urbini stroller, has all the comparments I need, and it was inexpensive. Perfect!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 4month old granddaughter loves this
Baby,5.0,6-month old heartily endorses,Cutest thing ever.  Our granddaughter loves it.  It's a pacifier and a stuffed animal all in one.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money or time,Don't waste your money or time. This item is a piece of crap and not reliable. Worked great for the first couple of months but then began dropping the signal. Have to restart over and over... Doesn't maintain connection and we find ourselves spending more time restarting than viewing our child. Get a better made product.
Baby,5.0,I can't say enough on how much I love this thing,I can't say enough on how much I love this thing.  It has been great for my daughter.  She started using it not too long after arriving in this world and I feel like it helped her in going to sleep and staying asleep.  Once she got a little older she was able to grab the monkey and put the pacifier in her own mouth when she wanted it.  If you are looking for a type of lovey that will help you baby go to sleep I recommend using this one!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Excellent plate! Sturdy, durable, and the kiddos love it. Would buy again! Other dinosaurs would be awesome!"
Baby,4.0,Too long for my carseat,I purchased to put on my 3 month olds car seat but it hangs too low. I tried placing the toy on the highest point of the handle for the carseat but it was still too long. Every time my baby tries to play with the toy he gets frustrated because it swings and hits him in the face. I'll probably wait and use this in my child's next carseat or with his stroller. Other than it hanging too low this is a great toy and my kid loves it.
Baby,5.0,Love it! Our little guy enjoys this so much,"Love it! Our little guy enjoys this so much! Easy to put together (I say that but my husband was the one who assembled it, lol!) and loads of fun. It has helped to strengthen his legs and core muscles. Also, it allows me to actually get some things done which on some days, isn't always easy. Definitely recommend!"
Baby,5.0,Perfect Travel Wipe Container,Got this for my sister and her new baby... She loves it! Holds more than enough wipes for a daily outing with the little one!
Baby,5.0,"Fits Natural Bottles, was redesigned.","I got 9oz and 4oz Avent Natural bottles with this adapter. I've used classic bottles and hated that third adapter ring for the 9oz classic bottles. I am so glad they got rid of those for the Naturals. These lid caps seal the bottle of the Naturals bottles perfectly. They do not snug in like the old classics but it is also made of a different material that seems able to take the heat of sterilization but I won't be boiling these so I am not sure. But the cap DOES fit in the Naturals bottle, and the actual new packaging says &#34;for classic and natural&#34; so it has been redesigned to be universal. The disc also fits just firmly enough to not leak liquid when the lid is screwed on but not so firmly that it is a pain to remove. I love that this disc stays in the lid when unscrewed for the most part so I am not dropping it on the floor like with the disappointing Nuk bottle adapters.<br />So basically this makes the classic and natural bottle into a storage container without nipple. It stays together when unscrewed and does not allow liquid to leak during shaking and travel. Love the Avent Natural collection with this lid!"
Baby,5.0,"Love, love","Love, love, love this!!  I don't think there is much more to say.  My now 7 month old daughter has been using this since she was 5 months and she loves it."
Baby,5.0,I'm glad we had this,"This was a lifesaver once our little guy got too big for his swing.  Although he lost interest after a few months (once he was mobile and didn't want to be contained), I'm glad we had this!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,100% recomended
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Greatest invention! This is the best baby shower gift! Can be used from birth and long after!
Baby,5.0,She loved then and loves it still,"I bought this when my daughter was 4 1/2 months old.  Even at the lowest setting she could not quite touch the ground so we put a hard cushion under her feet.  She loved then and loves it still, she is almost 7 months.  I have a small house so I love that I can fold it and move it out of the way.  It was also generally easy to put together, no screws or bolts to deal with.  I would purchase this product again."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Easy assembly, my 4mth old loves it !"
Baby,5.0,Goes crazy jumping like a maniac and laughing,"My daughter loves it.  Goes crazy jumping like a maniac and laughing.  I kinda like the music, too."
Baby,5.0,"Our son loves this thing, has since the moment ...","Our son loves this thing, has since the moment we put him in it (~4 months if I remember correctly).  He is on the tallest setting now (at about 10 months, but he is a really all kid) and still loves it.  We've watched him change interest in the different toys on it over the past 6 months, so it has really kept him engaged.  But the biggest thing he loves is really the jumping & ability to be upright without one of us."
Baby,4.0,perfect solution for storing- works on natural avent bottle,I tested these out on my natural plastic avent bottles using water to see if it locked or would leak... I shook the bottle and turned upside down. I know many people were concerned about this only working with classic bottles but so far seems to work when I tested it ok with the plastic avent natural bottles as well.  I haven't had my baby yet (due in about 2 weeks) but I think this will be the perfect solution for storing milk.  Also- if anyone is looking for adaptors for breast pumps... I am planning to breast feed and pump using the medela breast pump.  I ordered the maymom conversion kit to use with the medela pump and they fit perfectly so I can pump directly into my avent bottles.  Hope this review is helpful for other moms and mommy to be's =)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Our grand-daughter absolutely LOVES this jumper!
Baby,5.0,Bought this for grandmas house for when my son is ...,"Bought this for grandmas house for when my son is over there.  He loves to jump in his 'bouncy, bouncy!'  So much for him to do in this activity center.  He stays content for a long time."
Baby,5.0,she squeals and laughs and jumps - its so much fun to watch her play on this jumper,"My daughter absolutely loves this jumper.. we bought this when she was 5 months old, she used to play okay with it. But now, at 6 months she adores it.. she squeals and laughs and jumps - its so much fun to watch her play on this jumper. That said, i only put her on this 10 mins in the morning when i am having breakfast and 10 mins in the evening."

I got mainly to use as cup holders and wasn't a 100% satisfied at first because it sits at a slight angle(I have a city mini). But it really  helped me be organized. The cups are held at an angle but they don' t spill after you take a few sips. So, overall it's been a good purchase."
Baby,5.0,Perfect as a Gift!,"I buy these all the time as gifts. They are such cute little things, and are always high quality. This one was no exception! It also came with a product tag that had safety and cleaning information, which is nice for new parents. I plan on buying many more in the future."
Baby,3.0,you get what you pay for. this was an ...,you get what you pay for. this was an organizer for my second stroller and I was trying to avoid spending more for a back up - it will do the trick to an extent but it isn't as stable as my more expensive one. So if you are getting it for drinks and other items that require a more secure environment - I'd say buy up.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,a lot smaller than I thought it would be
Baby,5.0,Better and cheaper than buying a stroller holder for the ...,Better and cheaper than buying a stroller holder for the britax b-agile. Save your money and get one of these.
Baby,5.0,I purchased this again and it just like my first,I had one and sold it when we thought there were no more grandkids.  I purchased this again and it just<br />like my first.  Baby loves it and it was less expensive at Amazon than the Baby Big Box store.
Baby,5.0,All we needed in an organizer...,"Nice stroller organizer.  Has everything we need in an organizer... bottle/drink holder and compartment for snacks, lotions, napkins, etc."
Baby,5.0,Love the monkey,Love the monkey! the only bad thing is that it's not detachable to replace but I sewed a new one to it.
Baby,5.0,Great jumper,Sturdy and keeps my baby's attention! The seat is easy to detach and throw in the washer if it gets soiled. Highly recommend this product.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It's greaT
Baby,5.0,Baby jail..I mean gym works great!,I was hesitant since my 6 month old does not like being confined. She was never a fan of the swing but she really likes this gym. She can jump up and down and loves teething on the toys. Also she can turn around in the seat so that's a plus! She only lasts a good 20 minutes but that's more her then the gym.
Baby,5.0,They both loved being in this thing,"Used this for both our girls. They both loved being in this thing. Very easy to adjust for height and growth. We usually put a pillow on the floor under their feet but that was just us, don't think it is needed. Loved all the variety of toys, colors, and sounds/lights. Also loved that it spins completely around just by kid power."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Niice sturdy product.  Easy to put together.  Baby loves it!
Baby,5.0,Cute plate,"We were very pleased with these plates. They are very sturdy and seem durable, and we hope they will last for a long time. The colors are fun and bright. I especially love the various sections and so does my son. He likes to have a place for his syrup/ketchup/dip so this is perfect."
Baby,5.0,It was a little too much for my new baby ...,It was a little too much for my new baby but now at 6 month it's one of the favorites!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My son loves it!
Baby,5.0,Monkey for my little monkey.,I got it quickly and it was exactly what I thought it would be!
Baby,5.0,Greatest Binky ever!,I can't rave about this product enough. It is perfectly designed to stay in Baby's mouth and easy for him to grab and put into his mouth himself. Also easy for Mom or Dad to find in the crib the middle of the night without turning the lights on. From now on I will buy one to attach to the package of every baby shower gift that I give.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Good product.
Baby,5.0,Great quality for the price,Fits my double stroller. Great quality for the price. Excellent value.
Baby,5.0,but this is awesome! With adjustable straps,"I was a little skeptical because of the low price (compared to $30 for a name brand), but this is awesome! With adjustable straps, it fits my BoB perfectly. The cup holders are large enough to contain my giant cup of iced coffee, and there's the right amount of space for my wallet, phone, keys and a baby toy or two. I highly recommend this organizer!"
Baby,5.0,Good chewing toys at the end and loops allow you ...,Daughter loves this toy!  It's quiet enough to allow her to use in church. Good chewing toys at the end and loops allow you to add toys on the end.
Baby,5.0,great product,Works great with our mcclaren triumph!
Baby,1.0,Did not work,"I'm fairly tech savvy and couldn't get this thing to work. Yes, I read and followed the directions.  I contacted customer service and received no response.  Amazon (as always) was great about returning it for full refund."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby will love this
Baby,5.0,Great for five month old baby,My five month old daughter loves this thing and the music isn't too annoying like most toys for infants
Baby,5.0,Hilarious,"My daughter absolutely love this. It is hilarious to see her jumping and playing in her Jumperoo. She has been in here ever since she was 5 months, but we limit her time in it for only 3 days out of the week."
Baby,5.0,WubbaNub's are wonderful and well worth the money,WubbaNub's are wonderful and well worth the money.  I have bought Many for shower gifts.  They have enough weight to help keep them in the infants mouth and not spit out.  They infants also get a hold of the little legs or arms & hang on to them.  These are much easier to see in a crib or when your shopping and loose it.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.
Baby,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Fantastic cup-holder/organizer! Came just as pictured, fits on our Bugaboo Chameleon perfectly and they want $40 for theirs!! Can hold two cups and lots of stuff in the middle, looks great and velcro straps make it super easy to mount and adjust."
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Love hate relationship with this jumper. Our daughter loves it and finds it entertaining but it sure is ugly.
Baby,5.0,but I am extremely happy with this one,"My son loves this jumper!  I researched quite a few and finally decided on this one.  I'm sure there are others that are efficient,  but I am extremely happy with this one."
Baby,5.0,Works great with city mini!,Got these to use with my city mini. Works like a charm!
Baby,5.0,a must have luxury for babies,we got this ahead of time and used blankets on the floor so our infants feet can make contact.<br /><br />We LOVE this thing.. it keeps babies occupied and safe.
Baby,5.0,Worth It,"My daughter is 4 months old and loves this bouncy seat, and I love watching her bounce and laugh and play with the toys. One of the best purchases I've made for her so far."
Baby,5.0,Perfect fit for Uppababy Cruz,"Fits our Uppababy Cruz perfectly at a significantly better price than other products. Fits wster bottle, coffee, portfolio wallet, keys, etc without tipping over. Very pleased with this purchase."
Baby,5.0,These are easy to pop into the lid I already have and ...,I'd been trying to find caps for my advent bottles to transport pumped breastmilk to from work.  These are easy to pop into the lid I already have and don't leak.  Exactly what I needed!
Baby,1.0,Sound Doesn't Work - Withings has the worst customer service,"The sound doesn't work on the app. After a few months of working, now I can't hear anything but static on the iPhone and iPad apps. I've contacted Withings Customer Service twice and they have not responded. This is a major safety issue for parents, I can't believe Withings would be so irresponsible."
Baby,5.0,wish I would have purchased sooner,Thing thing is great.. my son is 6 months old and he loves it!
Baby,5.0,Great quality. But does take up alot of real ...,Great quality.  But does take up alot of real estate in your living room.
Baby,5.0,"Perfect toy: the baby loves it, it is safe and washable","This toy is absolutely amazing!! I got it for my god-daughter when she was 3 months old, and it became her favorite toy. She is almost a year now and she stills loves it! Her Mom has washed it more tan 10 times now and it still looks pretty well.<br />It is safe for her...and others when she throws it away, hehe."
Baby,2.0,Toxic Red Powder Coming off the Chair?,"Our baby loves this product. We have had it a few months. Function wise is good.  But recently noticed the chair cushion was starting to flake.<br />A red powder started to come off the seat.  I know, this is not good.  Since the baby would breath this in.  Will have to contact manufacturer."
Baby,5.0,Literally the best money I've spent,Godsend.  Literally the best money I've spent.
Baby,4.0,"Well made product, only your child can determine how useful it really is.","I like this item, but when we had to put the setting on 3 for my daughter, one of the straps was off a bit and made it almost impossible to insert the metal bar. I would say, if you can get this item used, you are better off. The littles don't really get to use it for too long and depending on your child, depends on how long they will actually sit in it. For my third child, this item has not been a great hit, but I gave it 4 stars because it is made well, (other than the strap issue) and I think many children will like it. I can also get a anywhere from 5-30 minutes of freedom from having to entertain my little."
Baby,4.0,he can now hold the arms a little better to keep the pacifier in his mouth or grab ...,"My son is 4 months now, we bought it when he was 3 months, he can now hold the arms a little better to keep the pacifier in his mouth or grab it. Just wish it came with bag to clean it."
Baby,5.0,Ok,Ok item. Works fine.
Baby,4.0,Cute for very short breaks (5-15 mins max),Baby bounces in this and gets bored before I know it. Baby prefers exersaucer although he can't bounce in the exersaucer so it's not really comparable. It DOES WORK to keep baby entertained.. just not for as long as I hoped it would. Have been using it since baby was 6 months and he's almost 11 months now.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love! !!!
Baby,5.0,Fun..Bright..Jumper!!,"Love, love, love this jumper.  Bought this for grand baby.  She loves this and has so much fun. I actually bought this when she was 4 mos and put a pillow under her feet. My daughter said she was too little! Well don't tell grandma... We know what we are doing... As long as your child can hold up their heads they will be find. They will love this jumper. This jumper has settings that are adjustable when they grow. The only thing I don't like is that elephant faces the wrong way. But it's meant to be turn ( with effort ) by the baby. Everything else is awesome. All the colors are great!!! She loves the. Oh she pull down the parrot once which scare me.  That could be dangerous.  So raise it up. But she still jumps higher to grab it!!! The whole point! Build those leg muscles!!!! I enjoy watching my granddaughter play and laugh in this jumper I think your kid would too. It's unisex color too. Thank goodness. Grandson on the way!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Wonderful jumper...well made.  We love it!
Baby,5.0,Big Hit with 5 month old grandson!,Grandson LOVED it! Was easy to put together and everyone really like it.
Baby,5.0,"Easy to install, all in one monitor",The must have all in one baby monitor!
Baby,2.0,These might be knockoffs. My son had used the ...,These might be knockoffs.  My son had used the same wubbanub for 20 months and never had an issue with the pacifier portion. Bought this as a replacement and within a week there were holes in the pacifier portion.  That's a choking hazard and extremely dangerous.  Just bought another replacement at Nordstrom and again no issues on pacifier part.
Baby,3.0,dud for now,my kid doesn't like itvery much.  maybe she will grow into jumping but at 7 months...it's a dud so far.  Product seems ok.  but doesn't interest her.  so product ok.  ability to interest my child not ok.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,ok
Baby,5.0,Great Toy!,We're very happy with this product. There are lots of interactive toys to play with. Our 5 month old grand baby loves it. It has 3 size levels so she can grow and continue to play in it. The only hard part about putting it together was fastening the cloth seat onto the plastic frame.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Our little guy loves this thing and will jump like crazy in it.
Baby,5.0,Great developmental toy!,"This plush toy is exactly as described! My daughter loses interest in things easily but loves this item just as much today as she did the day it arrived. It is a perfect accessory for your little ones carseat, stroller, activity center, etc. that they won't outgrow for a while. It is great for teething and aiding in your child's development. Quality product, highly recommend."
Baby,5.0,My greatgrandson loves it,"The little boy loves it. Having teethed he eats pacifiers as he would candy, if permitted. WubbaNub is offered at a good price and are quality product.. He insists on the gobblegoods having a soft cuddly toy, and this one (and the others I ordered like it) is perfect for him."
Baby,4.0,very nice,Bery nice
Baby,5.0,Can't live without these!,"We love Wubba's at our house!! My son always had a hard time keeping his pacifier in his mouth which meant I was constantly putting it back in for him. The plushy on the Wubba's help the pacifier not only stay in, but make it easy for him to grab and stick back in his mouth. Especially helpful at night time. Love them!!!"
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,worked great with my baby jogger summit x3 until the strap broke.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product for the price!!
Baby,4.0,5 m/o baby loves bouncing! Toys need revamp IMO! FP customer service is Fab!,5m/o Baby loves bouncing in this! Not my favourite - music wise but not too annoying! It's an old design (2007/8'?!) toy so i feel like the toy stations could do with some improvements as i don't think it's very challenging or fine tunes motor skills as a piano or electronic book would be. My fave feature is that you can reduce foot print of it when needed. Also FP have the BEST customer service as I was having issues with the electronic toy!
Baby,5.0,Great repurposed chair caddy,This item was repurposed as a remote control caddy for a wooden rocking chair. I couldn't be more happy with the item for the price.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Super cute!! Love love LOVE THIS ITEM!!
Baby,5.0,Great Jumper!,"My daughter is 6.5 months old and really enjoys spending time in this. We bought it when she was 4.5 months and while she enjoyed it, she was probably a little young. She has started to really bounce in it and realize that there's other object all the way around her.<br />It was easy to put together and seems solid. I hope you enjoy watching your little one in this as much as we do."
Baby,4.0,Great little product.,Good product for the price. Cupholder holds a Starbucks grande-sized cup no problem.
Baby,5.0,Great toy for high energy Baby!,"I bought this for my 6 month old Grandson who visits on Saturdays. The first week he moved around in it a little but spent most of his time looking at the toys. The second weekend he jumped for 45 minutes in one sitting. He puts his arms out when we walk by it asking to play. He was falling asleep it in today and when I started to pull him out he protested and started jumping again.<br />The leaves at the top do come off if the baby can jump high enough and grab them. He is very challenged by this and can eventually get the blue one in his hands. The seat is snug so while he is jumping around, he isn't bouncing back and forth in it like he has been in a walker. There is one toy (bee?) that he can pull up and put in his mouth. He loves the crinkle sound it makes and usually has it in his mouth. (It stays attached to the Jumperoo.)<br />This worth every penny and may be the best toy I have purchased for him so far."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very sturdy and super cute!
Baby,4.0,just what I needed!!!!,"does the job at hand perfectly. Just don't expect to fit TOO LARGE of a bottle in the cup holder. They fit a standard sized large water bottle (20 oz.) just fine, but anything bigger than that will cause an issue with the fit."
Baby,5.0,This is just what I expected! No surprises here ...,This is just what I expected! No surprises here. :) Simple and seems to be well made. The straps are Velcro so they are able to adjust to different handle sizes and diameters. It was cheap too!!! Always a plus when there is so much to buy when it comes to kids!!!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Like this product for the price and quality. Fits my City Mini stroller perfectly without sagging.
Baby,5.0,Works great.,Works great.
Baby,5.0,We love this jumperoo,This is such a great product. My son loves it and it was very easy to assemble.
Baby,5.0,Love it!,One of our favorite baby toys EVER!! We received it as a gift with our first child and now we are using it with our third. It certainly is built to last and our babies have loved it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,As described! Baby loves it!
Baby,5.0,Great for keeping little ones entertained!,"When purchasing items for my son (currently 4 months), I have tried to focus on buying items that he would be able to use for awhile. Baby items are expensive and I don't want to purchase new things every couple of weeks. My son has been looking for more activities, but he cannot yet sit up on his own. I asked friends for recommendations on some sort of play station and love for this Jumperoo was pretty universal.<br /><br />We have had it now for a couple of weeks and my son loves it! He is a little small, but can hold his head upright, which is an absolute must before putting a child in this. Because he is still so short, we put a pillow under his feet so he can jump around. The height can be adjusted as kids get taller too as there are 3 different height settings.<br /><br />While he hasn't yet discovered that the seat can spin around to the various &#34;stations,&#34; he seems to love that no matter which way he turns his head there is something fun to look at and play with. (Until he gets the hang of it, I rotate the seat for him.)<br /><br />I envision my son getting quite a few month's worth of enjoyment out of this so I consider this money well spent. Right now he will play in it for half an hour to an hour at a time because there's so much to do, and this is the longest he will play with any one &#34;toy&#34; at the moment!<br /><br />I highly recommend this, though I do caution that it's a pretty big item and probably not ideal for small spaces."
Baby,5.0,Fabulous jumpy seat!,"My 4 month old grandson absolutely loved this jumpy seat from the first second I put him in it.  He has discovered the jumping part of it and can stay happy in it for long periods.  That, in itself, is worth every penny."
Baby,5.0,GREAT product,Perfect for changing a feeding bottle (nipple in) to a storage bottle when sending breastmilk to daycare.<br />Only tried with AVENT natural nipple bottles. I'm not sure if they'd fit with the regular AVENT ones.
Baby,5.0,AMAZING PRODUCT,She LOVES it. My baby is 5 months old fits perfect in it she plays in it for a while without getting bored. Amazing product for the price. Great product
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Loved it. And my baby too.
Baby,5.0,Jump jump jump,My little girl loves it! She swings side to side and she jumps in it too. She chews on the little bee cause she is teething. Easy to put together and very safe
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Very nice though seems to work better using wifi therefore range isn't that great in our experience.
Baby,5.0,"1 year later, using on city select","I have a baby jogger city select stoller and have really liked this organizer. I have had it for a year now and it's still in great shape. It's constantly being used, I can't imagine just having 1 of those plastic cup holders, because I use this for my phone, keys, paci, more than 1 cup at a time. I tried the skip hop one, and I didn't like how it stretched on the handle; this one keeps it's shape. When I got this one, it was also a good price; I could by 2 for the price of one skip hop or britax version. In the picture, I had three kids cups and my own water bottle. You can fit 2 normal bottles easily in the main section if needed. With a city select, if you have a seat in the highest position pushing against the organizer, lifting the handle to the highest position will allow you to have more room. The same goes with any other organizer on this stroller. You can also still put your diaper bag on the stroller. I do it all the time with the organizer attached. Your diaper bag would just hang lower than the organizer. Also, there's no need to remove it when closing the stroller. Works great on my maclaren umbrella stroller as well!"
Baby,4.0,Saved My Sanity,"The Rainforest Jumperoo from Fisher-Price was a major saver of my sanity. I had a very fussy little one who was only happy in a standing position. As soon as we put her in the Jumperoo, she felt happy. I think she felt secure due to the design of the product. She really was not a very big &#34;jumper&#34; but she loved playing with the toys over her head and simply just being in a standing position. My only negative thing is that even when she was 12 months old, her feet would not reach the floor on the lowest setting. She was short (about 20 percentile) but I definitely think this could be improved."
Baby,5.0,"Good price, simple to put on and fulfills its ...","Good price, simple to put on and fulfills its purpose.  Can be left on even when stroller is folded and put away."
Baby,5.0,Excellent!,My daughter loves this. I like how you can adjust the height.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son liked this toy in first glance. Keeps him occupied during short car trips.
Baby,5.0,GREAT toy for my 3-month-old grandson,GREAT toy for my 3-month-old grandson... kept his attention longer than some other toys we hung on his bouncy seat.
Baby,5.0,Works great for what we need it for,Works great for what we need it for. Holds our daughters pulse ox monitor. The velcro makes it nice so we can get bigger items in and secure them close to the stroller handle bar.
Baby,3.0,Three stars,Cute but I got a different wubbanub as a gift and the other one was higher quality. This was seemed cheap. But it's ok
Baby,5.0,One of the best baby jumping toys out there,One of the best baby jumping toys out there.  Our child loves this thing and can go up to an hour in it without fussing.  Its well made and looks nice.  It was easy to pull the seat out to clean when she dropped a bomb in it one time.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,GIFT
Baby,5.0,great,"it arrived on time and in good condtion. my 3 mounth loves this toy i hang it on his carseat and he plays with it, makes car rides a bit better since he hates to be in his carseat."
Baby,5.0,Granddaughter loves it!,"Can't rave enough about this jumper.  My granddaughter absolutely loves it.  She has had it for about six months now, we have raised it once, and she still jumps like a wild woman and laughs the whole time!  I looked at all the jumpers, and this one is worth every penny!"
Baby,4.0,good,"Small, but very useful!!"
Baby,5.0,Great quality and price!,I was concerned that for the price this would be cheap and flimsy but WOW! It's a well made piece. Fits great on my Jeep stroller and the cup holders are flexible enough to fit our odd sized Disney cups in them but snug enough to keep them secure.
Baby,5.0,Awesome product!,My daughter absolutely loves this jumper. There is so much to stimulate her and keep her busy. It has been a huge help for her and me!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,my daughter love its!
Baby,5.0,My only compliant is it seems like it has a 3-6 month soothie on it and ...,"My daughter loves her Wubba!!! It has helped her with her hand and eye coordination.  She learned how to hold it, which then helped her learn how to hold regular binkies.  My only compliant is it seems like it has a 3-6 month soothie on it and not a 0-3.  It's a little large and hard for my infant daughter, she gagged at first."
Baby,5.0,Great Paci & Cute!,Cutest!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,excelente producto recomendado
Baby,1.0,Cannot  use as described,These don't even fit the babies ankles and noooo....I do not have a chunky baby. She was preemie size and just hitting 10lbs and skinny as can be. Useless for me...
Baby,5.0,The Perfect Jumperoo,"This is the only jumperoo/ exersaucer that my 5 month old will even PUT UP WITH. Any other thing I have put him in he hates, and fusses until I take him out. He will jump for an hour or so happily in this Toy. He can reach the little toys in front of him and easily see the lights. The volume settings are perfect, and has two music options. He enjoys the little bird and frog hanging above him, and eats the butterfly on the side. Its crazy how happy he is and is a giant stress relief to us to have found the perfect Jumperoo."
Baby,2.0,Hope you have an I-Device!,"I was not aware until I contacted customer support that Android Lollipop (latest Android) is flat out not supported.  They said to use the less-featured website.  I figured out a way to get the app installed anyhow (as I mess with rooting my phone) and it's on version 1.08.  The I-device app is past version 2.0!  The instructions in the box are all written for I-devices.  There was a little insert for Android installation instructions, which read, &#34;Download the app, then follow the on screen instructions&#34;.  How can I do that if you discontinued the Android app back in 2013!?!? Very frustrating!  If you have an I-device, you'll be fine.  If you have Android only devices, as I do, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I have to say, other than touching the microphone button to be able to talk back to your baby (which crashes the app for me every time) it seems to work perfectly.  I'm not sure why they say the app is not compatible with Lollipop.  Just take out the mic button, call it 1.09, and everything else works flawlessly.  There does seem to be a bit of a delay, but its not more than 10 seconds, which is acceptable considering it's streaming video."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Nice!
Baby,5.0,So entertaining!,Next best thing to seeing babies walk.. Seeing them jump!!
Baby,1.0,One Star,Small not much room

Baby,5.0,Fun!,My little one loves this jumperoo!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,These things are awesome!  My LO loves his WubbaNubs!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,it is nice...but thought it had more nature sounds....very cute..
Baby,5.0,WubbaNub Brown Monkey Review,My son loves &#34;his monkey&#34; and won't sleep without it. This is the second purchased.
Baby,2.0,Not baby friendly,"Bought this for our 6 month granddaughter--hoping she might be entertained while the family enjoyed dinner.  She hated it--primarily because she couldn't put anything in her mouth.  She couldn't reach over to get near the objects.  As babies put everything in their mouths until 9-12 months, this is a big deficiency.  Maybe she will like it when she is older."
Baby,5.0,Could not have been more awesome!!!,"When I was thinking of buying this accessory for my child's stroller, one of my priority was will my coffee cup or drink bottle stay upright and not fall even if I'm in a hurry and running! Well, it did...almost whatever bottle or cup we put it stayed...and we were a week in Florida with heat and running from one ride to another in the different parks- it stayed awesome!!! I will really recommend this product!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Nice sized learning toy.  Lots of pieces for baby to play with.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fits great with my britax be safe stroller. Great price. Great amount of space for my belongings.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,So cute. Baby loves it.
Baby,5.0,Entertaining and Durable,"I purchased this two years ago for my first son and he loved it, now my second son is enjoying it as well.  Simple design and right amount of toys.  It has continued to work perfectly, no problems at all.  I definitely recommend this jumper, it has been entertaining watching my boys get some jumping exercise!"
Baby,5.0,Great for my baby!,"We have the dino version of this and my son loves it so we thought we'd get one more of a different style. These are good because it's a pacifier and a plush all in one.  During the night if he wakes up its easy for him to find in the dark and grab onto to put back in his mouth and go right back to sleep. Worth it's weight in gold to a sleep deprived parent!<br />Note: It's Machine washable, air dry."
Baby,5.0,Our child loves this,Our child loves this. Easy to put together and portable.
Baby,5.0,but the fun he is having out weighs this complaint,"My little grandson loves this bouncer. It did not take him long at all to figure out that he could jump! My only complaint is that it does not fold up very well for storage, but the fun he is having out weighs this complaint."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love love love this jungle themed jumperoo
Baby,2.0,Not great.,The rattles don't make a lot of sound. In fact one of the two isn't a rattle but makes a crunching sound. Perhaps it's better for older babies.
Baby,5.0,She loves it!,She loves it and we love it too. Very entertaining.
Baby,5.0,Favorite,My babies favorite wubbanub!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it
Baby,3.0,Nice Product,"Nice product, easy to assemble and works well with baby. Received product in perfect condition and very fast shipping."
Baby,5.0,Great universal organizer,"Love the simplicity and utility of this organizer. Our stroller doesn't have a parent tray and I often find myself in need of a place to put my drink, keys, phone etc.  This is a fabric organizer that uses hook and loop straps to attach to most stroller handles.  There is a mesh pocket inside with a zipper where I usually store my keys and drink holders on each side of the organizer.  They hold bottled water, larger cups and sippy cups. If not holding drinks I find the cup holders are a great place to easily access my phone. My favorite thing about them is that they are not hard plastic and can be flexible to whatever you are storing.  I love the price on this organizer and again that I can use it with just about any stroller. I use one on my everyday stroller as well as on my jogger."
Baby,5.0,Love it!,Baby loves this thing! Very entertained for longer periods of time compared to other items.
Baby,5.0,Favorite toy,One of my 4 month old daughters favorite toys.
Baby,5.0,got to have at least 1,So cute easy for baby to grab & find on his own

Baby,5.0,life saver,LOVE BEST EVER!!! MADE MY BABY SO HAPPY!! Let me and my hubby relax and watch a movie with her by our side in the jumper
Baby,4.0,"One works, the other not so much","Update: Well, two months after I wrote my initial review the second one (which was the one with the problems) finally died.  Wouldn't boot up any more.  It was still under warranty so I e-mailed Withings fully expecting to hear nothing back.  To my surprise, I got an e-mail back the next day.  After answering some questions for customer support over a few days via e-mail, they decided to send me a new unit!  So about 2 weeks after I contacted them, I had a new baby monitor.  I have to respect a company that honors their warranty even for a discontinued product.  The new one is working great so far (knock on wood). I bumped up my review to 4 stars based on this, and the fact that as I think about it, there still really isn't a product like this out there in the market.  Sure, you can get a little IP cam for less money that mostly does the same thing, but I have tried a couple of those and to be honest the phone interface is not as reliable and nicely executed as the Withings interface.  I am really glad I bought these as they have served me relatively well for 3 babies... I would certainly buy another Withings product in the future as I think they really are pretty innovative.  Original (2-star) Review: This product must have a serious issue with quality control.  I have two of these - one works perfectly, the other is plagued with problems. I bought the first one in 2012 when they were still $300 and it worked (and still does work) perfectly.  I bought a second one 9 months ago (for $250) because we had twins, and something is wrong with the camera lens.  It is like misaligned or something - because the video towards one edge is very distorted.  Also, it frequently loses sound, or the sound randomly becomes very faint, or sometimes I just have to go reset it completely.  Resetting is very tricky - it is some sequence of plugging/unplugging the battery and /or power cord in some order that never works the same way twice... A bit frustrating.  I gave it two stars because one works great (which is why I bought the second one), but the second one has been a disappointment. Also, like others, I never really used the lullaby or light features.  However, one of our twins likes the lullaby music, and it has actually worked to put her back to sleep - a priceless feature if it can do that!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son loves these!
Baby,5.0,Best jumperoo!,We bought this jumperoo for our 4 month old. He loves all of the toys and the ability to turn (with his brothers help!) to play with the other toys! He is 26 inches tall and able to jump on his own on the lowest setting.  The lights and music really keep his attention and he loves the fact that he can start the music by himself. It took about 15 minutes to set up and the seat cover washes really well. This is the best jumperoo available in my opinion!
Baby,5.0,George the Giraffe,"George is a good guy. Not only is he fun for our son to grab, but he also indulges his vanity."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love this! Easy to put together, easy on adjustments..baby girl loves it..keeps her entertained! Definitely worth buying!!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Kids love
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Not much sound from the rattles
Baby,5.0,I love this way more than what I paid for it,"It's kind of hard to believe how much I like this considering how little I paid for it. This is a great addition to my UppaBaby Vista stroller. I had looked at the one designed specifically for the Vista, and it was rated poorly. An acquaintance recommended this, and I'm so pleased. The best part is that when we travel and take our UppaBaby G-Lite, I can use it on that stroller too!"
Baby,5.0,Great product!,Fits perfectly! I have two different types of strollers and this fits on both. It's nice sturdy fabric. Easy to attach. Durable and expensive looking.<br />So glad I bought this! Highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My niece love this product.  The quality is great and I love how versatile it is.
Baby,5.0,"Quality, good price","I bought this for my City Micro stroller (almost identical to City Mini). It fits perfectly and suits my needs well. It is roomy enough for us, able to hold four drinks for our family if needed. Any drinks we put in the two insulated drink holes don't sweat all over what is in the center part. It is also plenty deep. I use a tall glass water bottle, and it stays upright and held tight. No drink has ever fallen out of this. The zippered pouch is a nice touch though I don't use it often. It gets used on a regular basis, and the velcro has stayed tight and strong, no shifting or coming loose. A couple of my friends have other brands, and they both like mine better. It is deeper, roomier, and the velcro stays put. It is well-made for a very good price. Highly recommend."
Baby,4.0,"Cute plate, but a little harder to wash compare ...","Cute plate, but a little harder to wash compare to those straightforward square or round shaped plates that my little one used to have."
Baby,5.0,Happy with this purchase!,This holder was perfect for the stroller! The stroller only comes with a small cup holder so having more room for whatever was so helpful.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This has been a great product! It is durable and my wipes have stayed wet.
Baby,5.0,The child who got this absolutely loves it. Its ...,"The child who got this absolutely loves it. Its very well made. The pacifier end is secured to the animal, so not afraid of it coming undone."
Baby,4.0,Great walker to get baby on the move,This walker has a nice size tray that you can also put other toys for the child to play with when they are not walking around. I provide day care for my granddaughter and this walker is a life saver.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,:)
Baby,5.0,Very handy!,The baby jogger I bought second hand didn't have any place to put a water bottle or other beverage when we went out. This organizer can hold two beverages and has room for other items besides. It seems well-made. Very pleased with the purchase and may have to get a second one for the other stroller.
Baby,5.0,It is his favorite place to sit besides our laps,Our son loves this bouncy seat.  It is his favorite place to sit besides our laps.  The toys keep him occupied and likes to sit in it all the time.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very nice useful organizer!
Baby,2.0,because the red lid slides open easily.,"The wipes dry out in a day or so (California buyer), because the red lid slides open easily."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,I wish it had some kind of cover for when it rains but other than that is works great
Baby,5.0,Fun for a 5 month old who doesn't bounce yet,"At 5 months, my baby doesn't jump yet so this is still strictly an activity station.<br /><br />The first thing she liked was the butterfly because she can pull it up and chew on it. Then it was the lizard which she turns with her fingers. Third was animals hanging, she would lean back and stare at them and try to reach for them but are too far. It was only after a week where she started getting interested at the toys that has lights and sounds (I rarely turn it on because she seems overwhelmed by it).<br /><br />She's at least 2 feet tall, and we're at the lowest setting. We placed a pillow underneath so her feet wouldn't dangle.<br /><br />On the first week we let her play there for 5 minutes daily. Then on the second week, 5 minutes at a time; around 2-3 times a day. Now she's familiar and can last 10-15 minutes at a time.<br /><br />We still minimize the time she spends on it because we read online that tummy time (which she absolutely hates) should take precedence."
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Says it is made in the USA but it is made in China.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Exelent
Baby,5.0,It was easy to assemble and great quality,My four month old loves this jumper!  He was a little short for it at first...we had to put a little pad under him so he could reach.  But he quickly grew into it...and has been bouncing ever since.  It was easy to assemble and great quality!  Love it!
Baby,5.0,Great product,Love this toy and so do my daycare kids- great value and is holding up amazingly considering it's frequent use.
Baby,5.0,Very easy and functional,Very easy and functional. My Mamas and Papas stroller does not have cup holders and they are pricey to buy. This Organizer helps with holding my water bottle and baby's  sippy cup. I can fold my stroller no problem with no need to take this baggy off. Great functional buy for the money!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Worth every penny.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My little guy loves this!! Really teaches him how to hold it in his mouth
Baby,5.0,The lights and music are a plus but he can enjoy it without that turned on,Purchased for my 6 month old and he loves it. The lights and music are a plus but he can enjoy it without that turned on.
Baby,5.0,I am absolutely in love with this jumper as much as my son is,I am absolutely in love with this jumper as much as my son is. He will sit in it and jump for hours. All the toys on it keep him entertained and he will turn in the seat to play with all of them. He never gets bored of it. It is definitely so helpful when he is fussy and doesn't want to do anything else. The music plays while he jumps and he loves that. The bird and the frog that hang from the poles are also a big hit with him. He will reach up and try to grab them all the time.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,great accessory! also its half the price as other products.
Baby,3.0,Smaller,
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My niece loves it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great activity for my baby who loves to jump.
Baby,5.0,more than worth the buy!!,"The monkey wubbanub is perfect!! Can't wait till my 11/2 month son starts grasping things this for sure will be a hit. Im tired of losing his pacifiers, this was worth the buy!<br />UPDATE: We eventually lost this pacifier in the parking lot of clackamas  OR Costco and I tell you, whoever finds this lil guy will be a happy camper. I am really sad he's gone! My 4 month old has a duck, penguin, and elephant in his wubbanub entourage but the monkey was definitely one of his favorite as the body is longer and has more substance for support when laying him to sleep on his side. These make for great baby shower gifts and hold up really well in the washer, to my surprise."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My child can stay in this for hours. He loves jumping!
Baby,4.0,RAVE,Absolutely Love This!! Super simple to assemble I put it togther with no instructions. Does take up a bit of space but she loves it. Would recommend this for a friend.
Baby,5.0,My little jumper can't get enough of this jumper,"Our baby bounces in the morning, afternoon and night and has used this since he was about 5 months (now 8 months). As with every new toy and gadget there's a warm up period. Once he concluded he liked it we couldn't get him out of it--which means mommy gets time to eat and do some stuff around the house!"
Baby,5.0,Great price & very useful!,"Perfect for my Combi Twin stroller, which did not come with a cup holder. Now I have a place to store my items...drinks, cell phone, etc."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very best
Baby,5.0,... this for my grandson and it has been the best purchase I have made,I bought this for my grandson and it has been the best purchase I have made.  He will spend quite a bit of time bouncing and laughing . I would recommend this product for any one.  We found it so much safer than the one that goes in the door jam and with all the toys and sounds he has  a great time.
Baby,5.0,We love our Jumperoo!,"My daughter is 12 months old and loves her Jumperoo! This is such a great deal, We haven't put batteries in it since we purchased it and she still enjoys it. I recommend this to anyone with an infant."
Baby,5.0,Baby loves more than any other activity,Great my grandson has the time of his life in it. The springs are protected by a thin piece of cloth only wish is had little better protection there other than that it's perfect.
Baby,1.0,Do not buy this unless you like added stress in your life.,"This thing was only OK, should have bought a real baby monitor and not and internet enabled one.  It would often just drop connection from time to time for no apparent reason, often when it was supposed to be working monitoring our children, which would require a complete reset to get it working.  It actually started working pretty well for the last year, but then last night it gave up the ghost.  Stopped working completely.  I reset it etc today and no joy.  Looks like it entered some test loop because every time I pushed the reset button the camera would move in a complete circuit (something it never did before).  It is so nice to have a baby monitor to tell you if the kids are sleeping, etc, would be even nicer if it could last more than 2 and a half years.  Even some of the Infrared LED's were burning out.  Do not buy this unless you like added stress from poor electronics.<br /><br />Things like this should just work, and work for several years.  Hopefully the newer iBaby cameras work better, but we won't buy one."
Baby,5.0,LOVE this. I can tell my son to go ...,"LOVE this.<br />I can tell my son to go back to sleep when he wakes too early, sing him a song, play him a song, or turn on a night light for him. Its difficult to position the camera optimally, and I don't know what the included holder was meant to fit on."
Baby,5.0,She fell asleep with out mommy,I love this just as much as my five month old does. I started putting her in it at four months with a swaddle behind her so she had a little support. I don't have to wear her anymore to do chores around the house (she's 18lbs now) thank heaven lol
Baby,5.0,"Baby loves it, anchors binky well",My baby loves these. And the monkey shape works the best with its longer curved forearms.
Baby,5.0,Holds all your mom stuffs,"Fits my stroller perfectly. I have the Summer Infant 2014 3D Lite Convenience Stroller, Hibiscus Pink (which I love btw). Works well. Cheap but great quality. Definitely recommend."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good!
Baby,1.0,Save your $200,So could have done without this! My husband is a tec junky and insisted on getting this! It's not worth all the money! The video is choppy and it disconnects all the time! I just use my iPad and iPhone to watch n talk to my baby!!!  To top off my frustration about the price I later saw it at TJMaxx for $50 I wanted to cry!!!!!!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,love this product.. we use it in our chicco stroller!
Baby,4.0,My husband and I wanted a cup holder for the stroller but were hesitant to buy anything because nothing looked sturdy enough to,"Can't believe I waited over a year to buy this. My husband and I wanted a cup holder for the stroller but were hesitant to buy anything because nothing looked sturdy enough to hold hot coffee while strolling over rough terrain, i.e., terrible city sidewalks. This works well - only a couple of minor spills (only enough to get the bottom of this thing damp), easy to wipe clean, doesn't get in the way when folding the stroller."
Baby,5.0,Lifesaver,This jumper has been put through the ringer. Our son has used it everyday since he turned 4 months old. At 20 pounds I just moved it to the second notch and he can still get his feet flat on the floor. He looks forward to when we clean or make dinner and gets to jump to his hearts content.
Baby,2.0,"Would have been great, but...","Would have been awesome if the music / light panel worked. Unfortunately, it didn't. Fisher Price, fix your Quality Control."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Ordered for my grandson and he loves it.
Baby,5.0,I was very concerned to buy as I as in debate to get the baby Einstein one however I am very happy with! It plays music,"My son loves it! I bought it for him at 4 months and he loves it! I was very concerned to buy as I as in debate to get the baby Einstein one however I am very happy with! It plays music, turns 360, jumps great! Easy to assemble and lots of toys keeps him busy for a long time and I highly recommend"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My niece loved it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love this!!! Very soft and durable.
Baby,5.0,Best One out there!!,Love it! So happy I purchased this one after hours of researching all others!
Baby,5.0,Perfect for someone who has to ride in a car seat facing backwards.,"Our kid LOVES this.  Whether it's batting the dangly things around or hugging it and trying to eat the giraffe's face when we take it off the handle and let him hold it, it always keeps his attention."
Baby,3.0,Good for the price,"This is a nice walker, good quality.She likes the toys. This does not roll well at all on carpet but works great on our hardwood floors."
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Broke very easily. Using duck tape to keep side together
Baby,3.0,Not great for younger babies.,It's cute but actually makes it easier for my son to loose his pacifier. He grabs onto the monkey and pulls it out all the time (hes 3 months). May work better once hes older and can use it to hold onto. We will see.
Baby,4.0,their customer service was quick to respond to my email and gave me good answers.,"The creators of this product obviously don't speak English as a first language. Their translation into English leaves a bit to be desired. It's definitely not plug and play, as it may suggest. I had to learn how to Foward my Wifi Port, among other networking things just to be able to use this. However, their customer service was quick to respond to my email and gave me good answers."
Baby,5.0,my son's favorite toy,got this for my baby boy and he really  loves to play with this! this toy assures the safety of your baby's weak legs because of the durable and thick garter in the sides. great toy indeed!
Baby,5.0,Works with bob,Worked great on our bob and folds nicely with the stroller. Great quality.
Baby,5.0,Perfect for baby!,"This product is adorable.  My 3 month old preemie is just mastering his grasping and holding skills and he can grab onto this easily.  It's very lightweight and soft.  As others have noted the pacifier is permanently attached, but if wasn't we'd likely end up losing it, especially if baby learned to pull them apart.  We bought one WubbaNub to test it out and will be ordering at least one more given we (esp our son) like it so much."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Exactly what I expected.
Baby,5.0,This worked great! Because he can hold onto it he will ...,Bought this for my 4 month old son who I couldn't get to take a binkie. This worked great! Because he can hold onto it he will keep it in his mouth and he will also chew on the monkey too! It's great !
Baby,5.0,Must have!,"Love this caddy. Straps easily to the handle of my stroller, and has 2 separate pockets on each end for cups or bottles, and one center section for keys, phone, etc. Really, really handy, now I don't have to carry everything in my pockets!"
Baby,5.0,Nice jumper for the price,"Baby loves this jumper. Just wish it was a bit lower on lowest setting so Jaynie can reach her feet to the floor, but we put down a platform and she can now reach and move around. She is 3 months old. This one is better than others we tried as it takes little effort to get her moving."
Baby,5.0,Hours of fun,Perfect! Just what every baby needs! Provides lots of fun and leg strengthening. Granddaughter loves it!
Baby,3.0,Great product.,It's good for the price.
Baby,5.0,My son loved it!,thank you! My son loved it!
Baby,4.0,Satisfied.,Baby enjoys it.  But it doesn't seem too sturdy when she does big jumps.

Baby,5.0,My son loved this. He still loved it at 15 months ...,My son loved this. He still loved it at 15 months but we finally put it away because we stopped using it as a jumper and he would just stand and play from the outside.
Baby,5.0,if you use this kind of pacifier then you NEED a wubbanub!!,I received this as a gift for my baby shower and this was the best pacifier i could have been given! my son absolutely loved his monkey wubbanub!!<br />I loved that at a VERY young age he could hold the money and find the pacifier all on his own as well as give him something to cuddle.<br />I loved that having the monkey attached I was able to find it in my diaper bag super easy.<br />It is also very convienent that if it falls on the floor the stuffed animal keeps the pacifier off of the floor 95% of the time.<br />This was also very handy for when we quit the pacifier. I was able to just cut off the pacifier part and my son would still have his monkey to cuddle and love to sooth him instead of the actual pacifier.<br />If this is the type of pacifier your child takes then you NEED a wunnanub now!
Baby,5.0,It's so flexible the slightly move makes him jump which is why it's so great. Highly recommended,My baby loves his jumper. It's so flexible the slightly move makes him jump which is why it's so great. Highly recommended!

Baby,4.0,baby loves it!,"Oh my gosh, baby LOVES this! The only drawback is that the pacifier does not detach from the stuffy.  I would much rather it be two separate pieces so that I could sanitize the paci, but all in all its still a good product."
Baby,5.0,We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my ...,We love all our wubbanubs - we throw 4 in my 8 month old's crib every night so he can find them when he needs them. He learned to put them back in his mouth himself before he could put a regular pacifier in.
Baby,5.0,Cute baby toy!,Delivered on time and toy is exactly as described.
Baby,5.0,"my baby love it, so I have to love it","my 7 month old just love jumping inside. No one ever taught him how to play, he figured out all by himself, and he love jumping with the music. Dont be cheap, put the battery in and turn on the music, kids love it."

Baby,5.0,Fun,My some loves this jumparoo. He loves the lights and noises and jumping around. Now I have a place to put him where he has fun and I know he's safe while I do chores.
Baby,5.0,Great buy!,"This was a fabulous buy! We got it for our 4 month old son and he loves it. It's great entertainment for both him and us. The only &#34;con&#34; I guess is that it's hard to break down. But, it does fold up into a relatively small space. Overall, we were very pleased!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Liked it so much we bought it twice
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This is my number one recommendation for new moms.
Baby,5.0,Great jumperoo,This was prices so well when I bought it! Cheaper than target an walmart! My little boy loved it! It is well built and super cute. I can see it lasting for years.
Baby,5.0,Life saver!!,"The WubbaNub is amazing! My newborn kept accidentally spitting his pacifier out and it was a constant battle to keep him asleep. With this, it stays in place and once he gets older, he'll love the animal."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,these are perfect to my dougther!! i love it.
Baby,5.0,Great fit!,Great fit on our Kelty jogger stroller! Very satisfied with the price too.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My eight months old loves this toy.
Baby,4.0,Love it.,Awesome caddy...just wish the straps were a tad longer... good thing they are velcro and easy to extend.
Baby,5.0,Great Product,"Lots of activities for baby, easy to assemble, reasonably priced... win win win.  IT does takes up a lot of space, but obviously sturdiness (pretty much impossible to tip it over) is important."
Baby,5.0,Love our WubbaNub!!!,"Our 6 month old LOVES this pacifier. It is easy for him to hold and get back in his mouth. It is easy for me to hold onto it when we are out and about, too, so it doesn't fall on the floor. The plush is soft and nice. I wash mine in the washing machine inside a lingerie bag. These make a wonderful gift!!"
Baby,4.0,Cute accessories,"Baby seems uninterested, but she is only 3.5 months. We'll see about later. They are really cute though!"
Baby,5.0,Good investment,Baby loves his WubbaNub. The soothie binkies are his favorite type of pacifier and he loves holding the monkey as well.
Baby,5.0,A must have,Never gets old. My son loves this jumper
Baby,5.0,Great for everyday use,"I've been using this stroller organizer for a couple of months and love it!  Perfect size, not bulky, and holds two drinks.  I have a city micro stroller which doesn't have cup holders so that was a big plus.  Also, I like to keep by phone and wallet close to me while at the mall and the storage area is the perfect size."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,I love it!!!!!
Baby,1.0,What insane product manager actually released this?,"We are very, very conflicted about this.  When this device works, it's really wonderful: we can check in over the internet, and I have successfully sang my baby back to sleep even from my office!  Amazing!<br /><br />But here's the thing: you want to know when your baby wakes up and starts crying in the night, right?  Seems like a pretty normal, obvious, important thing for a baby monitor to do, right? Maybe even a *requirement* for a baby monitor?<br /><br />The Withings Smart Baby Monitor will not stay connected to your wifi network.  It will disconnect, and it *might* tell you that it disconnected, but it won't automatically reconnect.<br /><br />If I had the power, I would fire every single one of the product team over this one, ludicrously stupid failure.  This is like a 2-lines-of-code fix: JUST MAKE THE DAMN THING AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT.  When it disconnects and we happen to see it, we can just hit the button again and it reconnects.  HOW ABOUT DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY?  Imagine!  What an idea!  Now, it *says* it *tried* to reconnect, but couldn't, and yet: I can make it reconnect just by hitting the switch again.  SO HOW ABOUT DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY?  Please, please, please just put it in a while() loop. I would happily do it for you.  PLEASE.<br /><br />I DREAM of confronting the people at this company: Do you people have brain damage? How did you all get engineering and product management jobs in the first place? Can I just sit down and fix your code FOR YOU?  What mentally disabling drugs did you take to make you release a product so fundamentally, basically flawed that has such a simple solution? Is this company some kind of charity that employs engineers that couldn't get hired anywhere else?  If I interviewed someone who worked on this product I'd beg them to explain, if I didn't order them out of the room immediately.<br /><br />So, if you're listening at all to your customers, Withings, please hear me: JUST MAKE THE APP AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT.  IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD.  I almost (not actually) wish there would be an accident just so someone could sue this insane company into fixing their product, and refund everyone's money."
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Colors were great but they ran super small. My 12 week old couldn't fit them.
Baby,5.0,Very good,exactly what the picture shows.  Very good quality
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,this was a gift for my granddaughter.  from what my  daughter tells me is that  she likes it
Baby,5.0,Does the job,Works great with my city mini double stroller so just ordered another for the other side.
Baby,5.0,Grandson loves it!,Great purchase!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Item as described. Quick shipping.
Baby,5.0,Great,My daugther loves it
Baby,5.0,Favorite toy,My baby loves it... He's still too young to jump in it at four months old but it is his favorite toy so far... Not too difficult to assemble and was shipped fast...
Baby,5.0,He gets the best sleep ever after jump for awhile,My son loves this jumper. He gets the best sleep ever after jump for awhile.
Baby,5.0,Great activity centre,"Great activity centre. I bought this for my 4 month old baby. Ensure that your baby has soft shoes on, so that when he/she jumps it's not hard on his/her feet that can result in a broken toe. But overall, great buy."
Baby,5.0,Well worth it!,"I had the same one for my first son who absolutely loved it. Five years later, my second son loves it as well. He loves it more than the first one I bought, which is the space saver from bright stars.<br />I'm glad I bought this. Going to return the bright stars jumperoo."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Two children have LOVED this device. Catchy tune (not annoying). Great service from Fisher-Price.
Baby,5.0,This is the bouncer you want!,Love this Bouncer. My son got this when he was 3 months and now he is 9 months and never gets tired of jumping!!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Our Grandson Loves this.
Baby,5.0,Love it,Our child loves his jumperoo. Gives him so much joy.
Baby,5.0,Loooove it!!,It is so comfortable. Has 2 pockets for bottles and a little pocket with a zipper. Love it.
Baby,5.0,great for cars,"So glad i received the wubbanub money paci in our buy buy baby registry gift bag!<br />This is great for baby's that dont quite yet have a strong enough suction to keep the paci in their mouth so the eight of the money keeps the paci by their mouth so they can easily get it again.<br />They're cute<br />Easy to Clean 3 ways<br />Either wipe down, run paci under water but hold animal part up or just wash the whole thing which shouldn't be an issue since its not fluff inside. There's lots of cute animals just wish there was a fox as ive now passed my 2yros monkey down to my newest who we're doing foxes theme for. This was a brilliant idea to make!! Wubbanubs for the win in the car exspecially!!"
Baby,5.0,it holds things just fine. I usually put a coffee or a water ...,"Bought this for my Baby Jogger Mini stroller. It fits, it holds things just fine. I usually put a coffee or a water bottle in the cup holder without issues. But I use the stroller for casual walking/shopping, not actual jogging, so I cant testify to the cup holders stability if you use it for a coffee cup while jogging. The price is right, and worth getting to have cup storage for your Mini."
Baby,4.0,Got for a gift,I bought this as a gift to my sister for her new child. It might not be needed yet but it is goof to have
Baby,5.0,FANTASTIC TOY,"This is our daughter's favorite toy.  She will easily spend 20 minutes jumping.  Like some other reviewers said she will jump herself to sleep in it.  We started her out in it at three months and put mats under so she could reach. Now at 7 months she is at the level two height.  She loves that it makes noise and lights up.  She does not move around in circles with it yet.  It is nice that it folds up but we don't use that feature much.  There really isn't many cons to it, maybe that it takes up a lot of space and defiantly dominates a room."
Baby,5.0,Best jumping device and it tuckers him out,Bought this for my 4.5 month old - he wasn't tall enough so we would put a pillow under his feet so he could jump. He's now 6 months old and LOVES to jump in this thing. Easier then the Johnny Jump Up because we can cart this around the house and not need a door frame. Best jumping device and it tuckers him out!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,fun for the baby
Baby,5.0,Must have,Best invention EVER!!!!! My 5 month old can jump for a hour straight and it so entertained with all the music and toys! Gives mommy and daddy time to eat and clean haha. Love that it's light enough to switch rooms so can keep an eye on my baby.
Baby,3.0,My baby loves this but it is the WORST design to adjust the height,My baby loves this but it is the WORST design to adjust the height. I would never recommend this based on its terrible design for adjustment. Unbelievably frustrating.
Baby,5.0,This thing is AWESOME! I rarely write reviews,"This thing is AWESOME! I rarely write reviews, but as I sit here and watch my 3 month old baby girl scream with glee, I thought 'why not?'. I did a TON of research on walkers vs bouncers and all the models of both. This one was a great choice!! There is action and stimulation at every turn- the hanging animals are a hit when she looks up in awe. The music changes so you're not hearing the same thing over and over, and its really bouncy. Her toes barely touch and its still enough to make her bounce a lot! She loves it, and happy baby = happy mommy"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter has been laughing since her father put it together. She loves it
Baby,5.0,One of the most convenient items I've purchased for the ...,"One of the most convenient items I've purchased for the stroller. When I take it off the stroller, it works as a car organizer too!"
Baby,5.0,Excellent Jumperoo to start out your 4 month old in,"Excellent Jumperoo to start out your 4 month old in, helping them gain control with his neck and back and pushing off with their legs. Start a little at a time. My grandson loved it and all the things on Jumperoo to grab."
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,Perfect! Couldn't be happier with my purchase. Adjustable straps mean it'll work with probably any stroller. I have an Urbini and it's wonderful!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Very good product
Baby,3.0,She loves it !!!,Bought this as a gift for my God daughter and she absolutely loves it. Well made and sturdy.
Baby,5.0,Fisher Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This has been a delightful learning activity for my grandson!  I'd recommend it to other parents!  I looked a several jumpers before I bought this one, and it didn't disappoint."
Baby,4.0,Good bouncer. 4 month old cant touch the ground ...,"Good bouncer. 4 month old cant touch the ground with flat feet, but she loves looking at all the colors and lights and hearing the music. as she gets bigger, I think she's really going to like this."
Baby,3.0,"I was expecting DD to jump for joy, but really she was kinda meh about it","I was expecting DD to jump for joy, but really she was kinda meh about it.  The worst part is getting her in it.  I thought it might get better with time as I knew how to use it, but it really has it.  Once we over the initial cry she is okay in for approx 14 minutes."
Baby,1.0,The most frustrating baby purchase we made.,"We thought this would be the best camera for us but it's been awful! My son was born spring of 2014 and since the first day he came home, the camera constantly turns off, won't reconnect and we spend most of the night trying to make it work! It's truly frustrating and we are in the market for a new one."
Baby,5.0,worth the money,I bought it to wear out my little one for bedtime and it worked.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,it is good
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby loves it!
Baby,5.0,Works great for 16lb baby girl - she loves it,"Works great for 16lb baby girl - she loves it, it captures her interest and has her bouncing and stretching."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Our little one loves this jumper...
Baby,5.0,Pretty good toys,"Pretty good toys, except for the elephant, which is useless. I like that the music can be set to play when baby bounces.<br />One big problem though with ours, the seat never loosened up in the track to turn back and forth, so the baby can't move it herself."
Baby,5.0,"Awesome bouncer, my son loves jumping in it","Awesome bouncer, my son loves jumping in it, hes almost 25 lbs though, wish it would hold a higher weight lol"
Baby,3.0,On the move....,bought this for my grandson and can't wait to watch him go...the ease of putting it together and the colorful design makes this a plus!!
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My baby loves this paci. It's her little friend
Baby,5.0,lots of fun activity,Gift for a friend's granddaughter. I bought it 2 months ago and she's just told me how much she still enjoys it.
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,"feels very cheap, doesn't worth the money, i've returned it."
Baby,5.0,Cute toy,My son loves this toy. It's perfect for traveling.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,My kid enjoys being in this Jumperoo
Baby,1.0,One Star,"My son isn't a fan of this item, but he might just need to grow into it."
Baby,3.0,Good product.,My Great Granddaughter loves this walker. She just turned 6 mos old and is trying to stand up already. The toys are where she can reach them and her eye/hand coordination is getting better.
Baby,4.0,Exactly what I needed.,Works well for our large umbrella folding stroller that doesn't have cup holders already and folds flat for traveling.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,bought as gift
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My two month old loves this.
Baby,5.0,This organizer is super convenient and will fit many different types of stroller,"This organizer is super convenient and will fit many different types of stroller. On my Bugaboo Buffalo it fits perfectly. I have Diono for a few months now, it looks like new and is a great value. Highly recommend!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,grand son loves this (7 months old)
Baby,1.0,This is a ripoff product.,"I gave this to my daughter and her husband in anticipation of our first grandchild. When we went to set it up last week, the power supply was missing. I purchased another and proceeded with the setup. Only after completing the setup per the instructions did the software tell me that my email address was not associated with this baby monitor. I did a hard reset of the monitor but the software still gave me the same error message. I contacted technical support with the issue and the MAC address of the unit. That was 2 days ago and still no support. This product is a rip-off and now per Amazon's return policy, I am stuck with it and am out over $200. Don't make the same mistake."
Baby,5.0,Never lose a binki again!,Love that we haven't lost this one yet!
Baby,1.0,Disappointing product,"Disappointed in this product; the design looked nice so we bought it without looking at reviews. As others mentioned, the red button pops off very easily AND the wipes (Earth's Best) dried out very quickly (within a day or two). The case itself felt a bit cheap as well. Much preferred the OXO brand dispenser."
Baby,5.0,Great jumper,My grandson loves this jumperoo.  I am so glad I read the reviews for this jumper.  I think the activities and music are the best to keep him interested and happy to use this jumper.  Definitely worth the money.
Baby,5.0,Really cute,"I love it but my daughter HATES it. I have to return it because she refuses to play in it. She used it 1x happily, she cries the rest of the time so it's a no go. She makes the rules for her toys. Lol! My niece loved hers though and that's why I bought this. Was gonna give it as a gift but they already got one."
Baby,5.0,I am sure my great-grandson will like it.,so cute....I am sure my great-grandson will like it.
Baby,5.0,Baby Had His First Laugh in the Jumperoo!,"Our son will be three months in less than a week and has good head control. We tried him in his brand jumperoo and he almost immediately discovered the animals on the branches over his head. He let out his FIRST laugh! Needless to say, awesome product!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Baby LOVES this!!!
Baby,2.0,Don't try to return it,"love the product but found it somewhere cheaper so decided to return it after putting it together. DO NOT attempt this. It was near impossible to fit it back into the box it came in. Completely inconvenient, disassembly of product is not realistic. Really unfortunate they make it so hard."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,works great!
Baby,4.0,"Great product, however speaking as an engineering professor","Great product, however speaking as an engineering professor,  the instructions are written in Chinese English and are exceedingly difficult to understand.  It would help allot if they used color photos and had the Chinese English instructions reviewed and corrected by an English speaker.  It makes me wonder what other corners Fisher-Price cut.  An easy fix for Fisher-Price if they even care.  All of that being said my 7 month old Fritz loves it!"
Baby,1.0,One Star,I have no idea
Baby,5.0,"But everything was there and looked perfectly fine, so we assembled it and it looks great","My 2 month old LOVES IT!!! He would rather be bouncing in this than laying in his swing or held by anyone. The packaging did come in a little messed up, and it was previously opened and then retaped shut. But everything was there and looked perfectly fine, so we assembled it and it looks great!"
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Good
Baby,5.0,This solved my issues and works awesome. The only thing I would suggest is taking ...,"I bought this after switching from a ful stroller to a Chico light weight. I was very spoiled to having cup holders and area to keep phone & keys. This solved my issues and works awesome. The only thing I would suggest is taking it off when storaging the stroller becuase I have noticed it has bent from bring attached and put into the trunk, but it is flexible and goes right back in place."
Baby,5.0,Great for the price,Our baby loves all the toys.  Great for the price.
Baby,5.0,Very fun and easy to clean,Have now used on 2 babies and still going strong. Very fun and easy to clean.
Baby,5.0,start of with this one,My sister told us to get this for our baby when he was around 8 months to keep him occupied in the crib when he doesn't want to sleep. He can now stand and turn it on by himself and it lasts 45 min! So far he can't reach the actual mobile yet (just the buttons) so we're leaving it up until he can reach those. My sister still has the music/nightlight box in the crib for her second baby. I wish I had taken her advice and started off with this one instead of the $55 mobile that you have to wind up and only lasts 5 min!
Baby,5.0,A+++,Great product
Baby,5.0,It is a great product and baby loves it,It is a great product and baby loves it.  Volume has two options and an off switch.  Lights and spinning seat!
Baby,5.0,Also works with Avent Natural bottles,"Very handy. Used these to help measure and mix formula for our little one who still needed it for a short time after she graduated to a sippy cup. Helped us shake and mix without having to wash out nipples later, so the seal was pretty good!"
Baby,5.0,Fantastic product and support,What a fabulous product that allows my hubby to view our son anywhere. Hubby works away weeks at a time and now he can just log onto app to watch our son. The service received from support was fabulous and went above and beyond to help me get it set up due to issues I was having with my router not the product. Very satisfied with this product so much so I brought 3 :-)
Baby,5.0,3 mo old loves these!! We have 3.,Daughter loves these! She can hang onto it at 3 mo. Doesn't spit it out as easily.
Baby,3.0,Good product but my baby hates it...,"I bought this product excited.. As I read the reviews, I expected my baby to love it. However, she doesn't like it at all. The seat is kind of small and tight, therefore is kind of difficult to insert baby. The toys and musical features are ok, but not enough to make my baby happy.. She won't stay on it more than five minutes, then starts crying. Also, consider takes it takes a lot of space.. Good product, but not for everybody.. Gave it three stars for this reason."
Baby,5.0,Good for storage,Fits my Avent Natural bottles. Great for storage. Plan to use them to transport breastmilk in a cooler on our next plane trip.
Baby,5.0,Best Baby Purchase So Far!!,"When my son was 4 months old I noticed he'd smile and laugh every time I'd let him stand on my lap. I decided to try a bouncer for him. The first few times we put him in it, he didn't know what to make of it and just kind of stood there. After about 10 minutes he'd want out. I thought maybe it wasn't for him. Then after a few tries, he just took to it. Once he saw he could jump on his own and noticed the different toys he could play with, he loved it. Now, he plays in it all the time!!! It allows me freedom to do things around the house while he enjoys jumping and playing. He's even fallen asleep in it because he's tired himself out. This is a must have for any child."
Baby,5.0,"Got this to keep my 9 month old, who ...","Got this to keep my 9 month old, who is crawling everywhere, entertained and safe. He loves it. Now I know where he is, he's strengthening his leg muscles and can hop along as his older brother dances to one of those dancing games."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,great for walkers too
Baby,4.0,would purchase again.,"Have enjoyed the wubbanub brown monkey. I like it better than just a plain binky because when it falls you can easily catch it or pick it up. A binky unattached with roll away or get lost in blankets, behind shoulder etc. It is also difficult to misplace because of the stuffed animal attached. I keep losing our other binky's but this one I have not lost yet.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is when I go to quickly rinse/wash binky in the sink it is difficult to not get the monkey wet as well. It would be nice if binky was detachable.<br /><br />Other than that I really like it and my son likes it too. He is able to easily grab onto it. It is also made well and has so far held up perfectly."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great product. My little one loves it!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,A must for every infant. It takes a beating and holds up perfectly
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son absolutely loves these! He has a giraffe and now his monkey :)
Baby,5.0,A crowd favorite,"Several of my mom friends recommended this jumperoo, and after trying out at least four different jumperoos and exersaucers at daycare, this is by far my son's favorite. According to the teachers in his room, it is the crowd favorite at day care as well. Additionally- the price on Amazon is usually considerably lower than other retailers!"
Baby,4.0,Amazing product!!,This walker is great for the price! Best walker in this price range you will find. My 5 month old daughter loves it she can walk around already.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Fun little hanging toy for tummy time gym.
Baby,5.0,great,baby loves
Baby,5.0,It has been a wonderful purchase. my grandson is 5 months old and ...,cannot say enough about this jumperoo.. It has been a wonderful purchase. my grandson is 5 months old and he loves it. the colors are vibrant and he loves the sounds it makes.
Baby,5.0,Best money spent!,"My daughter is 6 months and loves this jumper. She can't quite touch to jump yet, but loves the new freedom and toys!"
Baby,4.0,Seriously though-my baby loves it and bounces happily in it obviously she loves the bright colors and ...,I caved and bought an ugly baby toy. Seriously though-my baby loves it and bounces happily in it obviously she loves the bright colors and doodads spinning and bouncing all over the place.  Minus 1 star for being tacky looking. :P
Baby,1.0,Worthless.,"I am a customer of the IBaby Labs. I was given the baby monitor M3S as a Baby shower gift in March 2015 (order#5546).<br /><br />As expected, we did not try to use the camera until it was close to the due date, and soon thereafter. It took a lot of time for us to decide on which camera to get, and your had all the features we wanted.<br /><br />I write you today to express my discont with the product, the service provided and the overall experience. This is our last attempt to solve the issue directly with IBaby Labs. We will be contacting the Better Business Bureau, the Local TV station, post online and report to Apple and the credit card company.<br /><br />I would like a refund for the camera as soon as possible so my aunt can give me another one that works.<br /><br />I will list the events that got us here today.<br /><br />1.  Plug and Play: the camera was not as simple to set up, even though that was advertised. I do have all Apple products and took several calls to get it set up. The ‘sharing Wifi’ cycle never concluded. It took several calls to get it started; lots of install and reinstall trials.<br /><br />2.  Internet range: all other devices we have in the house (Ipad, Iphones, Apple TV, Sonos speaker, etc ) work within the wifi range we have with the Apple Router 802.11N (700 sq ft apartment). We were told that the area in which the camera sits has poor connection (through Ookla App suggested by your staff), even though we had already purchased another wifi signal booster that was placed 10 feet away from the camera (originally even hard wired).<br /><br />3.  Internet Connection: after lots of trouble shooting, we were told that the camera does not take 5GH, only 2.5GH. Why weren’t we told that during Support Call #1?<br /><br />4.  Lost Connection: despite all these efforts, we continued getting the ‘reconnecting/lost connection’ message 4 times within the same hour. It is important to mention that, as you know, the camera beeps loudly whenconnection is lost. Do you have kids? You then can imagine baby waking up every time connection is lost.<br /><br />5.  Live Feed: After troubleshooting all the above since mid March, I decided to give it a try with the live feed last month. Baby in crib in her room, camera on, I am away with the Ipad on live feed in my room, trying to sleep at the same time that I was trying the camera out. The Live Feed function has a static noise that prevents anyone from sleeping. Then, I found myself watching the monitor for the 20 minutes that this trial lasted. I kept looking for signals that the camera was indeed with live feed. I then realized that my baby was up, making sounds and moving around and the motion/sound alert had not detected it.<br /><br />All these issues were discussed with the support team. At times they would log the issue, at times they would not (#767, 4260, 4370, 4468). I have logs for my phone indicating at least 45 attempted/completed calls to the support line in the past 4 months. Have I mentioned that I am a new mom, with a newborn at home?<br /><br />Besides the technical issues that indicate that the camera is just not ready to be sold (as confirmed through other online reviews, and other friends experiences as well), we have an even bigger issue with the service provided. As the President and CEO I believe you would care to learn how this entire process has been so far.<br /><br />1.  Jennifer has been short, rude and dismissive every time we call. Never a smile on her voice.<br /><br />2.  Bricio, though very polite, repeats himself over and over again using the same words ‘let me be honest with you’, or ‘just out of curiosity’ but not offering any solutions.<br /><br />3.  Eva was put in the middle of all of this, helpless.<br /><br />4.  We have been trying to talk to a manager for 8 weeks now. None available, ever! No call back after Jennifer/Bricio guaranteed a follow up from management (except when Eva called back, clueless about what she was being involved on).<br /><br />5.  At some point, I was asked to record a video of the issue and submit to Bricio in order for the tech support to validate the problem and be able to send me a replacement camera (to which I would have to pay for shipping to return the defective one first – no trust here?). I recorded some of the video, but lacked memory on my phone to complete it. The email size was also too big and didn’t go through. I then sent an audio file with the static noise. I called the very next day, spoke to Bricio who listened to the audio file while with me on the phone. He then said that he had what he needed to proceed with the exchange. Two weeks went by without any update. I then called back, and he had a vague memory of my case, and tried again to get me to record the issue. I reminded him that I am the customer and I am working harder than they are to fix the problem. And for the record, I am the one with a newborn at home!!!<br /><br />6TToday was the last straw for us: when I asked Bricio to speak with the manager that was supposed to call me yesterday (and for the past many weeks), he politely said no manager was available. Then I asked for his/her name, and he declined sharing that. Then I asked for a phone number or email to that manager, and was declined again. Then I asked for the owner/President/CEO’s name, and he said he could not give me this information either.  Which company is that which prevents that information that is readily available online to be given out?<br /><br />The level of disregard for the complaint is beyond anything I have ever encountered. Very quickly Bricio and Jennifer mentioned the company’s return policy. Interestingly enough, at first when I mentioned I just wanted to return the camera bought through Amazon, they said I had to deal with Amazon. Had I bought directly with them, I could then get a refund. Well, when my aunt (Maria Blackmore) forwarded me the receipt, it showed that it was purchased directly from IBaby. Still, I was denied a refund. Though the policy applies, the mal functioning camera does not seem to be of concern to anyone at Ibaby Labs.<br /><br />I am writing you to make you aware of what is going on with your product and the service IBaby Labs provide. I can’t believe that for less than $200, there have been this many interactions without a solution.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you with the refund resolution. At this point, I have to kindly decline Bricio’s offer to send me a replacement.<br /><br />Thank you,"
Baby,5.0,This is a great product since a child can hold onto the animal ...,This is a great product since a child can hold onto the animal before being able to clutch a much smaller pacifier and keep it in its mouth. It is also great for mom and dad to keep track of.
Baby,3.0,Durable walker,Great walker if you're looking for a simple walker. Good price and durable
Baby,5.0,Good Product!,"Delivered on time, item was exactly as described and well made. Gives my 3 month old grand something soft to hold on to, keeping the pacifier in place longer."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 months loves it.
Baby,5.0,Highly recommended,I got this for my great-grandson because he was always in one at my daughter's (his grandmother's) house.  He just loves to bounce so it's perfect for him.  We call it his bouncy bouncy and he gets so excited!
Baby,1.0,Withings does not stand behind their product,"I purchased this item as part of my baby registry completion and did not use it consistently once I received it.  Instead, I waited until moving the baby to the nursery at 6 months old to really start using it.<br /><br />After less than 7 months of consistent use, the monitor completely stopped working.<br /><br />I contacted Withings via email (since that is the only way to contact them) and since I had purchased it over one year ago, it was considered out of warranty.  They said there was nothing they could do as it was a hardware failure and they offered me a 25% discount on the same product with no indication that the hardware issue was resolved with later versions.  I was shocked to learn that Withings doesn't even offer a repair service for this expensive monitor.<br /><br />If you choose to take your chances with this monitor:<br />1.  Be prepared for connectivity issues as reported in many other reviews (I experienced this problem off and on during the few months of use).<br />2.  Do not expect to be able to easily get in contact with Withings Customer Service.<br />3.  Start using it consistently as soon as you get it to flush out any issues within your first year for the warranty or be prepared to have a $200+ paperweight.<br /><br />In this day and age, with so many other options available, it appalls me that Withings did not attempt to do more to rectify the situation even though it was considered out of warranty.  I suppose that I've been spoiled by companies (like Amazon) with amazing Customer Service practices.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the [[ASIN:B00E1CIGAE Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode]] from Amazon as a fast replacement for this (it is not a video monitor) and have been way more satisfied with it's performance over the past few months than I ever was with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor."
Baby,3.0,My baby get's stuck in it????,"It get's the job done and my boys both seem to enjoy it. The problem is sometimes it puts them to sleep and their arms get STUCK (see picture). Hard to explain, but he wakes up screaming bloody murder which upsets me."
Baby,1.0,They really out to create something against battery spills.,broke after use also due to battery spill in the battery compartment.
Baby,5.0,Perfect!,"Wanted this for my Joovy caboose stroller and it works wonderfully to hold my cup, two sippy cups, my phone, keys and more. So glad I got this!"
Baby,5.0,Baby loved these rattles since she was born,"Baby loved these rattles since she was born, still likes playing with them and is 9 months - great baby gift!"
Baby,5.0,Great toy on multiple levels,"My 6 month old grandbaby loves it!  It's a great toy on so many levels.  Physically, it helps to develop leg and back strength.  The attached toys provide mental stimulation as well as hand/eye coordination.  Well worth the price!!"
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Poor in low lighting and poor with lights on. Never have firmware updates for monitor.
Baby,5.0,BEST PURCHASE IN A LONG TIME!,This Diono stroller organizer is PERFECT for our umbrella stroller. Shocked by how much it can actually hold!!!  And the price is UNBEATABLE! Works perfectly with our Maclaren umbrella stroller but also for our Baby Jogger City Select.
Baby,5.0,MUST HAVE!!!!,Awesome product that my son loves... Definitely his favorite toy...
Baby,5.0,This is the best little organizer for my G-Luxe stroller,This is the best little organizer for my G-Luxe stroller. It's a little flimsy but that's probably because I have to fold my stroller everyday. For the price it really can't be beat
Baby,5.0,Favorite toy,"This is my daughters favorite toy! I hung it over her pack n play around 2 months and she would bat at it. Now, at 4 months she grabs the rings and shakes the rattle really gets excited. We also take it down for her sometimes because she likes to hold it when we are sitting together. It's still in great shape."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Cute monkey
Baby,4.0,"Great Case, button could use some work...",Great Case. I used as a replacement for the one provided on the Jeep Diaper Backpack I ordered off of Amazon. It keeps the wipes moist for long periods. The only issue i have is that the slide button tends to pop off if you pull it outwards. But it pops right back on and doesnt affect the ability of the case to keep the moisture in the wipes so long as you keep the red button on the case. I would give it 5 stars if not for the button popping off
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great parent console for my city select stroller.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves this,"My LO has had this since he was 5 months old and still loves it at 9 months- even started to ask to go into it in his own ways! I wish I had gotten to this as soon as his head was stable at 2-3 months! There are two different sound levels for music which is great and music is either constant or activated by jumping.<br />Only negatives is that we needed to buy a pillow/folded blanket under his feet for awhile and then once he got tall enough, he liked to pull off the hanging animals. Still so worth it for the smiles and giggles he has when in this!"
Baby,4.0,I like the case,I like the case....but don't like that it not shut tight. But if you will use the wipes in one day from the time you put the wipes in then you got nothing to worry.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love this item, it was needed very much for my active granddaughter"
Baby,5.0,hours of fun,able to sit and enjoy my coffee for at least 10-20 minutes at a time. baby loves it. only thing is that its bulky and it just more stuff to add to your collection of stuff for baby! but totally worth it. :)
Baby,3.0,just OK,"the picture quality is terrible, like really bad. I feel like its gotten worse of the course of the 6 months that I've used it. you can barely make out my baby's head and legs when I check on him. absolutely no detail can be seen. sometimes it goes offline. i close and reopen the app and that usually does the trick. its just ok. i think there are better products out there within the same price range.<br /><br />some pros - easy to set up. I like how it provides the temperature and humidity levels, the noise and movement detection graph comes in handy,  and also like the fact that you can control the music and night light from your phone. another plus is that i check can on him from anywhere. if grandma is watching him, i can check to see if he gets to bed on time."
Baby,5.0,It's super cute and can also be used as a toy,My son loves this little guy. It's super cute and can also be used as a toy.
Baby,3.0,Three Stars,Barely wraps around my 16 lb baby's wrist
Baby,5.0,... several jumpers for our twins and this is our favorite! Adorable music,"We have several jumpers for our twins and this is our favorite! Adorable music, lots of fun gadgets for them to play with."
Baby,5.0,"Great quality, inexpensive","Inexpensive, yet high quality.  Fits on Britax B Agile and BOB SUS."
Baby,1.0,One Star,i thought size free but tis item is better to newborn baby
Baby,1.0,it looks like its about to fall apart,"this product is FAKE. DO NOT BUY. The package on it is fake and the stuff animal is so poorly crafted, it looks like its about to fall apart."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,It looks better than I expected..
Baby,4.0,Does the job well - would have prefered a different design,"They do the trick. It's hard to tell if they are properly snapped or leak-proof sometimes, but I haven't had any issues.<br />I would have rather had a sealing disk/cover that was separate from cover that goes with the nipple, so that I could keep those pieces together."
Baby,5.0,It has a very nice sized attach strap that fits on her car seat ...,My niece loves this toy. It was a lot bigger than I expected. It has a very nice sized attach strap that fits on her car seat and her bouncy chair play unit. Very happy with this product.
Baby,5.0,Great Product.,My Grandson loves this!
Baby,5.0,highly recommended,My son loves this!!!! best thing I have bought. He is 6 months old bought it for him before he was born and we have yet to loose it. the feet are weighted so it dont fall off of him and he can hold on to the monkey. love this product and willl buy for friends and family with upcoming babys!! just go ahead and buy it . the only bad thing is that the pacifier does not detact from the monkey just cant put it in the dishwasher.
Baby,5.0,Love it,Very practical
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Bought as a gift.  Well Made.
Baby,4.0,Great travel toy,"I purchased this as a gift for a 6 month old girl who already had Captain Calamari by Lamaze.  Captain Calamari has more legs and seems to entertain her a little better.  However, this one can be easily attached to her stroller and car seat and will get plenty of use during travel."
Baby,3.0,... to the hospital style nuk/paci/binki then its not as cool as it seems,If your baby isn't used to the hospital style nuk/paci/binki then its not as cool as it seems. Really do wish they had these with different options for the nuk at the end. I may just sew one of ours to it!!! :-)  super awesome concept just needs more options to taylor to different babies.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby loves it
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Excellent monitor, great option!"
Baby,1.0,one defect out of 4,"I visited my military family in TN. This was a gift for my 22lb grandson.  When he sat in it the 3 bars bent inwards. I insisted we return it but my son said it was probably the weight. I have 4 grandchildren and I bought each one theirs. The oldest 8, next, 4, next 3 and this one 7 months. I believe this was a defect but since I was visiting and it was a gift I let it go."
Baby,5.0,Fantastic Jumperoo,Our daughter loves this Jumperoo!!  We saw other better looking ones that cost more however the reviews on this Jumperoo have lived up to the hype.
Baby,5.0,"Great, simple organizer","Excellent for the price - bought one of these to add to our umbrella stroller for a recent vacation.  Worked great for cups, keys, etc."
Baby,5.0,Awesome Jumper!,My son got too heavy to bounce up and down myself. This jumper is a lifesaver! I highly recommend.
Baby,5.0,My granddaughter just turned 5 months. And even though ...,My granddaughter just turned 5 months. And even though she can't touch the ground and we have to put a pillow under her tiny little feet...She Loves This Thing!  :)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,This fit perfect for our Britax Affinity stroller and fits alot
Baby,5.0,WubbaNubs are my ABSOLUTE favorite!! I buy them as gifts for all ...,WubbaNubs are my ABSOLUTE favorite!!  I buy them as gifts for all of my new mom friends.  Apparently they were first used to help comfort babies in the NICU.  They are great to swaddle with because a tight wrap keeps them from falling out of their mouth.  Highly recommended for new moms!!  I used to buy two of the same animal in case one got lost.
Baby,1.0,Don't waste your money,Do Not buy this monitor. Withings does not stand behind their product. I was very happy with it for a few short months after which it stopped working consistently. The connection was unclear and interrupted constantly. Assuming it was my wifi connection I did not follow up with the company. Eventually we no longer had a need for the monitor & packed it away (very lightly used). Now baby number 2 is on the way & it won't even turn on. After days of exchanged emails with customer service they offered a 25% discount on a new one & suggested I upgrade to a home system. For the price of this monitor I expect more. Don't waste your money.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Keeps my kiddo pretty entertained!
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love this! Catchy music, lots of bright colors, and plenty of toys to entertain my baby!"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,So cute!
Baby,5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!! THAT'S IT, JUST LOVE IT!!!! This is the absolute best purchase I have made in the baby items bar none! So my baby started at age 3 months in position 1 and stayed in that position till she completed 6 months. The day she turned 6 months old, she moved to next position level 2. And then again she started loving it jumping up high. Go for it - don't even think about it!! Best purchase if you want some peace and quiet to yourself (by peace I mean baby screaming and jumping and just having fun in her jumper) :) :) :)"
Baby,3.0,Just OK,"I love ALL Fisher Price products--but for the amount of money I paid for this Jumperoo, I was expecting a little more. The toys are not super engaging, and it only plays 4 (lame) songs, then shuts off until my daughter bounces around a bit.My 4 month old gets bored easily and I was hoping this Jumperoo might buy me about 20 minutes at a time while I did dishes or folded laundry. She tends to last about 10 minutes, then is done. She does fit in it (feet touch the ground), so that's not the issue. Maybe it will occupy her more when she's older? I don't know, I was just expecting something more exciting for her."
Baby,5.0,This is a great item to place on your umbrella stroller or any ...,"This is a great item to place on your umbrella stroller or any stroller which does not have a drink holder.  What I really liked about the organizer was that it easily installs and removes with Velcro straps.  The organizer is large and spacious and I used to store my cell phone, drinks and snacks and had plenty of space for other items if needed."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Amazing find!!
Baby,5.0,Easy to use,"Exactly as pictured. Easy to use, simple great organizer."
Baby,5.0,LOVE!!!,"Love it!!!!!!! The perfect addition to my umbrella stroller. I have a place to put drinks, my keys, cell phone, etc."
Baby,5.0,Great toy that my baby is giddy over using!,"My eight month old daughter loves this Jumperoo!  She shrieks with joy while she's bouncing up and down, and has been using it for fun since she was a little over four months old.  She's a &#34;tall&#34; baby and she's still on the lowest setting, meaning that there's two more notches to raise it up so she'll be having fun for many more months to come.  She likes to spin around and look at all the different &#34;activities&#34; and even figured out how to start the music up by spinning the little wheel.  This was a great toy purchase, and I would recommend this particular product for any of my friends with children.  As far as looks go, it's not as subdued as I would like (Looks garish in my living room) but I know the bright colors are good for young baby's eye development so I can't complain too much."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great condition. My son loves his
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Both kiddos loved this
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Works perfect on our Bob stroller. It's incredibly sturdy and holds a lot.
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,I like this mat but it's really for small babies.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My little one absolutely loves this!! He will jump until he falls asleep. Worth every bit!
Baby,5.0,This is a great toy for a baby no complaints other than I ...,This  is a great toy for a baby no complaints other than I wish the music Toy played different songs
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My grandson loves this jumper!
Baby,1.0,Baby dint like after a few days,"Returned- was not so impressed with it in first place- when my baby also refused to jump after few days, i returned it.<br />its for really small babies, who would want to be confined in one place, mine was crawling really soon at 6 months, so she had better things to do and move around and explore than jump in this."
Baby,5.0,"Great product, great customer service!","We thought long and hard about the monitor we wanted for our first baby, and feel confident that we made a great choice with Withings. As a working mom, the remote viewing feature is indispensable, especially during those first few months. We're excited to use it again with our second child, due in a few short weeks, and after losing the crib-mounting parts in a recent move I was pleasantly surprised to find how accommodating the customer service team was - they quickly responded to my request for help and are shipping me replacement parts free of charge! I would highly recommend this monitor and the company in general. We are also satisfied owners of the Withings scale :)"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Good organiser for buggies that did not come with one preinstalled.
Baby,5.0,Excellent cupholder for Maclaren Quest stroller,"I used it on my Maclaren Quest stroller and it fit great. Sippy cups, water bottles, coffee cups, phones and small items can fit well. So worth the price.."
Baby,3.0,"Cute and soft, but my grandson who is 5 ...","Cute and soft, but my grandson who is 5 months old just yanks it out of his mouth instead of keeping it in, which was what the purpose of getting it for him."
Baby,5.0,Great Toy. Great Price.,"This is a great toy and much less expensive than most.  Good mixture of dongles to play with.  There's light sound via a small rattle, plush parts, soft silicon parts and harder parts good for teething.  I like the velcro strap as well (vs. the plastic hooks on some) as it is more versatile and we can put it in his stroller, car seat, etc."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Love it!!
Baby,5.0,Four month old jumper,"My granddaughter is four months old and she LOVES this! Initially she was too short, so we just put a small pillow under her feet. By the following week she was tall enough. She hasn't quite mastered twisting yet, but she sure bounces, lol. She also grabs the green 'legs' of the one toy with the elephant and holds on while she jumps. I sent a pic to her parents the first day, total blur, we all chuckled. I feel confident of the construction, stability, entertainment and educational value of this product."
Baby,3.0,Dried out wipes not good.,The slide closure don't stay shut. Dried out wipes not good.
Baby,3.0,Great little accessory for my sons car seat,"Great little accessory for my sons car seat, BUT it hangs really low. I have the Graco Snug Ride car seat/base combo and this thing just hangs in his face. I have to move it all the way over to the side of the top bar to keep it from hitting him in the face. The picture doesn't show it that way, so it could just be my car seat."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My baby girl loves this
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Great little carrier for stroller
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My son enjoys it.
Baby,5.0,... to so many stores and could not find anything like this. So nice to be able to store ...,I went to so many stores and could not find anything like this. So nice to be able to store expressed milk in the bottle.
Baby,5.0,a godsend,"Our 2 month old loves this. Doesn't put her to sleep, but keeps her occupied for twenty minutes. It's beautiful and has nice movement"
Baby,5.0,My fussy baby loves this,"My baby loves this! Didn't take her long to learn cause/effect of motion and music. This from a baby who doesn't like most baby things, including her swing. The seat seems to be snug, which works well for her, but may be too snug for a larger baby (She's 16 lbs., 24.5 inches)"
Baby,5.0,perfect,Luv this to bits. And my baby loves it more. Goes crazy in it. A must have for a happy baby. Definetly recommend it to all parents.
Baby,5.0,My 9 month loves it,It took him a bit to figure out how to actually use it for jumping but now enjoys it.
Baby,4.0,It works...,"It took a bit, but my son loves this!!"
Baby,5.0,Great pacifier & toy in 1!,"My son LOVES his! Been using it since he was born & he won't go anywhere without it. I do wish the pacifier would remove when washing the monkey.<br />The pacifier is starting to rip off because of that & my son always yanking the monkey & playing with it. I will be buying more for him, highly recommend!"
Baby,5.0,nice universal stroller organizer will work on any brand.,"The Velcro tabs make this usable in basically any stroller.  They are pretty strong, they held two or three full drinks at a time without coming undone."
Baby,5.0,Great product. Great price.,My son loves this. By 4/5 months he was using it just fine with nothing under his feet. Great price.
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it!,My baby loves it. It was easy to assemble and seems very comfortable for him. The toys keep him engaged for a long time.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,satisified.
Baby,5.0,Love it!!,"I bought this for my Granddaughter, she loves it!!  She jumps so high and hard and just giggles the whole time.  She has even fallen asleep in it a few times.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun jumper.  Comes apart easily for traveling."
Baby,4.0,Four Stars,Sturdy and fulfills its purpose
Baby,5.0,My daughter (6 months old)! finds this toy fascinating ...,My daughter (6 months old)!finds this toy fascinating and has chewed on every surface of it. It's her car seat toy and she only sees it when she is in the car seat. She can keep herself entertained with the toy for the 45 minute ride to grandma's house.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My daughter loves this
Baby,1.0,A disappointment given how awesome the Avent bottles are,"Returned these. The point is to act as a solid lid on bottles without needing a nipple. They have one job to do and they don't do it. The tiny dot in the center of the disk where the plastic molding was snipped from the mold-maker (presumably), is the leak point on these things. 3 of the 5 in the package leaked when tipped from that location when tipped upside down with water (not going to test it with breastmilk). A disappointment given how awesome the Avent bottles are."
Baby,5.0,great product!,I always thought these were weird until my friend gave me some a a gift for my 40 year old surprise baby boy. These things rock!! Seriously! You can rest them in tiny baby's chest and even if they spit it out it doesn't got anywhere and is right there when they want it. I seriously have gotten more sleep with this baby because of this product! Monkey is cute for girls or boys
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Love it, very sturdy, and it works with our big stroller and our umbrella stroller"
Baby,2.0,Not enough sound,These rattles barely make any sound. My baby was not interested in them at all. They are super cute and I just wish they made enough sound to make her happy.
Baby,3.0,"Wait to purchase until baby is 5/6 months and at least 30"" long","Based on others reviews I decided to purchase this for my 4 month old.  However, his feet still do not touch the ground (at all) even on the lowest level/setting.  He is currently 25.12&#34; long.  So I would probably recommend that people wait until at least baby is 30&#34; to purchase this jumperoo. I also tried to put a pillow on the ground so he could jump on that while in the jumperoo, but it just makes him more frustrated.  Also, he is unable to turn the chair on his own right now and I think this will happen when he gets older.  So to get the full usage of this jumperoo I would probably wait to purchase until baby is at least 5 or 6 months and 30&#34; long."
Baby,5.0,thumbs up.,This is so great for the price! useful and fits my stroller well.
Baby,5.0,Must Have!,"We cannot live without this for our 11 month old. It was perfect when he was younger and had trouble grasping small objects. Sometimes he doesn't even use the paci part of it, the monkey acts as enough of a &#34;security blanket&#34; for him.<br />When he was smaller, we also propped this up on his chest into his mouth when he is in his crib so it less likely to fall and roll away."
Baby,5.0,"Adorable, roomy, and toddler approved!","This plate is adorable! I like how it's a little larger than most toddler plates out there while still being completely &#34;toddler-proof&#34; - the material is sturdy yet gentle enough that I don't have to worry when my (almost) 2-year-old tosses his plate around. At the same time there's finally enough room here to fit his whole meal on one plate - which hasn't been possible with his other toddler plates over the last few months as his appetite has grown like crazy! Great plate all around, and wonderful solution for anyone looking for something that will get their little one to be more interested at mealtime (my son loves the monkey design, makes him giggle!) or if you just wish kids' plates had a little more room."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My nephew loves this toy!
Baby,3.0,I have a joovy caboose stroller and use this. ...,I have a joovy caboose stroller and use this. I wish it would stay straighter when velcroed on... it sort of leans forward making it hard to hold drinks in unless they are bottled. But it serves its purpose to hold my phone and keys.
Baby,5.0,Great gift!,Im at the point in life where all my friends are having babies. This is my go-to baby shower gift. Everyone I've given one to has listed it in their top must have baby items they couldn't live without. It's nice for newborns because it doesn't pop out of their mouth as easily as other pacifiers. It's a great item that grows with baby.
Baby,5.0,We love it!,"This is my second one. My son loves them. The monkey lays flat on his tummy, which is why I like it. Will be buying another soon!"
Baby,5.0,Baby loves it,"Our baby loves this! He's 8 months now, and has enjoyed playing with this since he was 3 months old. He loves feeling the different textures, playing with the rings, and chewing on the horse's ears and the knight's head :)"
Baby,5.0,We love it!!,My 5 month old LOVES IT!! It was so easy to put together. I haven't out the batteries in there yet and he still loves it lol
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,Very functional.
Baby,5.0,Great jumperoo,Great jumperoo! My 5 month old baby loves it!
Baby,5.0,Wonderful,"I bought this as a gift for my niece. She loves it. All she wants to do is play in it. Easy to put together, and it arrived quickly. The perfect gift. It's very strudy and came just as it would if I bought it in the store"
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,The best pacis and the only ones we use! Plus they are much harder to lose!
Baby,5.0,has also a very good quality.,"Did just perfectly fit my Quinny Buzz Extra, has also a very good quality."
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,Very cute bit TINY!
Baby,5.0,"Monitor from your phone, anywhere!","Love this so much, I'm now purchasing a second one.<br /><br />Before Withings monitor, we previously tried two others. But they did not allow access away from the home nor did they have apps available on your phone. You had to have seperate baby monitor devices. It's a pain. So I thought I'd give this one a try, and I'm so glad I did. We don't seem to have any issues with the app or connectivity as some other reviews have stated. My husband and I both have the apps installed on our phones and iPads and all seem to work smoothly, almost 100% of the time.<br />The reason I am buying a second, however, is because the device which attaches to the railing of the crib does not fit our crib. Our crib railings are rather thick and the attachment does not stretch far enough to fit around them. Well, last night, my daughter learned how to stand in her crib (yes, we are lowering the mattress tonight!) and knocked the monitor onto the ground. Since the attachment didn't fit, we simply set it on the edge of the crib. Until now, it wasn't an issue. But overall, it's an awesome product and we love it. The reason for it breaking is our &#34;fault&#34; and I'm happy to purchase another one. Thanks for making a great monitor. I rest better at night knowing I have constant access to view my baby girl."
Baby,4.0,Awesome find.,"I love these and you cannot beat the price. My only complaint is the cup holder.  The pocket for it is soft, so that if something moves in the pocket next to it or you hit a hard bump the beverage will spill if it does not have a solid lid.  Other than that it has a zip pocket, looks sharp and holds up well."
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My 6 months old baby loves it.
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,My kids love these things. Keeps them entertained in the car.
Baby,5.0,Great Value,Very cute. Long so hangs in face. Good for $6.00

Baby,1.0,don't waste your money,pacifier does not stay in baby's mouth.  thought this was a waste of money
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,fine
Baby,5.0,Makes Baby Giddy,"My 6 month old loves it!  She's a little on the short side, so I put a pillow under her feet so she can get some traction.  Every time she gets into it she tries to send herself into orbit.  Love it!"
Baby,5.0,Favorite Binkie,Our grandson started on this binkie while still in the NICU. The monkey's weight keeps it pretty much in place - and because of its size it hasn't been misplaced or lost.
Baby,5.0,And I love it because it doesn't roll out of her crib,"The only pacifier my daughter will take. And I love it because it doesn't roll out of her crib, so when she wakes up in the middle of the night there is no more search."
Baby,5.0,does its job well,works well for our City Mini!
Baby,5.0,Great jumper!,It got shipped here super fast and 6 month old loves this!

Baby,5.0,Love it,Super interactive just hard to transport.
Baby,1.0,One Star,Was broquen
Baby,5.0,No complaints here,"Well I won't get technical with this review, but my kid seems to love this thing.  Also, it isn't to complicated to assemble.  My child loves to bounce around while we take care of daily chores."
Baby,5.0,Makes formula feeding easier,"I do a combination of breastfeeding, pumping and formula feeding.  With the formula, I need to sterilize bottles and boil water to make sure the formula is safe for my babies. These lids are a lifesaver!  I can boil water and then store it in my Philips bottles thanks to these lids.  I can also  make 8 ounces of formula at a time and store it in the fridge to make overnight feedings of my twins a little bit easier.  The lids fit on easily to any of my Avent bottles and they seal quite well.  They are easy to wash and hold up to washing and the sterilizer quite well.  If you want to have boiled water or pre-made bottles on hand, these are a must have."
Baby,5.0,Great place for baby when I need a few min ...,Baby loves jumping in this. Great place for baby when I need a few min to get something done.
Baby,1.0,This was a waste of money,"This was a waste of money :( The red dot falls off all the time, and it doesn't keep the wipes from drying out. We threw it out."
Baby,4.0,It was easy to put together,My kid loves it. It was easy to put together.
Baby,4.0,Grandsons's favorite toy,this is one of my Grandson's favorite toys! But he cut himself somewhere on it and his Mom couldn't figure out where but he jumps like a mad man in it so maybe the friction of him jumping fast holding onto to the tray caused the scratch. It was a tiny scratch and now when she sees him jumping crazy she tells him to stop and there hasn't been anymore accidents
Baby,4.0,Beautiful and practical if only my baby can enjoy it longer than 10 mins,My son enjoy it for a little while and hen gets fussy because he wants out:)
Baby,5.0,Five Stars,"Perfect, love!"
Baby,2.0,Two Stars,i've tried it in 3 different strollers and it doesn't fit well.
Beauty,5.0,"Very simple, easy-to-read book - fantastic!","What a great book!<br /><br />Laid out extremely well, with all the concepts explained very simply and well put together.<br /><br />A quick read of this book will yield great benefits in saving you time and helping you prioritise.<br /><br />A \\""must\\"" for your business book collection."
Beauty,4.0,"Not perfect, but so entertaining that doesn t matter too much...","\\""Underworld: evolution\\"" is the sequel to \\""Underworld\\"", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of \\""Underworld: evolution\\"", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, \\""Underworld: evolution\\"" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: To Len Wiseman,please hurry up and make another sequel, I want to know what happens next to Selene and Michael :)<br /><br />PS2: To parents, this movie has quite a lot of violence and a nude scene, so it is not adequate for children.ree and wreaking havoc.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind.

Beauty,5.0,absolutely beautiful!,This film is a shattering powerhouse of emotion but crafted in such a way as to gently pull the rug from under your feet and place a cushion under your bott as you come to rest. Box of tissues essential. A gem
Beauty,5.0,Great show. Enjoyable.,"I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode \\""One on One,\\"" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf&eacute;. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity.

Beauty,5.0,Like new again,Right outta the box and onto my razor in just a few minutes.  My shaver works like it did when it was new.
Beauty,5.0,Great Value,Can't beat the price nor speed of delivery. Condition of item was great and works prefect in shaver.  Would recommend this to others that are looking to save money.
Beauty,1.0,Not the right one...,This item did not fit my shaver despite being labeled for the Series 3. Apparently mine does not take cassettes.
Beauty,5.0,Great,These are sadly hard to find in any store.  But I got em here and my husband uses it everyday!
Beauty,5.0,Replace razor head every year,It is very important to replace the head as Braun recomends. It really works. Shaves like a new razor.I guess reading the directions is important. I was ready to get a new razor.
Beauty,5.0,Help for Curly girls!,This booked helped me learn about the care and maintenance of my wavy hair and I finally have consistent 'good hair' days.<br /><br />The DVD that comes with it demonstrates the techniques described in the book.
Beauty,4.0,A little scary,"I forgot how scary this movie can be for little kids, probably better for seven and up, not for toddlers like some other princess movies might be."
Beauty,1.0,DVD skipped!,"The DVD i received stalled/skipped and we tried to use it in 2 different DVD players. Yes, we took it out and cleaned it and tried at least 4 times. Very disappointed!"
Beauty,5.0,love old series,enjoy your favorite old hit on DVD! Kids of the 90's will apreciate re living all the old story lines and having a refresher on what happened with the 90210 gang!
Beauty,4.0,Ok,These were what we needed for this razor. They don't seem to last very long but that isn't the vendor it is the brand I have decided.
Beauty,5.0,Sleeping Beauty,Love the Disney movies and needed to purchase this to add to my collection.  I would recommend to all (:
Beauty,5.0,Love this book & products,"Thank You Ms Massey for writing this book and for your products!!! Love the book & DVD very informative and the products are awesome. You will find the products can be pricey unless you shop around here on Amazon, that being said if your a curly girl all the $$$ you've spent on products that don't work it evens out overall. I know this is supposed to be a review about the book (love it) but it really goes hand in hand with the products so that's why I've put it in here. So glad I'm not the only curly girl with nightmarish memories of my hair (mostly at others hands) growing up. And the old pictures so funny ahh memories! LoL!!!"
Beauty,5.0,Happy,"Movie is awesome, of course. Its so nice on DVD, excellent picture. I don't think blu-ray would make much of an improvement.<br />."
Beauty,1.0,Bad tape,The movie will stop at one spot and freeze. The only way I can get it going again is to stop it and then start it up at the next scene. It is really annoying.
Beauty,5.0,curly girl is a hair whirl,"this book is great, it outlines all of the daily maintenance for curly hair routines,<br />whilst supplying recipes to make your own hair products....<br />love it."
Beauty,5.0,I love it.,"Despite that it is used, the state of the product is perfect, and it has the slipcover. I recommend this totally."
Beauty,5.0,Brought back memories :),"I have not seen this film since I was a child, so it was a wonderful trip down memory lane for me. And my daughter loves it too! She has an Aurora Barbie and a little Sleeping Beauty book that we read, so it was a treat for her to actually see the DVD. I especially like the singing voice of Aurora, and the Three Good Fairie's personalities. The only complaint I have is that 16 years old is way too young to get married (these days, lol). Although Aurora and Phillip do not actually get married in this film, it is still talked about like they will be getting married very soon, like at age 16. Also, If you have a child who is scared of &#34;villians&#34; in stories, then the bad fairie Maleficent is pretty scary, lol, so you may want to wait until your child is older and can handle it better. Other than those two things, this is a very sweet young love story of a prince and princess who fall for each other, when they don't even know they are betrothed to one another already. And what the prince endures to save the princess from the evil fairie is a very romantic notion indeed."
Beauty,4.0,Like New,"Per Braun instructions, you should replace the shaver head every 18 months. Once I recieved my new cassette, I popped it on, oiled it, and it shaves like a brand new razor.<br /><br />To those that gave a poor review because it didn't fit your razor. Remember to look under your trimmer, it usually will tell you what replacement cassette or head you need."
Beauty,5.0,Braun Shave Cassette,"I was so happy to find this product.  I had searched the local retailers, even the one where we purchased the shaver, but was unable to find the product.  The price was reasonable and the delivery was quick."
Beauty,4.0,Enchanting movie,Loved the movie and really enjoyed learning how the movie was made. Aurora is my 3 year olds favorite princess. She asks to watch it every day.
Beauty,4.0,Works Well and Lasts a Long Time,"Works great and is very reasonably priced.  It fits my Braun shaver/trimmer perfectly, and the last one was usable for more than a year."
Beauty,3.0,Can balance the skin color,"Cannot cover dark spot perfectly, but it can make skin smooth and balance the skin color. Also it not smell bad ."
Beauty,5.0,very nice,i really like it. it is better than BB cream. it won't make you skin look gray like some does
Beauty,5.0,Curly Girl The Handbook,This book is exactly what every curly girl needs.  I'm a faithful DevaCurl product user having seen awesome results with their<br />products.  My curls are now manageable and beautiful thanks to DevaCurl handbook and products.
Beauty,1.0,Rip off,"Over $1/blade?  I've bought 75 blade sampler packs for less than half ($18) of what this seller is charging.  None of these blades are over $2/pack, so you could buy these individually for about $10.  Don't get suckered buy this severely over priced &#34;deal&#34;."
Beauty,4.0,Great condition and fast delivery,"Have not watched the dvd yet, but the product came 2 days before the estimated delivery day and it was brand new.  It was still wrapped in coating and had no scratch marks on dvd.  Condition looked new, like it stated.  Once I see how it runs, I will change the rating to a 5."
Beauty,4.0,Four Stars,Great

Beauty,5.0,Best CC cream I've tried,This product is great and I've tried several popular Korean CC creams. It completely and natural cancels out my redness while making my skin look moisturized and healthy. The scent in the product is even growing on me now! Will definitely repurchase.
Beauty,5.0,Five Stars,Why the hell is this 129....
Beauty,1.0,"Great product, crappy price.",Why pay the list price of $35 when you can pay almost 4 times as much for the same product?!?!
Beauty,5.0,Five Stars,Great.

Beauty,5.0,Braun Series 3 shaver cassette,I believe this is a wonderful product and the cost was reasonable. It arrived undamaged and also prior the projected arrival date.
Beauty,5.0,Five Stars,thanks
Beauty,3.0,Not for medium tan skin tone,Amazing formula but way too light for my skin tone.
Beauty,1.0,One Star,I brought the wrong one
Beauty,5.0,Five Stars,Great replacement cartridges for my razor! Arrived exactly as described and on time.
Beauty,5.0,Highly  recommend,Perfect replacement for original..arrived quickly..recommend.highly
Beauty,5.0,Adjustable Nozzle!,LeGrande Francisco hair spray is amazing! It has great hold and still allows my hair to move but most of all my favorite feature is the adjustable nozzle so I'm in control of the flow.
Grocery,3.0,Traditional Afternoon not English Afternoon,"There is no real description, so ....<br /><br />Traditional Afternoon is a blend of Kenyan, Assam, and Ceylon teas from the 'Direct From England' line. It is bright, full-bodied and strong. [It is close to the English Breakfast blend.]<br /> Traditional Afternoon is bold, brisk and refreshing.<br /><br />Twinings Classics line blends Keemun and Ceylon teas for their English Afternoon Tea.<br /><br />Keemun is considered to have the best flavor and one of the best aromas.<br />[It is what the Queen drinks. That's a good thing.]<br /><br />Description:<br />[[ASIN:B000F4DKAI Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]]is a medium-based blend of Keemun and Ceylon black teas and has a medium flavor strength.<br />A brisk and lively black tea with the flavor of smokiness and earthiness combined with elements of sweetness.<br /><br />Both of these teas are excellent, BTW."
Grocery,5.0,Delightful Full Flavor Strength - Perfect for the Afternoon!,"This tea is very unique as a blend of African/Kenyan, Assam, and Ceylon teas. This is definitely \\""Best enjoyed with milk.\\"" as the full-flavor strength balances well even with heaps of milk. This is especially useful if generous with adding milk to hot beverages, as I am! Even without milk, the tea is suprisingly smooth for being a strong tea which makes it unlike many other black teas I've tried.<br /><br />Although it doesn't appear to indicate Full Flavor Strength on the packaging pictured here, the blends are indentical to slightly different packaging by the same brand in Australia. Here they indicate it is Full Flavor Strength with five filled tea leaves on the front of the package.<br /><br />It appears based on the information on Amazon that this tea is a cross between the [[ASIN:B000F4H5GI Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Ceylon and Assam)and the [[ASIN:B000F4F952 Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Kenyan and Assam ) and yet this is an afternoon tea. However not to be confused with [[ASIN:B000F4DKAI Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, 1.41 oz. Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Keemun and Ceylon) which is entirely different and probably tastes different enough too."
Grocery,5.0,Very nice tea - great for the afternoon,I am a fan of most Twinings teas and bought the Traditional Afternoon not having tried it before. I was not disappointed.  I find it is a nice pick-me-up at work in the afternoon.  The only complaint I have is that it is not available in the US.
Grocery,1.0,tea bags coated with toxic chemical,"All twinings tea bags are coated with epichlorophydrin (per Twinings!), which has been implicated in infertility and suppressed immune function per Dr. Mercola.  I would avoid all twinings bags and stick with loose tea.  Their tea quality otherwise excellent.  Product ordered from Amazon by a friend, as a gift to me."
Grocery,5.0,Mmmmmmm,Ben & Jerry's recipes are out of this world;). If one has the patience and passion for better tasting ice cream then one should consider the purchase of this book.<br />v/r<br />c5load
Grocery,5.0,Great Recipes! Great Sellor!,The book arrived timely and was in perfect condition.<br />The recipes are easy to follow and have turned out delicious ice cream.<br />I would recommend the book and book seller to everyone.
Grocery,5.0,Excellent Book for the Beginner,"This book is dated but ice cream making hasn't changed much. It contains a plethora of simple ice cream and sorbet recipes. There's even a couple of baking and sauce recipes. Many people will take issue with the fact that the base recipe does not direct you to cook your egg mixture, however, I simply heat my eggs, milk, and sugar until almost boiling. Then I add the heavy cream, etc, and cool the mixture. Simple. You will find every flavor you could want and some you might not want. I've tried half a dozen recipes and have loved each one. This is a great reference book. Enjoy!"
Grocery,5.0,Excellent Tea,"I love this tea.  I generally drink it for breakfast (and I prefer Irish breakfast tea in the afternoon, go figure), very strong and with no milk added.  I find it is a bit lighter than other teas I drink (primarily Assam and the aforementioned Irish breakfast tea), but by no means weak or flavorless.  It does not get bitter or develop off flavors when brewed up strong, a quality much appreciated since I don't add anything to my tea.  It is very smooth and pleasant.  (I've just now taken a sip of this  tea which has been sitting in my teapot, with the tea bags, for over two hours and it is mellow, almost silky, and yes, still hot.  God bless tea cozies.)<br /><br />If you enjoy Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, English Breakfast Tea, or any of the teas which make up this blend (Kenyan, Ceylon, and Assam I believe, although my package is no more specific than &#34;Africa, Sri Lanka, and India&#34;) you should consider giving this a try."
Grocery,5.0,Ice Cream,I love this book. It's has a lot of great tips on making Ice Cream with great recipes. I also loved learning about<br />Ben and Jerry and how they started.
Grocery,5.0,great product,"extremely quick service, great product"
Grocery,3.0,Three Stars,Mild but had a bit of chalk taste left on tongue.
Grocery,5.0,My absolute favorite tea. It is full bodied but not bitter,My absolute favorite tea.  It is full bodied but not bitter. I drink this one all day. Thanks for a great product and easy availability.
Grocery,5.0,Five Stars,Just what I wanted.  Thank you.
Grocery,5.0,Great and favorful taste,Wonderful flavor
Grocery,5.0,Five Stars,Great tea
Grocery,5.0,A smooth English tea for a mid-afternoon break,"A smooth English tea for a mid-afternoon break.  Nicely balanced.  These bags are larger than the tea bags you normally find in US supermarkets, and are perfect for making a large mug of tea."
Grocery,5.0,Five Stars,They shipped really fast and the order was great would recommend them to everyone
Grocery,5.0,Love this unique tea blend!,I bought this tea in London and loved it.  It definitely has a distinct flavor and is great in the afternoon.  I was bummed when I finished the tin I had bought because I couldn't find it in stores in the US. I searched for it online and found it on Amazon so I ordered it.  The price is pretty decent considering it is shipped from the UK.  I will likely keep ordering it as I run out.
Home,4.0,I'm changing my initial 4 stars to ZERO,"After using it maybe a total of 7 times it no longer works.  Yes, it has a warranty but as another reviewer put it - is it really worth spending the money for s/h?  Don't waste your money!  I just basically threw away 40 bucks."
Home,5.0,Keeping the housekeeper happy.,We have mostly wood laminate and vinyl floors in our house. We also have 3 parrots and 1 Corgi puppy. Keeping up with dirty floors is a challenge. The Swivel Sweeper has swept away the competition. I am delighted.
Home,5.0,Love it!,"I was a bit skeptical about this product, but decided to try it any way.  I am very happy with it!  It does just what it says - spins into hard to get to areas, picks up everything, etc.  Even on carpet it works, however you have to go a bit slower.  Perfect for linoleum and tile. The tray does have to be emptied frequently but it is so easy to do."
Home,4.0,Decent Product but Oversold on the Commercial,"Updated: January 7, 2006<br /><br />I have now owned the product for six months.  I have nothing to change in my review.  I am surprised that people are having so many problems with this product.  My unit still works fine; the battery holds a charge; the pole has not broken; the handle has not broken.  Maybe my unit is not typical.  However, you do need to have realistic expectations for this product.  The Swivel Sweeper is not a new revolutionary cleaning apparatus worthy of a patent (as the info commercial implies).  It is just an electric sweeper for quick clean ups.  If you want the thorough results that a vacuum provides--use a vacuum.<br /><br />Original Review<br />I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for two weeks.  If you are looking for something better than your dust pan, this is the product for you.  If you are looking for something to replace your vacuum cleaner, you are going to be disappointed.  The pros: light weight, high quality, cordless, rechargeable, easy to use, maneuverable.  The cons: overpriced, can't ever replace a vacuum, time-consuming periodic cleaning.  The product is just what I was looking for: a cordless, rechargeable, electric dust pan that I could keep in the kitchen next to the refrigerator and pull out twice a week and sweep the kitchen floor.  I have a light colored tile floor and it shows every little particle of dirt.  In addition, my cat spreads Friskies on the floor and the sweeper picks up those nicely.  The Swivel Sweep is a fairly high quality product.  All the parts look well designed, fairly durable (they are just plastic), and fit together well.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweep is oversold on the info commercial (as to be expected).  It will never take the place of a vacuum cleaner.  It is not a vacuum cleaner.  It creates no suction.  It is simply a sweeper.  I would summarize it as an electric dust pan.  The product has four rotating brushes that sweep items into a small centralized dust pan with openings on all four sides.  The Swivel Sweeper is much quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.  It makes a tone with medium-high pitched whine.  The picture on the box shows the product being used to sweep dirt from a carpet after a house plant has been toppled--forget it!  That is not a good use of this product.  Use a real vacuum cleaner for that job.  This product is really only effective on hard surfaces.  A dust pan is not what I would use on a carpet.  Yes, you could pick up small items sitting on the surface of a carpet like paper clips, but realistically, to clean a carpet adequately, one should use a vacuum cleaner with strong suction and a powerful beater brush to separate the carpet strands.  The Swivel Sweeper has neither of these.  The Swivel Sweep is not comparable to a real vacuum cleaner.  The Swivel Sweeper has problems picking up some very small items even on hard surfaces.  Sometimes an item will shoot across the floor instead of going into the dust pan.  I find myself going over the same area multiple times to pick up some items (but no big deal).<br /><br />Because the product is fairly new, it is a bit overpriced.  I think $29 would be more appropriate.  I would expect to see it at Target in a year or two for $19.95.  Emptying the dust pan is easy.  Cleaning the sweeper is not.  The Swivel Sweeper comes with a \\""cleaning tool\\"" which is nothing more than a thread cutter/seam ripper (if you know what that is).  Hair (human hair) gets wound around all four brushes and needs to be periodically cut and vacuumed out.  The manual says \\""on occasion\\"" this cleaning need to be done.  The manual indicates the battery will last 45 minutes on one charge.  That seems reasonable since I am still on the original charge and have used the sweeper about 10 times.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product.ch quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.

Home,2.0,Delayed disappointment,"I owned the Swivel Sweeper for 2 months before it broke.  I would have given it 4 - 5 stars before it broke but not anymore.  It does a great job of getting up all the visible dirt, hair, debris, etc. from hard surface flooring and floormats.  I have no carpet in my house so I cannot rate it on that.  It's easy enough to use that my 3-year old loves to help out.  The problem is that something in the gearbox must have broken because the motor makes noise but the brushes don't turn.  Because I am still in the 90-day warranty period, I was given the option of sending another $12.99 (handling fee) to have the unit replaced or return it for a refund of the $40 purchase price.  I haven't decided yet.  I've already spent ~$55 with the purchase price and ridiculous $15 S&H.  I'm not so sure I want to spend another $20 ($7 to send it to them and $13 handling charge) to get another one.  It's just a little too cheaply built.  I'd expect to pay $15 - $20 for the item at Target/Wal-mart."
Home,4.0,A book that leaves you with options...,"This book by Eric Carle is a simple book that I believe could be used many different ways.  You could use this book in weather themes, during a cloud unit, or to stretch the imagination. <br /> <br />You could follow this book with an activity in which your children do their own cloud making, possibly out of cotton balls.   <br /> <br />I think that this book is fun and I really enjoy the illustrations.  I would definitely suggest having this book as a part of your classroom library. <br />"
Home,2.0,not worth the money,Please save your money. I purchased mine after reading a glowing review.   This items is cheaply made and will not stand up.  I paid $70.CAD  plus shipping and taxes and will send it back.  It does not live up to it's powerful billing.  Dust and cat hair just get blown around.  The canister holds next to nothing.  The two mini sweepers are just a joke.  There must be better products for the money.  On the plus side it is small and easy to manuever and better on carpets than hardwood.  The cons outway any pros.
Home,5.0,SUPER SWEEPER,"I have had my Swivel Sweeper for 5 months and LOVE it!  It is great on both carpet & smooth floors.  People need to use the little cutter tool to cut threads that get wrapped around the brushes & empty the dirt tray.   <br />In fact, I am purchasing 3 more for my children as Christmas presents. <br />Great for pet hair...I have 2 little dogs and my sweeper picks up their hair off the carpet & vinyl floor. <br />I do think the shipping is a bit pricey since the sweeper is so light but I have NO regrets!!!"
Home,4.0,Better battery than  Shark sweeper,"I bought 5 Shark sweepers (some replacements, some gifts). I loved them and even saved parts to keep at least one alive. One is still good for 5 minutes at a time. I gave up on them because even the replacement batteries don't last.  <br />  I bought a Swivel Sweeper. The battery is much better, but the sweeper doesn't pick up larger items. It's great for bits and pieces. I do really like it, though. It's not that noisy and light and maneuverable as can be. <br /> OK, maybe the warrantee might be doomed with this, but I've been using both commercially in a restaurant. The Shark was absolutely great for this application. It would pick up glass, french fries, toothpicks, cigarette butts---anything. The swivel sweeper won't (more bending over!) but it's much better at getting in tight spaces under chairs (without having to move them).  <br />  They are  NOT vacuum cleaners. They don't suck dirt out of the carpet. The swivel sweeper is great for quick fixes and so far I haven't had a problem with it at all(4 months).I just wish they (both shark and swivel sweeper) would make a commercial product that would last. I would be willing to pay more. Maybe someone out there could create one that would combine all the good qualities.  <br />  I think anyone with a restaurant should check out swivel sweeper. Even if it isn't NSF!"
Home,3.0,Good for quick cleanups,"I bought one of these to do quick cleaning when I don't feel like pulling out the upright vac and fighting with the cord.  Works pretty much as advertised, although don't expect it to do more than light removal of loose dirt, crumbs, etc.  It's not going to get up pet fur or ground in dirt. Very light weight and easy to carry up and down the stairs.  Works much better on carpet than bare floors.  It will pick up on hard floors but takes a few passes to get all the dirt.  If you have carpeted stairs, you will find it handy to quickly clean up the steps.  The Swivel Sweeper is simply made and has a dirt tray on the bottom that is easy to snap out and dump.  The battery is easily removable and fits into a wall charger for recharge.  It seems like a well designed product, but I can't comment on reliability because I just purchased it. (The warranty is 90 days.) I would it have rated it at maybe four stars if it were a little less expensive, say about  $25.00. (I think the pretty hefty little rechargeable battery and wall charger is responsible for the higher cost)."
Home,1.0,do not buy this,"I used this product for two weeks, through one battery recharge, and it no longer works. I used it for quick crumb and dust pick up, never thinking it would replace my vacuum. I paid $30.00 for it at Home Depot. I hope I will be able to return it. The customer service department of the company that markets this is difficult to reach.  I do not think anyone works there! DO NOT BUY THIS."
Home,1.0,Biggest piece of junk ever,"Got one of these for my birthday... honestly, it is nothing more than a noisy toy. Firstly, it is not very effective - you have to run the darned thing back and forth, back and forth,  especially with cat hair, laundry detergent, etc. It somewhat works on perfectly flat surfaces, depending on what you're trying to sweep, so forget tile floors, natural stone floors, door jambs. Forget using it on a rug; also gets tangled in rug fringes. Make sure you keep it level, too, or else all the mess you just swept up falls back out again. Frankly, it is much easier just to take out the dustpan and broom."
Home,1.0,Terrible...,"This item is flimsy and close to nonfunctional. During its first use in what was supposed to be a quick 5-minute bathroom and kitchen pickup, the sweeper stopped working five times for unknown reasons, making it necessary to take it apart and restart each time. I will try to return it. Not recommended."
Home,1.0,Battery died after 4 months!,"I liked the sweeper until the battery died after just 4 months. Won't hold a charge. Would cost about $25 to replace. That's 1/2 of what I paid for the whole unit, and no guaranty the new battery will work any better. The sweeper would be great if they put a little more quality into it. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
Home,1.0,A Real Disappointment,"I purchased a Swivel Sweeper, manufactured by Ontel Products, through amazon.com.  The handle broke the third time it was used.  We followed the directions in the manual, which said to send the sweeper, still on warranty, to Ontel with a check for $12.99 to cover shipping of a replacement.  When no replacement was received within a reasonable time, we called them to find out what was happening.  They could not find the package we sent to them, even though their warehouse manager signed for it. We informed Customer Service of the UPS Tracking Information, with the name of the person who signed for the package at Ontel, the manager of the warehouse. Customer Service said we should stop payment on the original check and send them another check or give them a credit card number in order for them to send us a replacement.  A stop-payment would cost us $30.   <br /> <br />In other words, they would not take responsibility for their mistake.  In view of their terrible service, I would not recommend Ontel products to anyone. <br /> <br />Other comments from customers indicate they have had similar problems with Swivel Sweeper Handles cracking or breaking. Swivel Sweepers are definitely an inferior product. <br />"
Home,1.0,"If I could, I'd give it a zero STAR rating!","I purchased the swivel sweeper in August of 2005.  After owning it four months, it no longer works. <br /> <br />The pole broke after 2 days of usage, and the company did replace the pole; however, it took five weeks and three emails to customer service before I had a replacement pole.  The sweeper was not used for approximately one month.  Now, after three months of using the swivel sweeper, the battery will NOT hold a charge.  To replace the battery, the Ontel company charges $15 plus $6 handling/shipping, for a total of $21.  Called the corporate offices and they said that the battery is only supposed to last 3-6 months (actually, mine lasted 3 months).  Hence, to run this stupid contraption, you must be willing to spend an extra $84 a year (4 x $21) just to keep the battery going, and that doesnt even include other parts that need replacement.  Seems to me the company intentionally made a poor quality rechargeable battery so that you'd have to keep replacing it!  That is not an ethical business practice to a consumer who is on to scams like this!  Also, they say that it runs up to 45 minutes on a single charge, but after 1 month, the battery starts to fail, and after three months, the battery holds a charge for about 30 seconds and then dies! <br /> <br />I'm not replacing my battery and giving into this corporate scam! And, I'm letting everyone I know that they'd be better off finding another cordless sweeper that holds a charge! <br />"
Home,4.0,Works great  for quick pick ups,"I've been reading the other reviews on this product and was a bit surprised to see so many bad reviews because i really like mine. I agree on the battery problem. It doesn't last long while using the sweeper, about 15 min. but mine's always worked again after it's been charged. I think people need to know that it works best on carpet that is like indoor-outdoor carpet. We are in the military and are stationed in Okinawa Japan, and usually base housing never has carpet, especially here because it's a tropical island and mold is a serious issue. But we have an apt on base that is newly built and they put carpet down, but it's that kind that is  indoor-outdoor carpet, you know, no padding underneath. They just roll it out and I guess glue it down, but my swivel sweeper works so so so so wonderfully on it because of the type of carpet it is. With carpet like this, where it's real close to the ground, regular vacuums just seem to throw the stuff back at your feet because they can't reach that close to the ground. But because the swivel sweeper works the way it does, it's perfect for our house. I would have given it 5 stars but the cannister doesn't hold much and has to be emptied often but i really don't mind that. It's been a lifesaver to me with the kind of carpet i have. I've not had a problem using it on my kitchen floor either.  Hope this helps!"
Home,1.0,I loved mine at first too...  wait 3-6 months for the battery to die,"I purchased the Swivel Sweeper and loved it at first.  So darn handy, pretty powerful for a cheaply made unit.  I was happy and would have ranked it 5 stars at first...  UNTIL a couple months later when the battery failed to charge.  So I headed back to Kohls and exchanged it. <br /> <br />I was happy again, it worked great.. UNTIL 2 months later when the battery failed to charge.  What's going on?  I followed the charging instructions to the word and still it failed.  2 units.. 2 lemons.   <br /> <br />SO I am on my way to return it for good this time and as much as it kills me to do, buy a handy portable vac that I have to plug in.  I am the king of convenience and would love the Swivel if it worked, but how convenient is it when you have no power from the battery? <br /> <br />I would be curious to hear from the folks who gave this thing 4 or 5 stars.  I imagine those posts were written within a couple days or weeks of getting it.  Perhaps not, but I bet many were and now would rate it lower.... <br /> <br />Good luck."
Home,4.0,"Not a vacuum cleaner, but..","I only use my Swivel Sweeper to clean around the cat litter box and for small clean ups.  It's not like a heavy vacuum, but I didn't expect it to be.  As for the battery, I've had one for four or five months and have only had to recharge the battery once.  I just gave one to my daughter for her dorm room.  She couldn't use a vacuum because she's physically handicapped-they're just too heavy.  She loves it.  As for the price and shipping, I bought mine at Bed Bath & Beyond for about $30, with no shipping."
Home,3.0,ok...,"The first one we received literally worked for about 4 minutes, then completely died.  I feel like the replacement one is going to die in the future as well (the motor sounds like it is working way too hard), but it gets the job done for now."
Home,1.0,VERY Disappointed,"I received this product as a Christmas gift.  It worked great after the initial battery charge and I really loved it.  But, after the 2nd charge it started stopping after less than 1 minute of use.  Took it apart, cleaned all the bristles, recharged the battery, it still would not work for longer than about 30 seconds.  I sent it back.  Waited 3 weeks for a new one.  After the first charge it worked great.  But now after the 2nd charge this one won't work either!  Please do not waste your money, this product is defective."
Home,4.0,Very Handy,"A very handy device! Works great for stray cat litter, around pet bowls, stairs, and other minor messes. Works wonderful on my bathroom rug as my regular vacuum tends to suck it up and get caught. My only complaint is that it collects hair in the bristles and is a major pain to clean, but other than that it's wonderful."
Home,1.0,Thanks for sharing your reviews,"(The 1 star is going by the reviews) I was really excited to finally order something that would work great on my hard wood floors I placed an order for my swivel on Friday.  Well let me tell you that now I'm cancelling it, I should have read reviews first, boy what a disappointment to hear all the troubles and wasted money, but than again when does anything in an infomerical work.... Well reviewers thanks again for the info and for saving a hole in my pocket.  If anyone out there has a recommendation please drop me a line it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
Home,2.0,Don't waste your money,"I've had the Swivel Sweeper for 5 months now.  As stated in the other reviews, the commercial totally \\""oversells\\"" this product.  It has not broken or anything... It just doesn't do what you \\""imagine\\"" it would do based on what is presented to you on the advertisement.  It will pick up a tiny amount of material before spitting it back out in another area of your house while you continue to \\""sweep\\"" with it.  Well, when I vaccum, I let my 2 yr old play with it so she feels like she's \\""helping mommy\\"" - Other than that, it's junk."
Home,2.0,JUNK!!,"When I opened the box and saw what I was getting for $39.99 I almost fainted. What a box of junk I thought. The plastic is so fragile. First I had to put the thing together. It said the bottom piece should just slide right into the battery/power piece but it didn't. I literally needed vaseline but I didn't go that far. I really had to work hard to get it on and not to BREAK the fragile plastic on it.  <br /> <br />The dirt collector is small. When I went through the house it seemed to work well on dust and dirt. When I went to dump it the bottom was dirty and dusty, not just the actual dirt catcher. This device is just for quick use to get up dirt and cat litter and whatever else. It does not work good on my carpet though. It seems to try to work too hard.  <br /> <br />Now I don't really hate the product because it did do the job I inteded it to do. But I had to return it simply because the product is worth $10.00 max. It's a cheaply made product. A total rip off at $40 bucks. I just don't understand how these As Seen On TV companies continue to rip off the US population. We must stop buying their products until they start to bring prices to a proper range and end there \\""Get This Free\\"" (just add shipping) campaign. I recently saw an add on TV for a product that added a free item and wanted to charge $8.99 to ship the free item along with the shipping for the regular item. The total shipping ended up being $17.99 for 2 items. Please people boycott those As Seen On TV products that force extra postage for free items.  <br />(sorry, had to get that off my chest ;-}"
Home,1.0,very disappointed,"It seems that I've had the same experience as others. After owning my little sweeper for a very short time, it started cutting out all of the time. It just wouldn't hold a charge, sometimes for more than a minute! Also, the nifty little brushes around the edges do really get into corners, etc., but don't let it go near any hair! I used it on the tile floor in the bathroom, and thought I'd never get the hair cut off with their little 'seam ripper' which they include with the product. I am very disappointed in this product."
Home,5.0,Wonderful product,"I did read the reviews about this sweeper before I bought it, but the good reviews outweighed the bad.  I'm so glad I made the purchase.  It does exactly what it says it will.  I haven't had a lick of problems with it.  I use it daily for about 3-5 minutes at a time and have only had to charge it about once every two weeks or so.  It's great if you have dogs and want to keep the dog hair and dirt they track in to a minimum.  It doesn't take the place of the vacuum, but it's so convenient.  I love it..."
Home,5.0,Pets?  Swivel Sweeper a MUST,"I'm not one to write reviews but this really is a handly little sweeper. Mine was a gift for Mother's Day from one of my four children and it's the best gift I've ever gotten. We have 5 cats, a dog a parrot, all indoors and live in a 74 yr old house. Enuf said!! This Swivel picks up everything but men and money!!! It gets the dust bunnies where they stand; they don't wind up under a bed, behind a door or in another room. I can now sweep the stairs with a load of laundry under one arm and the Swivel in the other hand. It works equally well on wood floors, bathroom tile and rugs. I can run it thru the entire house on one battery charge ...but best of all, I now have time for things other than sweeping up!!"
Home,4.0,Bye bye goldfish cracker  crumbs!,"I bought this sweeper after my friend demonstrated it for me at her house. I LOVE IT! I've been using it for several months now and have never had a problem with it. I can't believe how much time it has saved me. I have a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old who are messy eaters. I no longer have to drag out the heavy vacuum or broom and dustpan. My 3-year-old LOVES to operate the Swivel Sweeper! He cleans up after every meal!<br /><br />It also picks up the tufts of dog and cat hair left on the carpet and stairs. I love the way the Swivel Sweeper turns around even the smallest chair leg. I ADORE this product.<br /><br />In fact, I would encourage everyone to purchase one for an elderly friend or relative! It's lightweight, as easy to store as a broom, and they don't have to bend over to sweep dirt into the dustpan!<br /><br />I would have given it five stars, but it IS a bear to get the hair off of the brushes, and it is a little annoying how the top gets dusty. Overall, still a FABULOUS product!"
Home,5.0,Don't overcharge!,"I LOVE this product, and can't say enough good things about it.  I purchased this product after being extremely disappointed with a more-expensive Bissell sweeper I purchased (see my review for Bissell 2800B Perfect Sweep Turbo Electric Sweeper). <br /> <br />There are numerous complaints in the reviews from people saying that their battery will no longer hold a charge.  In reading the owner's manual, there is a warning addressing the battery life: <br /> <br />\\""IMPORTANT: ...When recharging, charge time will vary dependent upon the amount of power left in the battery after its last use.  Recommended recharging time for the battery after completely depleting is 6-8 hours.  Battery may be left in charger for extended periods of time, but do NOT exceed 24 consecutive hours.  Doing so may lead to shortened overall battery life.  It is not necessary to wait until battery power is fully depleted before charging.\\"" <br /> <br />I would be willing to bet that this is the cause of the problem for many of the negative reviewers.  In their defense, the warning is somewhat buried in the manual and is fairly easy to miss.  The manufacturer of should make this warning much more visible."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper - Does what I need,"I paid entirely too much for this sweeper, but that is my own problem.  I am satisfied enough with it's performance that I won't waste my money sending it back to get a refund on it.  I DID however, purchase the extended warranty, as I know how fragile plastic objects can be, and I didn't want to be out the $$ I spent on this if it broke after a year.   <br /> <br />I have found that my sweeper does a great job of cleaning all of my hardwood and linoleum floor surfaces.  I have two small carpets that were cleaned very well with the sweeper, and I will continue using it when I need to clean.  My battery charge is just fine, and it's very lightweight, which is extremely useful as I can get my four year old to clean his room with it.  I live in an apartment, so don't have the need to get an actual vacuum cleaner since there is no real carpeting.  I run my sweeper, which takes the place of my broom and dust pan, then run my dry swiffer over it to get up the dust and lint leftover, and then run my wet swiffer over it to pick up the caked on dirt.  Seems to work well for me.  I actually cheated and bought my swiffer replica at the dollar store, so I'm not actually spending a lot of money to use though, just spent a lot to buy the sweeper vac, but that's exactly what I wanted. <br /> <br />I am overall happy with my product, all the pieces fit together fine, I just found it highly overpriced."
Home,2.0,Not worth the price,"I'd reach for my vacuum cleaner first.  While this might be okay for a quick clean up on the linoleum, all it really is is a portable dust pan.  There is no suction at all so it will pick up things on the floor surface, but the tray that the stuff goes into is minimal and requires emptying constantly.  Add that to everything that accumulates on the rollers which need to be cleaned and it's more of a pain than anything."
Home,4.0,Love my sweeper,"I have really enjoyed using this sweeper. I use it on the stairs and don't have to lug the heavy vacuum. I have found it to be effective on both human and dog hair. Because it is so light weight, yet effective, I'm buying another for my elderly Mom.  <br /> <br />Yes, it's not \\""turbo vac\\"", but does a great job in picking up almost everything."
Home,1.0,Worst customer service EVER!!,"I tried to buy a Swivel Sweeper after seeing an ad. on TV. The advertisement was two for the price of one. When I called to place my order it was an automated system to which I foolishly (and to my regret) put in all my details. (Well putting in my credit card number gave them everything they wanted to know, name, address and telephone number). Then the automated voice told me I would receive ONE Swivel Sweeper for $39.95 it was NOT as advertised on TV so I said \\""NO\\"" (it gives you that option) but then, after hanging up, I started to panic that I had submitted all this information and I wanted to make sure it had been deleted since I have already had my identity stolen once. <br /> <br />So I went to their website, I found at least three different telephone numbers for Swivel Sweeper and two for Ontel Products, I also found two ways to contact them by email.  I tried them all.  <br /> <br />\\""Customer Service\\"" is a misnomer with this company there is NONE.  <br /> <br />All the telephone numbers were either automated or no reply, that includes the Ontel office numbers as well. The emails I sent, one using an online form and the other addressed to help@ontelproducts.com received no reply.   <br /> <br />Keep away from this company..........    <br /> <br />I am very worried about the security risk and cannot help wondering how many people have access to my credit card information now."
Home,1.0,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this because of the ads on TV and a local TV station who did a bit called \\""But, does it really do that?\\""  They said it did, but it really does not.  To give an upside, it is easy and quick to use and does work on carpet.  However, on my hardwood floors all it did was blow away the crumbs and dust so that I had to go over the area again and again at different angles.  Plus, if you accidentally turn it over all of the debris inside spills out all over the floor.  Last week I got so irritated with it that I threw it out the door over the deck and it crashed in the yard in pieces and that really did feel good!!"
Home,5.0,Excellent Performance for my needs,"I have my rugs and wood floors vacuumed once per week. I bought Swivel Sweeper to keep the dark green rug in our dining room free of lint, pet fluff, and crumbs the easily make the rug look unkept. These particals stay on the top of the rug and are easy to sweep up with a brush.  That is all Swivel Sweeper is, moving brushes.  It is not a vacuum cleaner. It is only a powered floor sweeper.  I have had several other sweepers.  This one gets high marks because it removes all the surface particals and is very easy to maneuver.  It's the only sweeper I've owned that does not require moving the dining chairs to get all spaces clean.  Suggest you do as I did and buy an extra battery. That way one is always ready to go.  The batteries have given me no trouble because I remove them from the charger after 24 hours and just rotate to the sweeper.  I use the sweeper twice a day. It runs about five minutes each time. After each cleaning, I pop out the dirt tray and empty.  This is important for effective operation and takes only 30 seconds to do. I bought a second Swivel Sweeper as a gift for my syster, complete with a second battery.  She reports back giving high marks and loves the sweeper.  My family has named ours \\""squirrel-lee\\"" and the kids even like to use it. I have not had problems with the unit, but don't expect it to replace your main vacumm cleaner.  It's just for \\""touch up\\"" cleaning.  It also does a good job on my kitchen floor. Most effective getting into corners and edges.  I think it's a good unit. Thanks . . . ~SWD -- Beverly Hills, Florida"
Home,1.0,battery problems,"Perhaps I didn't dig deep enough in your site, but I can't believe I didn't read any reviews regarding this unit's battery problems. 98% of all the owner experiences I've read are the same, including mine:  works great for a few weeks then the battery dies.  You need to have a no star category in your ratings.  If there's someone out there who's had their machine for some time and it still works great, run right out and buy a lottery ticket.  If you bought your last week, hang in there and get back to me."
Home,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS,"The good:  <br />I got the Swivel Sweeper as a Christmas present and for the 1st 6 months or so, it worked great. I loved it. It was light and portable for those smaller vacuuming jobs.  <br /> <br />The bad:  <br />The handle is a bit flimsy and feels like it would break if you're not careful.  <br /> <br />After about 6 months, it stopped working. It would work for about 5 minutes and then stopped. If I turn it off and wait for a minute or so and turned it back on, it would work again for a minute and then stopped. So frustrating.  <br /> <br />The ugly:  <br />I emailed the company, Ontel, and got no response. I called them and was given the standard line of \\""Our warranty is only for 90 days. You need to contact the store you bought it from.\\"" I told them that it's been 6 months, no store was going to take it back and it was a gift. I asked if they knew about the problem since it seems to be a common problem and has been written online by other users. They said they knew but there's nothing they can do about it.  <br /> <br />Conclusion:  <br />Buy this product if you think $40 for 6 months of usage is a good deal, otherwise, save your money. The product is obviously defective and the company knows about it but won't do anything to reimburse customers and the customer service is non-existent. <br />"
Home,1.0,Sucked in by the Swivel Sweeper,"I bought a swivel sweeper as a xmas gift this past December '05. It worked fine for our needs from January until the beginning of August. We only used it moderately, maybe once every two weeks or so. We were very careful to never overcharge the battery and we periodically cleaned the brushes, etc. However, even with the proper preventive maintenance it eventually it began to cut out after a few minutes of use. If you waited for a few seconds you could get it to start again but it would continue to cut out. According to the manual it sounded as if the automatic shut-ff was engaging time after time so I made sure that the sweeper parts etc. were spotless as per the instructions. However, the problem persisted until it stopped working altogether once it was placed on any surface. The thing will still run fine if it's held up off the floor, so if you like 'swivel sweeping' the air then this is the tool for you. I called the Ontel Customer Service department to see if they would stand behind their product. I first spoke with a person named Jesse and then to someone who said she was his supervisor named Carmen. Both told me how sorry they were but that there was nothing that they could do. Then they offered to sell me another one. Oh yeah, I'll run right out and buy another swivel sweeper just as soon as I am finished waxing my Edsel. I guess you can say that the Swivel Sweeper sort of does what it says it will do: it will suck you right in.  Save your money~"
Home,1.0,Don't Purchase!,Worked great for about 2 weeks and then it broke.  Returned it and purchased another -- broke in a matter of hours!  I tossed it in the dumpster.
Home,1.0,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!! IF THERE WAS AN OPTION FOR A ZERO STAR, THAT'S WHAT I'D CHOOSE!!","POOR QUALITY PRODUCT, DO NOT BUY!!!!! THE PLASTIC GEAR INSIDE THE MOTOR STRIPPED OUT WITHIN 4 TO 5 USES. I CLEANED IT DURING AND AFTER EACH USE, SO I KNOW IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR MISUSE. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS COMPLETELY!! WHEN I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, THEY SAID I'D HAVE TO PURCHASE THE ENTIRE SWIVEL HEAD PLUS PAY SHIPPING. THAT'S NEARLY $30.00. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY, CONSIDERING IT WOULD PROBABLY JUST HAPPEN TO THE NEW HEAD. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!!   DO    NOT    BUY    THIS    PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Home,1.0,The battery is junk!,"The sweeper could be a great product if the battery was not such a piece of junk.  I would pull mine out of the charger after leaving it overnight, and it took only a few times before the battery hit the 5-minute mark for holding a charge.  Bought two sweepers, and my partner's sweeper did the same thing.  Don't buy it.  It's a rip off."
Home,5.0,A Great Sweeper,"I've bought four of these over the past year.  My father moved away and took two of them (he loved mine) and the extra one is going to be a Christmas gift for a friend.  I've been using mine for a little over a year and have not had the problems that some of the others have been experiencing.  I was going to order another one when I read all of the negative reviews on the batteries and I must admit, it made me a bit nervous.  I have not let the battery deplete completely and when I charge it, I put it in the charger before I go to bed and leave the sweeper in the kitchen to remind me to take the battery out of the outlet unit when I get up. It is in the back of my head to never leave it in the charger for 24 hrs.  I don't know if that has made the difference in the life of the battery(?) I have been very impressed with this sweeper."
Home,5.0,I must've gotten a good one!,"I love this thing. I have an 8 month old, and we're always tracking small pieces of gravel from the driveway onto \\""his\\"" living room floor.  I HATE to vacuum, and I would have to do it 2 times a day or more just to keep the floor free of the small dangerous rocks and sand.  NOT ANY MORE!   <br /> <br />    This sweeper works 10X better than the traditional carpet sweeper I spent $30 on to solve this problem.  It picks up the rocks, (the carpet sweeper did not) collects the sand, and even manages to get some of the carpet lint.  On the kitchen floor it picks up sand, rocks, cookie crumbs, and everything else my son gets on it! My traditional carpet sweeper did nothing on the linoleum!  The battery seems to last through 2-3 uses (then I just put it on the charger while I sleep), and the brushes spin a lot faster on the linoleum than the carpet.   <br /> <br />    My only problems are:  <br />You do have to empty the tray after every use (takes all of 1 minute). <br />It collects dust on the outside surface (seems to be from static electricity and wipes right off in about 10 seconds).  <br />My son loves the noise it makes and chases me around the room as I use it (it's not NEARLY as loud as a vacuum, but I WAS under the impression it should be pretty much silent).   <br /> <br />    I would buy this sweeper again in a heartbeat.  With a baby in the house, it's just SO much easier to use than the vacuum.  I haven't had the problems others seem to have had. I admit I was extremely sceptic about buying this after reading some of these reviews, however, I am completely happy with my purchase.  <br /> <br />I am glad I took the risk and bought this sweeper because it was well worth the money."
Home,5.0,SUPER little sweeper!!!,"I own one of these and I LOVE it! I don't know how anyone could write a bad review about it. It is the first small sweeper like this that will work on ANY surface - haven't seen one out there yet that will. When you empty the dirt tray, you will see that it not only picks up the obvious like pieces of dirt, food crumbs, etc. It also gets fine hairs, and also DUST, yes DUST! So it does have pretty good suction to be able to do that. The rechargebale battery easily comes off the unit, so you don't have to find a place to put the whole unit while charging. This is SO nice for in-between sweeps, and not having to pull out the monster vac everytime to do a quick pick-up or small area. Got company coming in 5 minutes? This is PERFECT for those stressful situations. Anyway, can't say enough about it. I just love it ;-)"
Home,1.0,Don't Buy,"It's a total waste of money.  First the stick broke (within first weeks of purchase), then the battery weakened (about 5 mins of charge after only 6 months of purchase). Sad thing is I would have paid more money for this product if it worked as it should have."
Home,5.0,I LOVE THIS THING!,"I LOVE MY SWIVEL SWEEPER! I have to say that I was pretty upset after reading all the bad reviews on this thing while waiting for it to arrive. I figured I got a good deal on it so if it didn't work, I didn't lose TOO much money.  <br /> <br />As soon as it arrived I plugged in the charger and let the battery charge for atleast 8 hours as recommended in the instructions. I couldn't help but see all the cat hair I had on my carpet (I have a long hair Himalayan who sheds), so I thought I'd test it out after about 9 hours went by. I was a bit concerned when I turned it on thinking, there's no way this is going to get anything out of the carpet! I was wrong, immediately I saw that it does a great job. I was under the impression that it would be pretty quiet, but it's definitely not! Then again, neither are most vacuums anyways. Not only did it get the cat hair off the carpet but it also picked up a lot of other dirt that I could barely see, as well as cat litter around the box! My cat always leaves bits of food on the floor and his food mat, so I also use this to suck it up.  <br /> <br />I have now had this sweeper for nearly a year and it still works great! The battery still holds it's charge and nothing is broken. This sweeper is just that, an ELECTRIC sweeper. If you are used to sweeping with a broom, or dust pan, this will replace that and more. Though it will never take place of your vacuum, but it will come pretty close depending on the mess. <br /> <br />The sweeper is very light and can be used in small spaces. I love that it goes under areas my vacuum doesn't. Keep in mind that most infomercials pump up their product to look better than it is. So don't have high hopes, again it WILL NOT replace your vacuum. I do feel that it should be sold for less, for those who are buying it at the full price. I recommend checking out eBay. I got mine for less than $20 (without shipping). <br /> <br />I don't understand why so many people are having trouble with theirs. Perhaps faulty pieces or not charging it properly. Overall, I definitely recommend the Swivel Sweeper. It truly comes in handy!"
Home,1.0,SHADY! The best word I can come up with to describe this company.,"I left this message as a comment to someone else. I decided this should be more visible to everyone. I am currently dealing with the issues this company caused me with my bank. PLEASE READ AND BE FOREWARNED! <br /> <br />I ordered this product and was very angry at the way they handled the order to begin with. The order was taken over the phone by a recording. AFTER they take the order for the sweeper, and your credit card information, they then begin to list the other things you should purchase for the sweeper. I kept pressing #2 to say NO, because once I saw that my order was going to go from about 40.00 + shipping up to well over 100.00 I wanted to change my mind about the entire order. THEY DID NOT GIVE ME THAT OPTION! <br />They simply said \\""thank you for your order\\"" and then the line went dead! <br />I found thier customer service number online and called them to cancel and let them know how I felt about the way the order was handled. <br />They said they cancelled my order but did not give me a confirmation number on their own, so I asked for one! Before hanging up the customer service rep. assured me that my order had been cancelled. This was on November 30, 2006. <br />Today December 16, 2006; I received an email from them that said .. my order is on its way! <br />I called my bank to find my account is overdrawn and I have an overdraft charge! <br />I then called the ontel company to complain and have them call my bank and take care of this problem at their expense, only to find that they are not doing business on saturday.  <br />I can not contact anyone until Monday, and I have to go to the bank and cover the insufficient funds for their product and shipping, plus pay 35.00 in fees to my bank. <br />I am furious.  <br />Before anyone decides to do business with these people, this is how they operate. <br />If you respond to the infomercial phone number, you will be greeted by, and your order will be taken by recording. At no time will you have an opportunity to speak with a human being.  <br />At no time will you be given the option to \\""press this number to complete the order\\"" or \\""press this number to cancel\\"" <br />They will take your order for the sweeper and then collect all the necessary billing/credit card information. <br />After they have this information secured, they will begin to let you know about the parts that will need to be replaced on the sweeper. You will have to replace the \\""plates\\"" on the sweeper. ( I do not know what these are yet since THEIR FORCED ORDER has not arrived yet) <br />They will recommend you order their batteries, and there was at least one other thing and I apologize that I can not recall what that was.  <br />My initial order was for one swivel sweeper and \\""get another one free\\"" with separate shipping charges for each one. My order was 60.91 total.  <br />Had I continued to order the pieces that would need replacing, my final costs would have been substantially higher. <br />Once you order the sweeper and give them your information, thats all she wrote. You can select NO for the additional pieces, but you CAN NOT cancel your order for the sweeper.  <br />They will simply thank you for the order and end the call for you. And about that \\""confirmation number\\"" that I requested when I cancelled my order .. When I received my email today that my sweeper is on its way! The cancellation number they gave me is actually THE ORDER NUMBER!! <br />Lousy business practices! I will never work with this company again and have warned everyone I am in regular contact with about the way they handled this. If people want to stay in business they should think about think ahead about the CUSTOMER rather than their pockets. Not enough can be said for good customer service, and this company does NOT have that! <br />Shameful."
Home,4.0,"Wow, it really works!!","I am always skeptical when I see claims about gadgets on TV. I saw this thing demonstrated on The View and decided to try it. It is very well made and has some very convenient features. The rechargeable battery provides good power and lasts a good 30 minutes before requiring a charge. The sweeper picks up just about anything but sometimes spits items back out. The segmented handle stays together well and is strong enough for the job. I would have liked to have seen a feature on the battery charger that lets you know when the battery is fully charged. All-in-all, a great gadget at a fair price that really works!"
Home,5.0,I LOVE it!!!!!,"I tell people every time I use it (4 x a day +) that I could not have a baby w/o my swivel sweep! It is SO handy and quick and picks up almost anything: from whole crackers to small chunks of stuff, etc. The battery can do about 2 whole rooms and then it dies, so my husband and I just slip it off each time and stick it in the charger. Takes two extra seconds and it's always ready to go!  <br /> <br />I have never had one problem and I've had it for over a year and used it every day! <br /> <br />If mine ever breaks...I'm def. buying a new one!!! I LOVE this  <br />thing!!!"
Home,3.0,"WORK GREAT, BUT BATTERY IS AWFUL","I LOVE THIS SWEEPER!, VERY LIGHT AND CONVENIENT.  I HARDLY USE MY FULL SIZE VACUME NOW.  HOWEVER AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF WEEKLY USE, THE BATTERY NO LONGER HOLDS IT CHARGE.  I NOW NEED TO BUY A NEW BATTERY. <br />"
Home,1.0,Same thing - worked initially and now doesn't,"I don't know if it is the sweeper or the battery, probably the battery, but after a short period of use it does not work at all.  The brushes were cleaned.  There is no logical reason for it to not work.  I am very disappointed in this product."
Home,3.0,Swivel Sweeper,"Overall, a helpful product.  Good battery life so far.  Easy to empty dirt tray and completely take apart if needed.  Works well on area rugs for a quick pickup but avoid fringe.<br /><br />CONS - you have to sweep 'really fast' on bare floors or the motion of the sweeper brushes blows the dust or dirt away before you can grab it.  That's a problem in my book.<br /><br />Also it grabs small cords like telephone line and tangles into the brushes.  So avoid them."
Home,4.0,great product,I bought this and have been more than pleased with it-- very light and easy to use -- my kids even love to use it-- my only complaint is that I do seem to have to clean the beater bars of strings and hair too often
Home,1.0,Zero stars!! Company doesn't stand behind their product!,"This could be a wonderful product but the rechargable battery is a very big problem. Like so many others who have written reviews, I have had problems with the battery not holding a charge in a sweeper that is less than six months old. Calling the company does absolutely no good so don't even bother.Both the rep and her supervisor told me that because they are not the manufacturer,they cannot offer any guarantee at all for the battery - BUT that they will replace it,if I pay for it. In other words, I have to buy a new one!! This is definitely a fly-by-night outfit so save your money by not buying a product that the company won't even stand behind."
Home,5.0,"Love it, love it, love it!","I have now had my swivel sweeper(s) for over a year (got it for Christmas in 2005).  I immediately bought another one to have at the cabin.  I have not had a problem with the battery.  I use it pretty much daily.  If mine ever dies, I will definitely replace it with a new one.  I paid about $35 for it, and as far as I'm concerned, I have gotten my money's worth. <br /> <br />Keep in mind it's a sweeper, not a vacuum.  Yes, you will still need to vacuum and wash your floors.  We have a very large kitchen and I use it all the time to go around the edges and under the stools at the island to sweep up crumbs, dust bunnies, etc.  It works like a charm and I no longer have to get down on my hands and knees to wipe up with a rag.  LOVE IT!  RECOMMEND IT!"
Home,5.0,Love it!,I've only had this for about two weeks but we've used it every day (sometimes several times a day).  Does exactly what we bought it for.  Perfect for quick clean ups after dinner and just for general sweeping in the kitchen and on our hardwood floors.  This product is a real time saver and a MUST have for parents of little ones.  I actually ENJOY using it - even my five year old likes to sweep with it.  No trouble with the battery yet.  It does say in the instructions not to keep the battery in the charger for more than 24 hours at a time or it will deplete the battery life.  I've been extra careful about that just because of the previous reviews.  I wouldn't really recommend this for carpeting because it definitely doesn't do the same job.  But for hard floors you've got to have this!
Home,5.0,the little sweeper that could,"This is exactly the kind of tool I've been needing in my cleaning arsenal. It works nicely like a swiffer, with its pivoting head and lightweight design, however where the swiffer fails, this little device takes over nicely. It tackled the mess of being a rabbit owner--loose fur, hay and little turds--very nicely without scaring the rabbit. The moderate noise of the motor is a nice alternative to the deafening decibals of a standard vacuum. It also picked up lint and dust very close to the edge of the baseboards. For my hardwood floors, this is a really great sweeper. Ultimately, it's a replacement for vacuuming, swiffering and washing my floors, but for a moderate sweep up, it's much easier than a broom, tons easier to manuever than the corded vacuum."
Home,1.0,Works pretty good but lousy battery!,We really liked this when we first got it.  Then we noticed after a couple of months it would not hold a charge.  I no longer had the receipt so I couldn't even bring it back to the store. <br /> <br />It would be great if it weren't for the battery.  We never overcharged it either - just a bad addition to what would've been a good product.
Home,2.0,Broke down,"The sweeper worked very well on the wooden floors for awhile, then it broke down because of dust inside the rods that make the sweepers turn.  I had cleaned the whole thing out twice but now it just doesn't turn at all anymore.  I've tried everything except replace the drive motor."
Home,2.0,High expectations,"This product is cheaply made therefore it's overpriced.  The Swivel Sweeper infomercial offers free \\""RUSH\\"" delivery.   It's a good thing it does, because my rush delivery took more than three weeks to reach my home address.  <br />   I wish the best of luck to new owners."
Home,2.0,very light but very flimsy,"I have had my sweeper for several months and found it to be handy for cleaning up bird seed around my parrot cages.  However, it does not suck up bird feathers. <br />I liked it because it is light.  However, the casing is flimsy and has broken.  I plan to replace it with something more sturdy."
Home,4.0,Love this product,I've had this sweeper for about 6 months. I haven't had any problems with the battery or the handle. I've seen complaints about both in reviews. This product does not replace a vacumn or good old fashion broom and mop. Its a great quick pick up. The handle and pole are not made of the strongest material but anything else would make this product heavy and cumbersome. With normal use neither the handle or pole should present a problem. I have two cats and this works wonders to do quick pickups of the kibble bits by their food bowl. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a product for quick sprucing. The product does not replace general cleaning with a vacumn.       Edit: Shortly after writing this review this unit stopped working and was thrown in the trash. It has since been replaced with something different that has outlasted it. This is too expensive to need replacing in so short of time. Amazon won't let me reduce the stars I'd give this a 2 1/2
Home,5.0,Best thing ever,"I have a small apt. and two cats...  This machine works great; it gets just about all the cat hair off the tiled kitchen floor, and all the cat litter!  It does pick up most stuff off the carpet, but it can't replace a vacuum.  Bottom line, if you hate sweeping then this is the machine for you.  It does a better job then I can with a broom, but takes half the time.  It's light and easy to maneuver around furniture, and even gets under the kitchen table with out me having to move all the chairs.  It has made sweeping the kitchen floor a tortured job of the past.  Do be cautious though, their are specific directions for recharging the batter pack.  If you over charge the battery, it shortens the battery life, so you can't just leave the thing on the charger when you're not using it.  All in all a great buy and worth every cent."
Home,3.0,I'd pay twice as much for a sturdy version,"This does an amazing job sweeping.  My kids love it, so they sweep after meals.  This is all good.  The problem is the quality is so low as to render the sweeper disposable. <br /> <br />If the same mechanism was built by Leifheit, or some other quality brand, this sweeper would rock.  As it is, I can't see buying a new one every 3-4 months for $30 a pop."
Home,5.0,You can do a clean sweep with this!!,This is a really great product. We've had it for a few months and use it all the time. I recomment rechaging the battery only when it runs down. It should last for long time that way. It does eveything that it is claimed to do. We're thinking of getting one for our mothers.
Home,5.0,Great tool,This is a great household tool. I have had this sweeper for over a year and am back to order another one for downstairs. It does a fantastic job picking up kitty litter. I would recommend it for anyone with a kitty litter box. I ordered it with an extra battery and haven't had any problems with either battery or durability of the sweeper but I only use it for little jobs and use a vacuum for overall cleaning. Great tool for the price.
Home,3.0,Good but....,"The product is handy for small jobs and pick ups but the battery has a short life and hard to find and expensive. Follow battery care instructions and before the original dies shop for replacement or buy a new one on sale, which would be cheaper.  The concept is great and wish the materials used were of better quality and the batteries cheaper."
Home,4.0,"SWIVEL 'SWEEPER"" IS JUST THAT","After seeing the swivel sweeper infomercial on TV I thought I would give it a whirl.  I have a fairly large home with many pets and a wonderful central vacuum to clean it with on a 2 to 3 times a week basis.  What I needed was something small to use for quick clean ups in between serious vacuuming.  I charged the sweeper the full 8 hours and gave it a whirl.  What I noticed at first was that the sweeper seems to operate with no suction whatsoever.  Yet it \\""swept\\"" all surface dirt up with ease. It is in no way, however, to be considered a vacuum cleaner.  It will NOT deep clean your carpets.  It does do a wonderful job of cleaning even fairly large items off the surface of the carpets and floors though.  If you are looking for a sweeper for light but thorough \\""quick\\"" cleaning the swivel sweeper delivers."
Home,3.0,"Great product, bum battery","I have had my swivel sweeper for about 4 months now and I love it.  It does all it says it will do.  My 7 year old son begged to do the sweeping for me!  When the battery would no longer hold a charge, I called the customer service line and asked what to do.  She told me that the battery is only designed to last six months.  So, keep in mind when you are purchasing this item, you will spend $[...]+ $[...] s/h each six months on a new battery.  Like I said, I love the swivel sweeper, but I'll be using my vacuum from now on which only sucks dirt, not my pocketbook!"
Home,5.0,Good product,"I usually do not buy As Seen On TV products, but I thought that this was such a good idea that I would give it a try.  I have certainly not been disappointed. The sweeper takes 8 hours to charge the first time, gives you 45 minutes to get your sweeping done and is very easy to empty when full.  It easily manuevers around chairs and under furniture as well.  I highly recommend this product as one of the few As Seen On TV items that actually works and is worth the money."
Home,4.0,Great Little Sweeper,"This is a great sweeper.  It should be remembered that this is an electric sweeper and not a vacuum, so if you are looking for a vacuum, this may not be for you.  But if you are looking for a sweeper, this one top notch.  It really gets under and around everything.  So far, the battery has given me several uses before requiring recharing, but I don't like that it can overcharged and gives no indication of when to stop charging it.  I set a timer and keep my fingers crossed that I am not overcharging it and thus ruining it.  I wish they had charged a little more for the unit and upgraded the battery, but I would still buy another of these even with this limitation.  Living in a northern climate where so much gravel and dirt are tracked in during the winter and spring, I find that we are picking up the floor-damaging dirt much more often.  This is because the SS is so convenient that we get it out quite often.  And as an added bonus, my almost 9-year old son loves using it, so I have been able to nag a bit less about his chores that involve sweeping.  I thought about buying this for years, but have been burned by these TV vacuums before and was hesitant.  I'm glad I took a chance on this one."
Home,2.0,Seam Ripper???,"I would normally give this product 1 star but it did pick up everything so I gave it 2; however, when I got my Swivel Sweeper I couldn't figure out why they included a seam ripper.  After reading the instructions it stated to use it to clean the brushes...OK not a problem.  Well I have two long hair cats and every thing I just swept up got caught around the brushes.  I took me 3 times as long to clean the brushes than it did to sweep the house.  I bought this to save me some time...what a joke!"
Home,5.0,Swivel Lover!,"I love my swivel sweeper! I bought the two pack for $19.99 each plus shipping and handling from the main website which I think was $14.99 total. So overall I had gotten two for around $60. This thing does every thing the company says it does even though I think it's a bit pricy. I am so pleased with it! If you want it made right,go to their website. I've had mine for 3 months and gave the other one to my parents. My dad loves it and has taken over the vacuuming for my mom! My mom loves their old vacuum but she always wanted an upright cordless, now she has one.     When I say this thing does what the company says it will this means I've tried every thing the commercial says and it lives up to the commercial's garantee. This thing even picks up:    *Cat hair  *Kitty litter  *Kitty food (my cats are messy eaters)  *Small pieces of paper  *String (although if it's too long it'll bind up in the gears. It'll switch off automatically at a certain point. Then all you do is pull out the string then turn it on and keep on going.  *Dirt/Dust Bunnies (duh)  *Some different types of cereals (cheerios), etc.  *Food crumbs    You need to clean out the compartment after every two or three rooms because the only downside is it's a small compartment to hold the crap it collects. But it's easy to dump out and snap together and keep on going! My house is 1,000 sq foot so I can wait till I'm done with 90% of the house then clean out the tray. It's very easy to do.    Just do not forget to put it back on the charger for up to 8 hours. I've had mine for 3 months and love it still! My dad loves theirs and he asked his best friend and he said he has his for two years now and still loves it. Also, if you over charge it you'll wear out the battery, I haven't done this yet but I read up on it first before I bought mine. If you use it enough you'll know when it needs to be charged up again. The gears start slowing down to a hault fast.    This isn't a girly vacuum, it's for guys too!"
Home,1.0,Very Disappointed,"I bought this sweeper about a year ago.  At the beginning I was very pleased with it.  I bought it for those quick pick-ups in the bathroom and kitchen, so I wasn't expecting it to work like a big vaccuum cleaner.  Worked great.  After using it maybe 4 or 5 times, I noticed that the battery would not hold a charge for very long.  Now it won't hold a charge at all.  I charged it according to the instructions and never over-charged it.  I wrote the company twice and to date have not received any reply and that has been 2 months ago."
Home,4.0,gimme a break......its a 'as seen on tv' product!,"Update 1 year later;  believe what everyone is saying about the battery...it does not last and will not hold a charge after a few months of normal use....and the rollers are a complete pain to clean...don't let them go too far or you will never get them cleaned out totally!!<br /><br />After reading several reviews I was still compelled to purchase the product!  And after one use I was not totally disappointed.  Granted I did not expect too much from it, it surprisingly performed amazingly well.  And the better news is that it seemed to work better the 2nd and 3rd time!  I don't know how.  I have 3 dogs, 2 large and one small but they are always bringing mud and dirt into the house and on the furniture.  I have several throw rugs thru-out the house also.  I found that the Swivel Sweeper had just enough power to pick up (fluff up) my throw rugs without eating them as my regular vacumn does.  I did not have any problems picking up dirt or having it throw it around the floor.  I think if you take your time it will pick up the larger items....just like sweeping with a broom, you want to take your time!  Another trick I found is that if you DON'T clean the rollers the dirt won't get thrown out either...there is more gunk to hold it in the sweeper!!!  I have sheets thrown over my sofa and bed for the dogs and again it has just enough power to get the dirt but not eat the sheets.  Overall I am satisfied with the product...I usually am gentle with my appliances so I don't forsee the handle breaking as mentioned in some reviews.  I found it to be just as or more sturdy than a typical Swifter brand.  I just hope the battery makes it to 6 months as suggested."
Home,1.0,Ineffective product for hardwood floors,"I have been very disappointed in the swivel sweeper due to the fact that it kicks up an enormous amount of dust as it vacuums.  I need to sweep or vacuum my hardwood floors daily (two dogs, two cats), and if I use the swivel sweeper, I also have to dust the entire house.  Even a normal broom generates less dust than this thing.  So all in all, it has not saved me any time or inconvenience.  It's overpriced as well when you add in the exorbitant shipping charges."
Home,4.0,"Great, light-use sweeper for hardwood/tile floors.","I bought the sweepers using the 2 for 1 offer from [...] website, one for us and one for our parents. We have a hardwood floor kitchen with 2 kids to mess it up, and we end up scooping about half a cup of junk from floor every day. My parents love to cook and end up generating same amount of garbage on the floor.      Ever since we bought the swivel sweepers, our floors have been decently clean. The sweeper does a decent job, and is extremely light - many times, my kids, as soon as they spill something on the floor, clean the mess by themselves. We also have a extra heavy marble top dining table and moving it to clean was out of question - the sweeper goes under it and cleans the rug thoroughly.      My sweeper came with a bad battery - after 1 use, it would not charge. I called SwivelSweeper support, and a new battery was shipped immediately - no questions asked. The rep was courteous enough to offer me a charger also, but I declined as I believed the problem was with the battery, not charger.      My advise to users is to empty the cup immediately - the cup is small, and when you turn it upside down with a full cup, many times, the contents came out. In addition, I have experienced spillage when I go from hardwood floor to rugs. Moreover, it is hygenic too, to empty it.     So folks with difficult-to-maintain hardwood / tile floors, give your backs a break and buy this. This will be a great investment. Keep in mind that this is not supposed to replace your normal high-powered vacuum; this is a very delicate vacuum, and I doubt if the handle or sweeper head will withstand the load from vacuuming a carpet."
Home,1.0,negative stars,I bought this wwivel sweeper and they charged me monthly fees for signing up for something that I never did. It cost me over $160 for these monthly fees. Do not I say do not buy thgis product or they will do the same thing to you.
Home,4.0,Works as shown on commercial!,"This has worked out well for us. It works as well as seen on TV. It is quite amazing what it picks up. I bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon, so the price was OK. It does a great job on my linoleum floors and the floors are cleaner than when I used a broom. It by no means could replace a vacuum, but it does get up quite a bit on carpet. I use it regularly and have yet to have problems. I particularly like how I can clean small rugs that my vacuum could not do without sucking them up. I gave it four stars on account of hearing that the battery only lasts 6 months....but that really is the only problem."
Home,4.0,Very practical but low quality,The sweeper is very practical and does the work as they promises on TV. <br />But (and this is big significant but) the charger and battery are made with low quality electric materials. <br />My charger was burned after one use and seems that the butteries will not keep much longer. <br />It is very sad and pity because the idea is brilliant. <br />So my suggestion is wait for a better model. <br />
Home,4.0,Had High Hopes - And I'm Not Disappointed!,"Of the many 'gadgets' that fall under the ASOTV label, I have been most intrigued by the Swivel Sweeper and decided that I just had to have it. <br /> <br />I received it today... and it is impressive! After the initial charge, I ran it through some tests like kitty litter (no sweat), pergo and tile floors (A+), and versatility (very nimble and convenient).  <br /> <br />David S's review is perfect and I echo his sentiment of wondering why there are so many bad reviews. This isn't a replacement for a vacuum cleaner and shouldn't be treated as such. You know what? Neither are the Roomba and the Euro-Pro Shark (by the way, the EPS is also a very good product but not as agile as the SS). <br /> <br />David S also makes a good point that I agree with: the SS is oversold on TV. You will need to clean the brushes frequently. In doing so, I was amazed at how much carpet fuzz this gathered. Furthermore, despite it's on-air claims, this is not a vacuum. It is an electric, cordless floor sweeper meant to be used for the quick clean-ups between major vacuumings. <br /> <br />Here are some recommendations to make the most of this: <br /> <br />* When sweeping, move the SS in an 'S-like' fashion -- much like how they mop in the Navy. This will allow the brushes to push/pull/spin at the utmost advantage for cleaning. <br /> <br />* Tape the 'cleaning tool' to the pole so that it's nearby when needed. <br /> <br />* Haven't done so yet, but I hypothesize that spraying Static Guard on the brushes may be advantageous in keeping excess dust and 'knap' off the brushes. <br /> <br />Go ahead and buy it if your curiosity is getting the better of you. Follow the advice and expectations of this and other positive reviews and you'll be pleased."
Home,3.0,Good product for its price,"I have the swivel sweeper for a month and found it satisfatory considering its price.  Don't expect too much for just $35 product.  I replaced my old, heavy, noisy, and dysfunctional vaccum with this swivel sweeper.  It is very light in weight and easy to use compare to my old one; however, the suction is not as powerful as advertised.  It can do the basic but not the toughest job.  With the price, I'm happy with the job it can do so far."
Home,5.0,I love this product!!!,This swifter is very easy to hide away and then quickly take it out and clean up. Its rotating head is the best feature. Strong durable. My Mom saw this and had to go and buy one. My Dad loves it to!
Home,3.0,"not bad, but scratches floors","this is really great for what it is (not a vacuum, i.e. no suction), but great for in between cleaning.  i like it especially for the hard floors (linolium), but it does leave scuffy marks on my floor, like drag marks, not exactly scratches (i hope), due to the plastic of the sweeper rubbing on the floor.  it's not so great with carpet. <br />-dianna"
Home,1.0,Cheap sweeper,"I was very disappointed in this sweeper.  I actually got very lucky, because the day it came my sister in law was here and she told me that she has the same sweeper and she uses it for her tile floors.  So she ran over and got it for me to try so I didn't have to open up my new one that I had just received.  I tried hers and it worked o.k. on the vinyl floors but as soon as I tried to go on carpet runners or into my living room, it wanted to flip over. It wouldn't pick up anything on the carpet.  If you are using it for just hardwood or vinyl floors , would be o.k.  But definately no good for any kind of carpet, even if the carpet is low.  I have a Shark sweeper #610 and love that sweeper compared to this one.  The Shark goes on anything, even my living room carpet."
Home,1.0,Worthless after too short a time,"Like many others, I found out only after buying this crappy product, that the battery only has a short life.  The whole thing worked great when I first got it - hard surface floors, carpets, light weight, easy to use.  I was always very careful to only leave the battery plugged in the charge no longer than directed.  Even so, after just a month or two, the thing has died.  It'll hold a charge for no more than a few minutes.  It would get five stars with a working power source.  As is, it's a complete waste of money and is going in the garbage."
Home,1.0,Don't waste your money,"At first it works great, but it doesn't hold much.  Get's edges great but I got frustrated with it after about 1 month.  Not good with high volume vaccuming... starts spitting things out and not great suction.  Pain in the you-know-what to clean to make work well."

Home,5.0,Very Useful Swivel Sweepers,"We are very happy with the performance of the Swivel Sweepers. No problem getting up tracked in dirt, crumbs on the kitchen floor and under the table. The sweepers are very handy and easy to use. The battery stays charged for several uses. A very smart buy."
Home,4.0,Daughter of 83 year old Mom,"The swivel sweeper is great!!  My Mom is 83 years old with alot of back problems, and she is able to clean her own hard floors.  It is light and easly moves in and out from under her chairs and dinning area.  She loves it, and it has given her more independence.  I have a cat that lives indoors, and I can't believe the amount of little hair it gets up on my tile floors.  I have never used it on carpet, just hard floor so I don't know if it works as well on carpet.  I give it a BIG thumbs up!!"
Home,1.0,Not What You'd Expect,"This sweeper can only pick up a little bit of dust and dirt at a time.  The area containing the dirt is no bigger than a deck of cards.  That means that if you have pet hair, you can only make a swipe or two before it is full and you need to empty it.    It may just be me, but I expected this to have some suction or something. It does not.  The battery powers the brushes and that is all.    I didn't feel that it picked up well and I was just using it to run over our hard wood floors each night.    I ended up returning the item.  I thought it was junk."
Home,1.0,Disappointing,"Wouldn't it be great if things really worked like they do in the advertisements?  This little sweeper seemed like a good idea, but it just didn't work."
Home,1.0,Waste of money--and time,"If you own pets, absolutely positively do not waste your money buying this.  They claim it picks up long hair and fur.  Well yeah, but then you spend much time trying to disengage the fur from the wheels and the brush portions.  By the time I get enough fur pulled off to make the wheels work again, I could've saved myself a lot of time and effort just getting out a real vacuum that actually has suction power.  I was going out of my way to try to pick up the fur by hand, before using the sweeper, and just wanted to at least pick up crumbs/dirt.  It has to be recharged each time it's used, so I have to think ahead to use it.  Of course, now I don't bother.  My mother was so excited when she first got hers, she sold several of us on this item.  I have found that due to battery problems, theirs have all been sent to the trash, too.  If I had to do all over, I would not waste money on this product.  (And, as most people only  like this item for a short time, you wouldn't  want to buy a \\""used\\"" one, although I'm sure a lot of us would love to sell you ours!)  It isn't worth even one star."
Home,3.0,So-So,I purchased this after watching the infomercial.  At first it was great picking up from all sides and battery seemed to be lasting for a long time.  I have all wooden floors in my house and it was nice and easy to use.  All of a sudden the battery would not hold a charge and the handle began twisting and coming loose.  It just doesnt seem to work as shown on the tv or as stated.  I have had mine now 6 months and the last month has been not so good.
Home,5.0,Love this little Sweeper,"Being disabled and not so young anymore  it's so much easier to use than a broom in the kitchen and bath.And does pick up rather well on carpeting in other rooms. I  use it every day and now only have to drag out my big vacuum cleaner about once a week. And around my computer desk which is also carpeted it works great!  I bought mine from the infomercial on TV, getting 2. And now plan yo get 2 more to keep in other rooms of the house always ready and waiting to go. But think I'll get the new ones from Amazon. Saving nyself a couple bucks."
Home,5.0,"Excellent product, picks up everything !","I have had the Swivel Sweeper for several months now and use it practically everyday to clean up my hardwood kitchen floor after the kids. It works like a charm, it picks up crumbs, cat hair, little pieces of paper, cheerios, dust, you name it. I was skeptical at first from reading these reviews, but i tried it for myself and it really does a great job! It beats having to take out the big vacuum or the broom and dustpan. The only complaint I have, which is minor, is that the outside of the sweeper gets super dusty, but it you take a wet cloth it cleans right up. The dustpan is easy to take on and off and the battery holds a charge no problem, just be sure to charget it overnight.  I defintely recommend this product to anyone who has small kids and is constantly cleaning their kitchen floor! I would say it works better on hard floors than on carpet, but still worth buying."

Home,5.0,Great Quick Clean Up- CHARGE CORRECTLY,"This does a great quick clean up on hardwood and pergo floors.  Not too good on carpet, but that is what a real vacuum is for!  This does awesome for quick jobs around the house, under the table, in the kitchen, etc.  So light the toddlers can use it too and really be vacumming!  I highly reccomend this as an affordable lightweight easy clean sweeper!      MAKE SURE TO CHARGE IT RIGHT.  IF YOU DO NOT YOU WILL HAVE A PROBLEM."
Home,2.0,"This vacuum ""doesn't suck...""","I previously owned a Bissel Go Vac and loved it. Eventually, the battery wouldn't hold enough of a charge so I had to look for a new cordless for quick clean-ups. I bought this and unfortunately it didn't fit the ticket.<br />Some good points: it is very lightweight, it moves very easily and gets close to edges. The battery holds a good charge and it doesn't need to stay plugged in so it can be stored anywhere.<br />The bad points: It has absolutely no suction. The vacuum works by rotating brushes, NOT suction power. Therefore, it leaves a lot behind. It was poor on flat surfaces as it kicked up more that it picked up. Additionally, if you tilted the head by accident, it would spit out anything that it had vacuumed up.<br />I would not recommend this product.<br />I have since purchased an Electrolux Pronto with a built in mini-vac and I really like it.<br />Needless to say, I've tried to sell my old Swivel at a really cheap price and no one is calling..."
Home,2.0,I really wanted to like this product,"For the first 4 months I thought this product was a dream. I liked the fact that it was very light weight, great for quick pickups after meals. Then the problems started. First the battery lost its gusto, would only hold a charge for maybe 15 minutes. Next one of the clips on the top broke off. Then when the pole broke and there were wires showing I decided it was time to let it go. I am very sad at the failures of this product, I REALLY wanted to love it!"
Home,5.0,I love this product!,"It's now Sept. 16th 2008 and I still love it!<br /><br />Another thing I learned is to use the device included to clean the brushes.  I thought mine was needing to be charged too often, but it just turned out that the brushed needed cleaning.  Funny though, with a new charge, even with a ton of hair in the brushes, it still worked.  Now I clean the brushes a bit more regularly.<br /><br />I've had my sweeper for three months now and I am just thrilled!  It's great for kid messes in between regular vacuuming.  I'm going to get one for all of my family for Christmas.  It's great on my wood floor and carpet.  It will bog down a bit on the carpet when the battery charge is getting low, but that is easily remedied with a recharge.  Just remember DO NOT OVERCHARGE the battery."

Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper:  some product details.,"This clever little sweeper has 4 rapidly rotating brushes: front and rear plus one on each side.  The motor drives the rear brush, and since they are all mechanically linked, they all spin at once.  The low profile unit is 9.5 by 5.5 inches and it fits easily under cabinet toe spaces.  The bits of material it picks up stay trapped in the tray that is very easy to remove to empty.  The kitty hair that gets wrapped around the bristles is easy to pull off by grasping it between thumb and forefinger. (The included seam ripper/stitch cutter tool may speed up that process, but I seldom use it.)<br /><br />I have been using my Swivel Sweeper for two years and have absolutely no complaints.  I think it is one of the very best &#34;As Seen On TV&#34; products.<br />I use a timer to charge the 7.2 volt NiMH battery for seven hours to get about two or more weeks of<br />daily use per charge.  The &#34;gimble&#34; style swivel attachment to the handle make it a real pleasure to guide around the floor.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this is not a substitute for a vacuum cleaner, but I have great success using it on our light colored vinyl kitchen floor and on the adjoining family room carpet.  I am able to keep up with the fir needles and other debris tracked in by the two kitties (one 15 pound Maine Coon with BIG feet and a very long hair domestic).<br /><br />I have found this sweeper to be a real improvement over the Hokey manual carpet sweeper I used to use, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*********UPDATE********<br /><br />August 7, 2010:  Recently I thought this original type Swivel Sweeper was starting to fail on me, since it slowed down soon after a  battery charge.  I ordered a replacement battery, but in the mean time I gave it a thorough cleaning  and LUBRICATION. At the plastic ends of all the rotary brush shafts where they are attached to the corner couplings and at the center main power coupling, I sprayed some teflon/silicone &#34;dry&#34; lubricant (several brands available at hardware and home improvement stores).  Now the sweeper runs faster and longer after a charge.t stores).  Now the sweeper runs faster and longer after a charge."
Home,4.0,I threw out my broom and dustpan!,"I first bought a swivel sweeper about a year ago. I love this product! I've bought several as gifts and everyone loves it (even my \\""hard to buy for\\"" dad). One battery charge lasts quite a long time. I probably charge my battery less than once a month and I use the sweeper almost every day. It really does swivel in every direction making it easy to sweep almost anywhere. Both of my children (ages 5 and 3) enjoy using it as well. My son loves to sweep around the house and then see how much dirt he has picked up. As a mom of little ones and a dog, I love that it sucks up cheerios, goldfish and dogfood with no problem. Living in New England without a mudroom, I've found it also comes in handy for picking up gravel, leaves and other such messes. If you have a short-haired pet like I do it is awesome at picking up pet hair. I'm always amazed at how much dog hair I pick up every day. I don't have any plush carpets in my house so this sweeper works on all of my floor surfaces (tile, linoleum, berber-type carpet). I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because my first one did die after 1 year. However, I'm pretty sure it was user error. If you have a long hair or a long haired pet you do have to make sure to clean the brushes in case there is hair wrapped around them. There is a tool that comes with it to do this and it works pretty well. My hair is long now and I wasn't paying attention to the brushes. I got a lot of hair wrapped around them and the sweeper \\""choked up\\"". I fixed it temporarily, but it died shortly after. As the title of my review states, I did actually get rid of my regular broom (it may be in the garage somewhere) so after a few days of dirty floors I went out and bought another swivel sweeper because it cleans much better than a broom with less effort. Some reviewers have said that their battery stopped charging. I never had this problem, but I have had other rechargable products that have done this. It's a fairly common problem. Overall, if you're looking for an easy way to clean your floors - you'll love this product. Some online merchants will tell you that this sweeper is not sold in stores, but that's not true. You can purchase it at Linens N Things or Bed, Bath and Beyond. Both stores frequently send out 20% off coupons (they will always take them,even if expired) so you can get the sweeper for less than $30 with the coupon."
Home,5.0,A great quilling book,I owned quite a few quilling books and this book is near the top of my list. It has a wide selection of patterns for framed as well for cards. It is a 'must have' book. Well worth the money.
Home,5.0,good product,"I've bought 3 of these for my 2 daughters and myself and we all love it.  It will not replace your heavy duty vacuum but you wil be glad to have it handy to use for quick daily cleanups. It's surprisingly effective,it does get into the corners and edges like the big machine can't."
Home,4.0,No Major Complaints,I have no major complaints about the swivel sweeper.  I use my in place of my broom on the kitchen floor.  I have had no problems from the battery. I have had the swivel sweeper for over a year.  I also got my sister one and she still uses hers.  I just do not like having the clean the sweepers.  That takes a lot of time and makes a mess.  Other than that I have no complaints about the product.  I would buy again.
Home,1.0,Swindled by the Swivel Sweeper,What a piece of junk. I purchased this through BB&B for use on my new hardwood floors and it worked great the first 3 times or so I used it. Then the battery would start dying after 5-10 minutes of use despite the fact that it had been charging for days. I no longer had the receipt/box to return the item. I emailed Ontel directly and never heard from them. Please save your money and buy something that will work for many many years to come rather than days.
Home,1.0,Don't Waste Your Money,"For $20, I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but at $35, it's a piece of junk. Battery charge lasted for less than five minutes, and it didn't pick up dirt very well. Boo!"
Home,5.0,An Indispensible Product,"I have found the swivel sweeper to be an absolutely indispensible tool.  I don't use a standard vacuum or broom and dust pan any longer.  The Swivel Sweeper does everything that I need:  cleaning hardwood and tile floors (it doesn't work on carpets unless there is no nap).  There is nothing like it for cleaning up cat litter that gets out of the cat box.  I used to use a mini vac for this purpose, but Swivel Sweeper cleans effortlessly.    The 360-degree rotating head gets virtually anywhere.  The handle can be 90 degrees vertical to 0 degrees horizontal (e.g., for getting under beds effortlessly).  The sweeper gets right up to walls and even in corners.  It gets behind toilets and all the other places that a regular vacuum would be too big for.  The Swivel Sweeper is light and effortless.    Putting the Swivel Sweeper together out of the box is simplicity itself.  Snap a few parts into place and voila!  It takes about 60 seconds.  The rechargeable battery lasts almost an hour and recharges fully in about 8 hours with the supplied charger (not rechargeable batteries to buy).  You don't have to worry about finding outlets to plug into and dragging that inconvenient vacuum AC cord everywhere you go.    The Swivel Sweeper comes with a little tool that you can use to pick threads and such like out of the brushes if you need to.  In normal use, if you avoid carpets, you shouldn't even have to do this.  I would not recommend avoiding using the Swivel Sweeper on wet debris (like wet cat litter).  This can get on the brushes and cake things up.  As long as you keep to dry clean-up, you shouldn't have any problem at all.    I can't recommend this product highly enough.  There is just nothing like it for easily and quickly cleaning up on any surface except carpets.  It easily cleans in places that no vacuum would ever get to.    UPDATE.  I have found that the manufacturing of these swivel sweepers is unreliable.  I had one Swivel Sweeper, which worked fine for a couple of years.  Then the motor started cutting in and out.  I ordered another, and it suffered the same problem after two months.  Unfortunately, AsSeenOnTVGuys does not replace defective products after 15 days, so if you get a defective one, you will not be able to get a free replacement.    UPDATE.  I have purchased three of these swivel sweepers now.  The rechargeable battery seems to be a weak point.  I have had them lose power anywhere from a month to a year, after which the recharge works only for a couple of minutes."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She has had one for several years and loved it.  Says it is wonderful.  Her old one broke and needed repair.  She felt lost without it and asked for a new one for Christmas!!
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper,Great on wood floors; not as good on my rug. Still an excellent product well worth the cost.
Home,5.0,Super Swivel Sweeper Sensational!!!,"This is not a \\""vacumm\\"" this is a quick pick me up tool that is FUN to use and EASY!!! This holiday season was a breeze picking up the fallen evergreen leaves from the tree, small bits of syrofoam, paper, hair, dried mud, dried food, crumbs of all sorts, even paper thin onion skins! I ordered the swivel sweeper from the info mercial...it was every bit as good, no it was better than the commercial.  This will not do deep down cleaning ...it cleans up everything thats dropped and its fast and light...I have 2 one upstairs and one down...my husband tried it and he wants one for his office... it empties easy -pops out and dumps tray contents in trash. It glides on small plastic casters and has 4 brushes that catch everything!!! It cleans corners and under furniture better than my $400 vacuum!!! It cleans up broken glass -picks it right up. My grandchildren clean up after their playtime ...it picks up crayons and any sort of child crumbs. If you read a review from someone that compares it to a monster vacuum they don't know what there're tallking about...it's made great for the price and my house at Christmas was so neat and tidy with no bits and pieces of anything laying about!!! I highly reccomend the Swivel Sweeper a great little gizmo!!! I love it!!!  Paula Amityville NY"
Home,5.0,Happy with my Swivel Sweeper,"This is one of those products that you might be skeptical to buy, but I can tell you that it is worth it!!  I have all wood floors and the Swivel Sweeper is the handiest little product that I have ever used.  Light weight and amazingly powerful for its size.  It's not meant to be used like a vaccuum, but it picks up all those little messes that are annoying....especially in the corners of the kitchen!!  I love it!"
Home,1.0,JUNK,"After 3 months of use, the battery quit charging and the pole broke. In the trash it goes!"
Home,4.0,Excellent for in-between-cleans,"I have four children who are messy eaters and messy crafters.  We rent and this house has carpet in every room, including the dining room and kitchen.  Until I got my Swivel Sweeper, I had to lug my vacuum out every day, sometimes multiple times each day.  Otherwise, food and craft items would get ground into the carpet and I'd have to shampoo it frequently.  It was a real pain.    My mom gave me the Swivel Sweeper nearly two months ago after she got the buy-one-get-one deal from the infomercial.  I have to tell you that I am in love with this thing.  When she first gave it to me I thanked her but truly expected it to be a piece of junk that wouldn't pick anything up.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Cereal, raisins, bits of construction paper, wiggly eyes; it picks it all up beautifully and no longer do I have to lug out my vacuum every day.      It's for quick clean-ups and I have not had any problem with the battery running out quickly.  I usually get multiple trips through the dining room and kitchen before having to charge the battery.  The catch tray pops out for easy dumping and easy checking for things you don't want to throw away (like the wiggle eyes and my daughter's tiny Pony World pieces).  I like that it comes with a tool to rip hair and string off the rollbars with.  Every vacuum should come with such a tool.  It's really just a seam ripper; you can get one at any sewing store, but it is convenient that it actually comes with one and, quite frankly, I hadn't thought about using one for this purpose previously.    I find the Swivel Sweeper to be sturdy and reliable.  My kids love to use it when they clean their rooms, as well, and they aren't exactly kind to it.  They bump it into beds and walls and it's still working fine and still unbroken.  I would certainly recommend this to any parent."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,[[A  SIN:B0007MWZEK AS SEEN ON TV Cordless Swivel Sweeper]]  I highly recommend this product to everyone
Home,4.0,convenient!,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I just love it!  I use a Roomba to vacuum most of the house in between major cleanings, but I had nothing for the steps!  Now I do, and I couldn't be happier.  Great little sweeper!"
Home,5.0,Hardwood Magic!,We have an area of hardwood that leads into linoleum.  It works beautifully sliding under barstools where the kids eat and drop crumbs. It also picks up our hamsters shavings.  One never has to bend over.  I suggest not using it on carpet where hair tends to gather - get a Dyson for that!  My three year old thinks it is a present for her and loves to clean - theres no way she can get it wrong.
Home,4.0,Good purchase,"We've had our swivel sweeper for close to a year now so I feel ready to give an informed review on it. Our apartment is basically all hardwood floors and it was a pain to get out the vacuum, find places to plug it in and do the whole place with the suction tube--so we saw the swivel sweeper on TV and it looked like just what we needed. We found it cheap at the drug store and bought it there.    Overall, we're very happy with the purchase. Nothing has broken on it and we use it almost every other day. It's very light and quick to use whenever you see dirt or dust on the floor. On the hard floors, it works very well--even on the grout on the tiles for the most part. On the rugs however, it's not so good. Clearly the speed/power drops significantly when it's on anything other than a hard surface. It barely gets the job done and really kills the battery. We still use our vacuum on the rugs. And on the topic of the battery, we charge it overnight once every week and a half or so. We can vacuum our whole apartment (hardwood floors) 3-4 times on a charge (800 sq. ft.).     It's really easy to get under furniture and around table/bed legs with its swivel action, like it shows on TV. It does get in corners pretty well too, and picks things up in any direction. In the TV ad it says that it's quiet.. It's definitely NOT quiet. They clearly block out a lot of its noise in the ad and to use it around a sleeping baby is a joke. If that's your big selling point, don't buy it.    I highly recommend this product for people with lots of hard floors, who just want to keep the floor tidy all the time with a quick and simple sweeper. It's not going to do deep cleaning, but it's much easier than a broom or vacuum for all those in-between dirt and messes on the floor."
Home,4.0,good sweeper,"Sweeper works pretty well.  Sometimes I have to sweep from left to right instead of forward and backward to pick something up, but it usually gets it.  I'm amazed at all the dust bunnies it gets!  Got one for myself and one for my sister.  She loves hers!  Do read and follow the instructions.  Do not leave your battery in the charger for more than 24 hrs. (I think that's why so many people have written about failed batteries.)"
Home,5.0,Better than I expected,"OK! I never write reviews even though I have never been disappointed about any item I have ordered from Amazon. The swivel sweeper is great (and I have bought a bunch of cleaning items that don't work and I still wish I had a magic wand that would just sweep all this mess away.)    I am in my late 60's, have 2 cats and with 2 hip and 2 back surgeries, I can't bend over to sweep so this item is great for picking up loose litter, paper scraps from my shredder, etc., etc. I love it!"
Home,5.0,Works great ... could be even better,"I've had the Swivel Sweeper for about 3 months. I have had no problems with it or the batteries. I find it to be very convenient to use. I have read extensively about the problems that others have had so I was wary about getting one.     I bought my sister one for Christmas and she loves it.    It's great on wood floors and ceramic tile. I don't think it would be as effective on rugs - since it is just a sweeper - not a vacuum, and the load on the motor due to the drag on the carpet would likely discharge the battery pack very quickly.    In regard to the battery issues, the Company appears to have a quality control problem since they probably use the cheapest NiMH batteries available to maximize their margins. So, it could be hit or miss - you get a good set of batteries in the pack or you don't. There are six C batteries in the battery pack (which can't be opened) - if they are not matched properly, the pack won't last because the higher voltage batteries will discharge into the lower voltage batteries.    Also, the battery charger is not microprocessor controlled which gives the capability to monitor the battery temperature and voltage and thus control the rate of charge to minimize battery temperature. The charger only charges at a constant rate instead of switching to a trickle charge when the charge nears completion to reduce the battery temperature which preserves battery life. Heat is worst enemy for batteries. This is why you shouldn't keep the battery pack in the charger for more than 5 or 6 hours (less time if the battery wasn't completely discharged).    Also, remove the battery pack physically from the charger when not charging - otherwise the charger will discharge the battery.    It would have been nice if the Company gave the provision to replace the C batteries in the battery pack. In that way, a higher quality battery could be purchased from other sources.    It would have also been nice if the Company provided an option to purchase one of those microprocessor controlled fast chargers that charge the battery in two hours and then go into trickle charge to keep the battery topped off - then one wouldn't have to worry about overcharging. You can purchase these chargers for about $10.    When my battery pack fails, I will likely cut open the pack (which is not easy to do) and replace the batteries with high quality C NiMH which you can find readily in Radio Shack or on the Web (e.g., greenbatteries.com).  And, maybe even adapt the battery charger to a microprocessor based fast charger.    All in all, the product is a good idea and works fairly well for the price. But, I feel that there should be other options that allow the customer to buy up so to speak.    Note, you are better off buying the Swivel Sweeper from the many dealers on ebay - it's cheaper ($25) - that's what I did."
Home,1.0,Pure Junk,"When we first bought this we thought we would have a good alternative to our dust buster. Well it has to be the cheapest piece of garbage I ever bought. The plastic is paper then it kept starting and stopping like it had a short and when you pick it up shut it off first or it will tilt and throw whatever it picked up back out again. We have owned it for 6 weeks and now the battery only lasts about 5 minutes after a charge. I should have known better than buying an informercial product but I got burned, I'm writing this so others don't. If you want to throw your money away buy it, otherwise look for something else, our's is only days away from being trashed."
Home,5.0,Carl,[[ASIN:B0007MWZEK AS SEEN ON TV Cordless Swivel Sweeper]]  It works just as advertised and better than I expected.
Home,1.0,Swivelling and walking away from this sweeper.,"This was a x-mas present from my wife's grandmother, I did not spend money from my pocket for the Swivel Sweeper -- thank the gods.    Used this product for about three months and _loved_ it. I have hardwood floors and the regular vacuum I brought along from my old, carpeted apartment has wheels that do my floor no good and also doesn't really work well on the floor. So the Swivel Sweeper was great, until it stopped working. I cleaned all the dirt, hair and dust from the brushes, which was a task in itself as they cannot be removed for cleaning, and it still wouldn't work.    I know all about rechargeable batteries and have been making sure to let it go for _no more_ than 10 hours, going out of my way to make it 6-8. 2 more than the required about isn't much of a margin for a product I've been using infrequently. I spent 25-30 minutes on hold waiting for a customer service representative who spoke down to me and had the most incredulous, apathetic and unconcerned attitude I've encountered from any help line. Unless you're a stay at home person who makes a point of keeping timers next to their chargers, avoid this product.    It would have been songs and fireworks had it not been for its lack of endurance, Ontel Products Corporation's bloody awful customer service and the cheaply made components. Unfortunately, the Swivel Sweeper is the spawn of infomercial mediocrity, and people are paying to find that out."
Home,1.0,Horrible,"I bought this item and I was happy with it for about three days.  After dumping the tray and cleaning out the brissles, everytime it touched the floor (put weight down) it wouldn't work. If you lifted it up a little it would, but what good is that.  I made sure not to over charge the battery and paid extra close attention to instructions.  I recently bought it and will have to go through the return procedures...not looking forward to it. It definately does not stand up to the hype that the commercial portrays...    Kristina"
Home,1.0,Lasted for one week!!!!!  Horrible product!!,"I see many have already stated the obvious.  This thing is trash.  It worked for 20 good minutes the first time I used it.  After that, the battery wouldnt last 10 minutes if even that.  Now, it wont even last 3 minutes.  I hear they charge you to replace the battery too.  Forget it!!  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!"
Home,4.0,After One Year,"After owning and using the Swivel Sweeper for just over 12 months, it is still running, albeit a bit noiser,  and the battery life with proper charging is still good. Early on, I did have problems with the tabs to release the cover, but a little careful use of sandpaper cured this problem, immediately.    Please, do NOT expect this to be a vacuum. It does a reputable job of  sweeping up most things, even sloppy dropped food around the table. As it has aged, it is however, more challenged with fine hair or lint, and likes to spit it out, likely due to wear. I should note, I have no pets, but use this sweeper at least TWICE per day.    I have not had occasion to contact the company, so I cannot speak to negative feedback on that topic. Compared to the Shark and its competitors, and the Bissell Cordless, I believe that despite its kind of cheap construction, it is a better product at actually sweeping than those units, and in many areas, can be purchased cheaper.    Battery maintenance is critical, and it is imperative that it be run down to a virtual stop, before recharging.  Again, no problems here, either, with a solid 6 hour recharge.    I paid $35.00 at Target for mine, and provided your expectations are moderate, this thing is pretty amazing for what it is. I suggest trying one out from a place like Target, saving your box and receipt. Stores like them  have a no questions asked return policy. Not much to lose to try it, other than a little time, and GASOLINE.  GASOLINE PRICES are another subject."
Home,5.0,Wonderful,This product does all that it claims.  I LOVE it.  I did my whole house the day I got it.
Home,5.0,Great for hardwood floors,"My sister told me about the Swivel Sweeper, she said it was the best, so I thought I'd try it.  I have a small house, 800 square feet, that is all hardwood flooring.  The two of us own four cats and a dog, and I am forever sweeping.  The Swivel Sweeper is very easy, quick, not nearly as loud as a vacuum cleaner, light, and lays flat so it can get under beds.  The tray that holds all the debris is small, and I have to empty it once half way through the cleaning, but I don't consider that an inconvenience.  I also use it to sweep the furniture.    How well it works on carpet, I don't know.  I imagine it would work ok on low pile types, but I believe it is meant for flooring, and it works great.  I highly recommend this Sweeper."
Home,1.0,Don't bother with this product,"I had one of these for about three months.  It worked ok initially as long as I was careful not to let all the detritus fall out of the container.  That happened a couple times -- very annoying.    The real lame part of this product is the battery, which is absolutely terrible.  There are very stringent charging requirements and even if you follow those to the letter, the battery still wears out.  I think I used mine all of a dozen times.  The whole unit went in the trash today when I discovered the battery to be dead beyond repair and that the replacements are $10.  No thanks.  I'll stick with my Dyson, even if it is bigger and heavier...  Hey, at least it works."
Home,4.0,Cool tool!,"The Swivel Sweeper is a great product, but you have to take care of it.  This is my second purchase in less than a year.  It was my mistake that caused the first one to go bad, though.  I overcharged the battery, because I just forgot to unplug the charger, or take the battery out.  I was going to buy just a new battery, but they are almost as much as a whole new unit, so I opted for the whole unit.  It's OK though, because now I have the old one for spare parts.  It works great. It goes under beds, and the coffee table, and around corners...really does everything it says on TV."
Home,5.0,Art of Paper Quilling,This book is great.  I have several quilling books and love it when I get one that actually teaches something different.  It has several different projects with full instructions.  This is definitely a book that every quiller should have.

Home,2.0,Get ready to by a new battery!,"We have owned the swivel sweeper for 8 months. It worked pretty well for a  while.   Now, the battery will not hold a charge very long and it only works for about 7 minutes.  Realizing that we need a new batrery, I checked into it. It is 14.95 and 7.00 for shipping.  7.00 for shipping a small battery? This company is really charging 18.00 for the battery because they could ship it for less.  They are just adding shipping as a way to generate more income for them. It does not cost 7.00 to ship a battery that weighs less than a pound.  They think the public is stupid. Typical of TV stuff and we shouldnt have expected more.  I will buy a different brand rather than give this company anymore of my money.     Why would I pay 21.00 for a new battery when I can buy a new swivel sweeper for 10 bucks more.  But hello....I am not buying a new one.  This product could prove expensive to operate over a period of time."
Home,1.0,If I could give it a zero star.....!!!,"It was given to me as a gift. I guess I should be happy after looking at some of the other reviews. Mine actually lasted 6 months! that's a lot longer than some others! and I religiously followed the instructions for maintenance, battery charging, etc. After emailing the company, I can't tell you how many times, I just gave up. Now it sits in my closet. What a waste of money!!!"
Home,1.0,junk,"i got this sweeper and paid 34.99 for it. got it home and charged the battery and started to use it and it flipped over all the time.it wasn't as easy as it looks on tv.even tring to move it from floor to carpet it flipped and the dirt tray scattered all over the place.i wouldn't buy another one for nothing and i learned my listen on this kind of sweeper,it is more work than help.after sweeping up all the dirt and dust many times,putting this in my give away box at my garage sale.it must took the people who advertise this sweeper alot of practice to make it look easy on tv."
Home,5.0,Mama's little helper...,"I was searching for a quick picker-up between my weekly vacuuming - especially in the kitchen (I'm a messy cook...)  My swiffer sweeper was great pushing around the dirt, but not so good at picking it up.  Let me introduce you to my little friend...<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper works great on tile and carpet. It takes me about 10 minutes to go through my house, and it always leaves it looks clean and inviting.  It's certainly much easier than lugging out my Dyson and more effective at getting into those hard to reach places.  There's no bags to buy and cleaning out the unit is a breeze.  However, you do need to clean out the brushes every couple of uses.  The battery keeps its charge for 3-4 uses.<br /><br />This is not meant to be your primary vacuum unless you're in s small apartment with wood floors...  Which my daughter lives in, and she absolutely loves her Swivel Sweeper.  Plus, it takes up next to no room in the closet.<br /><br />I have strongly recommended this sweeper to my friends, family and co-workers.  Anything to make life a little easier!!!"
Home,4.0,My 6 year old can help with daily chores!,"I love this product!     The swivel sweeper is basically a broom and dustpan put together in one nice package. It works wonderfully on my laminate floors and it also works on the area rugs that we have. I would not recommend that it replace your vacuum, as it does not have any actual suction power. But it is a great product, much better than the Swiffer models, this one does not need to be plugged in to charge and it holds a charge for a much longer time, I can clean the entire house (all laminate flooring throughout) with one charge (plus, it will pick up some things on your area rugs whereas the Swiffer model does not).    As a mother of 3 boys I can attest that it is super easy to use and durable.  My 6 year old loves helping me with the chores and it lasted for a year before my 2 year old ripped the wire out of the battery pack (something that only my child would be able to do).     I have other neighbors and friends that have had their swivel sweeper for 2-3 years with the only problem of needing to replace the battery as they left it charging for more than the manufacture recommended 24 hours.    I am going to buy another one as I can sweep the floor and hold my 4 month old baby at the same time.     A great little gadget, I highly recommend it!"
Home,2.0,poor design.  cheap,"This was given to me as a gift by my \\""as seen on TV\\"" addicted mother.  The idea sounded great as I have 2 young kids, 2 large dogs and a cat. My house, with the exception of my bedroom, is all hardwood or marble and I hate dragging out the vacuume every day- so I don't.  Sweeping just seems to be a waste of time stirring up fur and dust.  I need something like this for daily dirt removal. If this was made well, it would be perfect.  As stated, it is not a vacuume, but a sweeper and is supposed to perform as such.  The problem I have is, like everyone else, my battery function is poor.  My mom bought me a new battery, so I have 2 poor performing batteries.  I am sure I must have left them charging longer than instructed, but who has time to figure out how much charge they need and remove them promptly from the charger when they are fully charged?  The batteries function slowly, pulsate, or just turn off after a few minutes.  The second problem I have is the hair cleanup.  Strings, hair and easter grass :) need to be removed every cleaning or so.  Not an easy process with the stitch remover they give you as a cleanup tool.  It takes so long, it negates the benefits of using the stupid thing.  The design is aweful, cheap and so not worth the price... but I still use the stupid thing daily as I have no better option.  Please let me know if anyone knows of a similar product that functions.  I would be willing to pay for quality.  I am using this thing partially to get my mom's money's worth!"
Home,5.0,Great product,Got my product in only a few day. It works great just as advertised. I have no complaints. Great for anyone with back problems. So easy to use. It glides over the floor. Better on hard floors than carpet. Good for spot cleaning carpet.
Home,3.0,"Great at first, poor in the long run","I received the Swivel Sweeper for Christmas 2006 and was very pleased with it in the beginning. It swept well and the swivel head almost made cleaning fun. BUT, in less than a year the rechargable battery would no longer take a full charge and I had to spend another $25 for a new battery. Even with the new battery, the sweeper's performance really declined to the point that I'm now shopping for a replacement vac. While I loved the Swivel Sweeper for the first 10 months, I will not be buying a new one to replace my old one."
Home,5.0,"Works as advertised, which is very well!","The Virtual Wall Lighthouse is amazing, turning on and off with the Roomba 500 series via RF. I use a network of 5 of these to keep my Roomba out of the bathroom and to let it know which rooms are which.    Definitely get these over the plain old manually-activated virtual walls. You'll forget to turn them off and they eat batteries. Also, the lighthouse works with rechargeable batteries and the manual ones don't."
Home,4.0,awesome!  it works well!,"I may be blessed, but my sweeper is awesome.  we live in the country and I homeschool and have three children under the age of 6.  we also own goats, dog, chickens, cats.  we get lots of dust.  i also have at least 1000sq foot of tile alone, and another of hard wood floors that collect lots and lots of dust daily.  i would normally sweep twice daily, i hate to see dirt, dust, hay you name it on the ground and this would take a loooonnnnnggggg time.  this sweeper was a gift from my mom who just came and spent two weeks visiting and helped daily clean the floors.  she said i needed this sweeper thing.  i was very unsure of this product. but she purchased it for me.  i got it put it together in charged the battery. it works so well.  it takes me about 5 minutes to zip through the floors, verses 20 min.  to a busy homeschool mom this is amazing.    sorry so many of you are having problems.  mine works great!  God bless you all and remember Jesus is coming soon! Jessica"
Home,5.0,Quilling is so creative,"I did Quilling in the '70s and want to renew my skill and imagination. There are so many new innovative designs in '08, I'll have gifts for everyone. Peggy Ft Lauderdale"
Home,1.0,useless,I bought this and returned it two days later.  Battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than 5-10 minutes (package says will run for 45 minutes).  I wanted it for mostly picking up pet hair - what it did bother to pick up ended up all over the unit instead of in the collection cup.  Took it back and got a refund...
Home,4.0,swivel sweeper drama,"i am very happy with this product. i got it for my mom for her birthday, two weeks ago. she has been useing it everyday, sometimes a couple times. i give it four stars, for its light and easy to use, even if you have trouble with heavy objects."
Home,4.0,This is great product,I've had this product for 5.5 months now.  I use it everynight to clean the kitty litter and shed fur in a bathroom with linoleum.  I love the way it maneuvers so easily around things.      We have had to clean the brushes with the supplied tool once due to cat hair wrapping around it.    The only improvement would be to some how make the dust/dirt tray bigger.
Home,5.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"The sweeper is great!  It is lightweight and picks up well. It, of course, doesn't have the suction of a vacuum cleaner, but for daily light duty cleaning, it is wonderful.  I have dogs and on a daily basis I can use this instead of hauling out my heavy vacuum cleaner.  It is also good in the kitchen, after the dogs have eaten and dinner has been prepared to pick up whatever lands on the floor.  It has a battery pack you keep plugged in, and it stores away easily without taking up much room."
Home,5.0,Perfect!,"Looks great, very subtle, but have gotten a ton of compliments. Great product, great look!"
Home,4.0,"works well, needs wall socket","Works well, contains and guides roomba effectively. Nice to have option of Lighthouse and virtual wall together.    But wish I could give it power off a wall socket, not just batteries. Then I could forget about it completely!"
Home,3.0,Beautiful designs but ...,"This book has absolutely beautiful designs of paper quilling.  There are many styles of flower that are completely different than I have ever seen.  However, as an experienced quiller I do not think this book will be very helpful for beginning quillers.  The author uses strips of a length which are not, to my knowledge, available in either Canada or the United States (10 5/8\\"").  In addition, some of the lengths she says to use for certain designs seem very suspect.  In some cases short lengths are used (according to her instructions) but the picture shows an item clearly made from a much longer strip.  In addition she mentions widths of paper which I have never seen here (3/16\\"", 9/32\\"", and 5/16\\"").  Finally, her names of the colours of the strips in her book are names which I have never seen here.  If I was trying to follow her instructions and was looking in the stores for \\""dusty grape\\"" strips that were 10 5/8\\"" long, I think I would be very frustrated when I couldn't find them.  Therefore, overall I am somewhat disappointed in this book, even though I do love the designs."
Home,3.0,Swivel Sweeper OK,"It was a little louder than we thought it would be.  It does a pretty good job of sweeping, not as good as a powerful vacuum cleaner.  We are pleased with it, though.  The kids don't mind sweeping the floors when asked, because the Swivel Sweeper is fun to use."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,"I got it for my wife,and she loves not having to drag out the bulky vacuum cleaner especially on hard surface floors."
Home,5.0,Pretty great little workhorse,"I am on my second Swivel Sweeper, not cuz my first one broke but because my son left it behind when we moved- I couldn't wait to get another one. This sweeper has worked superbly for me in a large apartment with 4 cats, teen boys, carpet, wood and tile floors. It is very maneuverable, surprising strong for its light weight and size, and my two have been very durable- I am very surprised at reviewers who have had problems with this, I highly recommend it- I actually use it as my primary vacuum and it is very user-friendly since I walk with a cane and have rotator cuff problems, this little gem makes things a lot easier for me."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper,"The sweeper is great for fast cleanups on carpeting, as in rug under dining table.  New batteries cost something like $12 or so, the only drawback.  I have two, which I keep for those special places where it would be troublesome to use broom or vacuum -- oft-traveled paths, around kitchen counters, etc.  Stores in practically no space at all; I keep them in pantry and bedroom closet against wall, sweeper compacts itself against handle."
Home,5.0,great little sweeper,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it. I own one as well and it is great on hard wood and carpeting too. Worth the money!
Home,4.0,Does the job needed,"I've had my sweeper for about a year and a half.  I was never PERFECTLY happy with it- but it did what I needed. It does a pretty good job for daily pick-ups in my kitchen/dining area.  It works well on the hardwoods, and we have a large braided rug (dark) and it picks up all of the dirt. It's very easy to operate (It's my 4-yr olds favorite chore.). It's even easy enough that my kids empty it out.  It's very lightweight.    I am now having to get a replacement battery as it just can't get charged enough- but for doing almost daily pickups, and having lasted this long. I'm very satisfied.      My only complaint is it doesn't do very well on other carpet. The rugs in my kitchen have almost not pile to them, but any regular carpet (like stairs) or my other bathroom rugs, it just bogs it down and the brushes can't turn.  SO it's best on hardwood/tile/very flat rugs.    I would definitely buy another one (and planning on it for my bathrooms)."
Home,1.0,Pure joy for  4 weeks!,"Well, most of the positive reviews here are based on short usage, I think. Make no mistake this thing is as delicate as a flower. Within a month the stick broke in the middle. I returned and got a replacement from Bed Bath&Beyond. After 2 months the battery won't charge anymore. Too bad the warranty is good for only 90 days. Now you know why.   Pros.  -Worked OK when it worked.  Cons.  -Very delicate  -Battery dies in  approx 3 months.  -Forget about customer service"
Home,5.0,Wonderful Work in a Great Book,I am fairly new to the art of paper quilling and was not really very interested until I received this book.  Ms. Choi did a wonderful job in the explanation of techniques and methods in which to create wonderful projects with paper. This book has full color photos and complete illustrated sketches as well as instructions on how to create great projects.  I am very interested in making the square gift box on page 102 and was surprised to see that the author has given detailed instructions on how to create the box that the quilling will be placed on. (In most cases I am told to go to my nearest store to purchase a ready made box!)  She even has given embellishment tips.  Great job on a great book.  I will definately recommend this book to anyone out there who is interested in paper quilling.
Home,1.0,Horrible!!,"I had high expectations of this product, my floors are all hardwood and I hate to see dust in it. I use this every single day and after 2 weeks eventhough I was using the tools to clean it, it started to have everything around the bristles ( specially hair) and stop working soon after that. It's almost imposible to remove the things that get attached to the bristles!!! I would never buy this again!!!"
Home,3.0,"works well, seems to have a short","I just bought my sweeper yesterday.  It seems to sweep very well however I think mine may have a short in it or is having a hard time with the battery connector.  It seems to exist where sections C & D on the handle connect.  While I am using it, I have to occasionally twist the handle slightly to keep the metal connecters touching.  Does anyone else have this problem?  Maybe it is just because it is new.  I will keep it for a week and if the problem continues, I will exchange it for another one.  For the $30 I paid for it (W/20% off coupon at BB&B) it seems to do the job!"
Home,5.0,Don't buy this!,"This was my original review when I had the Swivel Sweeper for about a week: \\""I love the Swivel Sweeper!  I have a 4000 square foot house and I can't keep up the cleaning with vaccuum cleaners.  It's too overwhelming to lug around a vaccuum and plug in the unit in every room.  I have developed a weekly regimen where I use a swiffer for the floors and the Swivel Sweeper for the rugs - very easy!!!!!  I use the vacuums for company and deep cleaning, but the Swivel is great for that in-between cleaning!\\""    Now, just a couple of weeks later, the charge only lasts for about a minute and that's only for bare floors.  It can't handle anything.  It's the same issue detailed in other reviews.    DON'T CHANCE IT!  Buy a Dirt Devil cordless vac for only about $59 which we did today."
Home,5.0,I love it !!!!!!,"I love it!......so lightweight and convenient. No more brooms, dustpans, etc. So quick and easy to use. Of course it's not a regular vacuum cleaner so, if you're purchasing this for your regular heavy duty cleaning, don't bother. I'm considering purchasing another for my lower level so that I always have one handy."
Home,1.0,Swivel Sweeper... Better than a broom and dust pan!,"I think the swivel sweeper is better than a dust pan and broom. Cleans the floors a little better than a broom, but also you don't have to bend to sweep up a pile, and it works faster than a broom. Of course it is not perfect, like the fact that it doesn't get everything perfectly, and things get tangled in the brushes. Also it is not that great for carpets so I prefer my vacum on carpets, but if you have mostly hard wood or tile it is perfect. Overall I love this product, and it makes my cleaning easier.    *UPDATE* After having this for three months the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore. After this happened to me I did research and found this happened to many others. I also asked my sister and mother-in-law who also bought it, and they too had the problem with the battery. My sister even bought a replacement and it happened again. Do not buy this!"
Home,5.0,Sweeper,"This product is great for tile floors.  I still use by big sweeper, but I love this for every day clean up.  It's great to take along if you need to.  We are quilters and go to the fire station to sew and this is great to take along for clean up.  Shipping was a little slow from this company and it wasn't packaged very well, but it arrived safely."
Home,5.0,"Wonderful, Artistic, and Instructional","I own several paper quilling books and this is one of my favorites. I highly reccomend it. Claire shows off beautiful work, ranging from the simple to the complex. I also enjoyed her gallery in the back a great deal. The only thing is that nearly all the pieces are floral themed, which I found to be perfectly fine."
Home,4.0,I like it!,"I really like this product, though I don't use it.  I've had it for about a year and a half and it works just fine.  My 3 boys (6,10,11) sweep the kitchen/dining floors with it every night after dinner.  It works much better than the broom and dustpan.  At first I wouldn't let the youngest use it, but he begged and when I finally let him, he actually does a better job with it than the older two.  The boys think it's cool.  It's quick and they don't mind helping out.  We haven't had any problems with it.  I like it!"
Home,4.0,works well,"While this is not a sweeper intended for carpet, it will pick up small messes.  It is very handy for tile and hardwood.  The charge last for a long time and the only complaint I have is that the dirt catcher (where the dirt is held) is too small.  I love the way it swivels!"
Home,5.0,"Easy to install, looks great!",My husband installed this quickly without any additional materials. It's sturdy and looks clean and contemporary.
Home,5.0,It is actually as good as it is advertised.,My sister and I ordered the swivel sweeper together.  We had seen a ad for it on TV and thought we could give it a try.  Well it works great on all of our floors.  I especially like the fact that I don't have to get my vacuum out every time that I need to clean the carpet or floor.  I would recommend this to anyone especially since it is also very light.
Home,5.0,Awesome,"This thing is awesome.  It does not replace a vacuum and it does not do a lot for cleaning carpet BUT, for hard floor surfaces this is the easiest, fastest, neatest, funnest, etc. thing to clean with.  It does a very good job and a very fast job of doing what a broom and dustpan would do."
Home,4.0,What did I do without it?,"I have had my swivel sweeper for about 6 months.  It has not broken, and the battery still charges.  It is indispensable for cleaning round the cats' litter box.  Cleaning carpet strains the battery, but it does pick up every grain and crumb.  In the kitchen, after clean-up from the evening meal, I just run the swivel cleaner over the tiles, and all the crumbs, and dropped food is picked up.  The four brushes and swivel head give amazing versatility, and it is easy to get into corners and narrow places.  For the kitchen and bathrooms, it beats my Roomba in noise and speed and with very little effort from me.  In fact, I plan to buy a second one, so that I have one both upstairs and downstairs.  It is a little clumsy to empty, but it works!"
Home,5.0,"It's flimsy, but works great!","I absolutely love this thing. It is flimsy, yes, but if you're gentle with it, no big deal. It works great, picks up everything, even wet food thrown to the floor by the baby, dog hair on the carpet and gets into corners amazingly!  I like that it's so lightweight. It's exactly what I wanted; something light and convenient to clean the wood floors so I didn't have to drag out my heavy vacuum. I have had no mechanical troubles with mine whatsoever."
Home,1.0,the worst!,"I bought this item with high hopes.  My daughter and I both have long hair, which of course leads to having to vacuum constantly.  On top of that, we have a small home with a lot of traffic and a cat who sheds.  Plus the cat litter that goes along with her, not to mention all of the everyday things that accumulate.  This item worked maybe the first time I got it.  I had to cut the hair out of the rollers several times during each use.  I must have overworked the thing because within a few days it just sort of died.  This was one of the worst sweepers/vacuums I have ever tried.  I tried it on both my carpeted areas and vinyl kitchen floor.  It didn't work very well on either.  And I won't go on about the stairs ..."
Home,5.0,sweeper,"I love my Swivel Sweeper that I bought through you.  I couldn't live without it.  I would like to add that your transaction was very quick and efficient.  In the beginning I had ordered one directly from the Swivel Sweeper company.  I had a terrible time with them.  When I checked on my purchase their representative said they had no record of my purchase, and a second technician told me the same thing, although I had a confirmation email.  She told me to just delete the purchase from my computer, and I did.  Then I ordered through you.  Guess what!  Eventually I received (two sweepers from the Swivel Sweeper company).  I now have three.  It was great doing business with you after this awful experience.  Mary Jo Sisson March  [...]"
Home,5.0,Impressed,I had debated a long time if I should purchase another quilling book but kept coming back to this one and looking at it.  I am so glad I decided to buy the book. I feel it is excellent and directions and pictures are very clear.  I would highly recommend it to anyone whether they have been quilling for a long time or just starting out.
Home,5.0,very nice,"This is a very nice, modern, wine rack.  Well made and easy to mount on the wall.  I took the advise of another review I came across and put up beefier drywall anchors.  Definitely recommend this product.  I came across another picture where 2 or 3 were put up along a large wall in a dining room - looked awesome.  Oh, and I have also received lots of compliments."
Home,5.0,Great Product,I received this as a wedding gift and I think this is a great product for in between vacuuming times if needed to quickly sweep. It works great under couches and dressers. It also is a great tool for the bathrrom and the kitchen. It will pick up anything from twistie ties to dust to crumbs and dirton hard floors and carpet. Mine has not lost its charge or broken in any way. It is quiet and rechargeable and easy to store. It has replaced my broom and dust pan. I love this product.
Home,1.0,Horrid,"Worst product of its type I have ever used.  It's impossible to clean, has a short battery life, and cleans poorly.  On bare floors the rotating brushes kick away as much debris as the weak vacuum picks up.  Don't even bother with carpets.  The thing that irks me the most, though--it makes me a moron for getting sucked in by another outrageous infomercial with its absurd claims."
Home,5.0,"A Deck With Sumptuous Textures, Masterful Artistry and Utter Originality","&#34;While the physical deck has taken over three years to complete, from an inspirational standpoint, Deviant Moon Tarot has been at least thirty years in the making. It is not only a testament to my art, but a record of my life.&#34; - Patrick Valenza, from the LWB (Little White Book)<br /><br />I've seen hundreds of Tarot decks over the years, and I can honestly say there is nothing on the market that rivals the sumptuous textures, masterful artistry and utter originality of the Deviant Moon Tarot.<br /><br />For months now, several images of the Deviant Moon Tarot were posted to the web, capturing the imagination of Tarot enthusiasts worldwide. Many were clamoring for news, more card images and a definitive release date with an almost desperate excitement.<br /><br />Tarot fans, rejoice! U.S. Games has now unleashed the highly anticipated Deviant Moon Tarot upon the world! And let me tell you, if the exquisite, highly-detailed online images whetted your appetite, the actual deck goes above and beyond expectation! (After my deck arrived in the mail, I was almost shaking trying to unwrap the cellophane.)<br /><br />As Patrick revealed in my interview with him a few months ago, he created each image made by manipulating digital photographs taken of 18th century tombstones. He noted:<br /><br />&#34;I would explore cemeteries and abandoned buildings, taking many photos of textures or objects of interest to blend into my drawings. Rotted doors and windows became buildings and structures, while tombstones parts were fabricated into clothes, accessories, or even the citizens themselves. I like to think the photos contain some of the `spirit' found in the places I have visited, and that perhaps some of their energy will reflect in the cards I have made.&#34;<br /><br />As you can tell, the Deviant Moon Tarot blows me away. One of the reasons is Patrick's ornate and captivating rendering of the Aces. In most Tarot decks, the Aces are relegated to a singular suit symbol with minimal artistry; however, in the Deviant Moon Tarot, the Aces are lavishly illustrated.<br /><br />Replete with arresting beings with unusual bodies, moonlike faces combine with anatomy reptilian, humanoid, mechanic and alien. The King of Pentacles wears a crown of smoking black industrial chimneys while the King of Wands shepherds playful children with tree-like heads.<br /><br />In the amusing Five of Cups, a nagging wife reams out her husband for presumably spilling three of the cups while her hen-pecked husband holds his ears against her shrillness. In the Five of Pentacles card, a milky three-fingered and toed creature with pendulous, pointed silver-tipped breasts creeps around a building housing a giant peering eye. (According to the LWB, she is a woman of ill repute).<br /><br />The Deviant Moon expands on Rider-Waite imagery with a gloriously twisted perspective, reflecting common associations in dazzling patterns, striking colors, and surprising juxtapositions (e.g. a tree that bleeds red, a Page that has created himself out of spare parts and a sharp-dressed masked armless woman with a wheel for a left &#34;foot&#34;). The 9 of Cups, usually deemed the &#34;Wish Card&#34;, aptly depicts a genie who's just emerged from a child's magic lamp.<br /><br />Surprisingly illuminating, the 41-page LWB provides upright and reversed meanings as well as a brief commentary on each card (which is especially helpful for some of the puzzling depictions). Some of the meanings I hadn't heard before, such as the 5 of Wands indicating &#34;conflict with neighbors&#34;, the 8 of Swords can pointing towards censorship and the 5 of Cups revealing marital strife.<br /><br />The slick, glossy cards measure approximately 5 ¼ x 2 ¾ inches with a rather muted moon motif in earth tones comprising the reversible backings. This Premier Edition of the Deviant Moon Tarot also comes with a custom 17 x 20 inch spread sheet with Patrick's comprehensive 10-card Lunatic Spread.<br /><br/>I knew I'd love the deck when I got it, but I had reservations if such a bizarre yet stunning offering would &#34;read&#34; well. I'm pleased to report that not only is the Deviant Moon Tarot a solid reading deck, but also unexpectedly insightful. Even when I first began looking at the cards, phrases would pop into my head describing possible meanings for what I saw.<br /><br />So despite the unusual characters populating the world of the Deviant Moon, they still speak messages relevant and purposeful to discerning individuals. This would make a great journaling deck, too, as well as one for comparative Tarot studies.<br /><br />Art deck aficionados will want to have the Deviant Moon Tarot for their collection as well as those in the market for a decidedly offbeat deck. As reluctant as I am to say it, I don't think this deck will appeal to *everyone* nor would it necessarily be a good first deck for those wanting to devote themselves to studying the Tarot. However, the Deviant Moon Tarot contains amazing gifts for the beholder and the LWB is better than most for explaining card meanings.<br /><br />Patrick Valenza's illustrations are so magnificently dramatic and unique that I hope U.S. Games comes out with a coffee book version of this deck, as well as an array of related giftware and art prints. I know that I'd definitely be in line for all things Deviant Moon!<br /><br />(To see 16 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Bookd&#34; well.

Home,5.0,The BEST sweeper we've used - commercial use,"After many different products that cost a lot more, we bought the swivel sweeper for our home with laminate floors. We love it! All of our friends now have one and they love it as well. I run a retreat center and we serve multiple meals to other 15,000 people a year. After breakfast and lunch we use two swivel sweepers to quickly pickup everything on both tile and carpet. We use a regular vacuum after the last meal of the day. Yes, the batteries run dry after about 6 months, but they are very cheap to replace. Our employees love them."
Home,5.0,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ""GOING STRONG OVER A YEAR""","I have read so many complaints about this product and I am surprised. I have 2 swivel sweepers (buy 1 get 1 free)for over 1 year now and everything is going great. It will pickup cereal, noodles, dust and more. I followed the manufactures suggestions on the batteries and all is good. I don't let the batteries charge for more than 6 hrs. I use mine on wood and ceramic tile floors and throw carpets. I have thicker carpet so I don't use it for that. If my dies, I will buy the new one they came out with.  Good luck to everyone!"
Home,2.0,"Great for cat hair, but ridiculously short battery life.","I have two cats, and I was amazed at how well this little sweeper picked up cat hair I couldn't even see. It didn't pick up much else, but that was ok with me since cat hair is my biggest housecleaning problem. I had been singing the praises of my sweeper to anyone who would listen, but the other day, the battery completely died. I can't recharge it at all, and the sweeper isn't even three months old. I had read the directions before I used the sweeper, so I was careful not to overcharge the battery, but it is completely dead now anyway. I hope I can find another cordless sweeper that is as convenient but much more reliable. It's a real disappointment to find something so good that is made so poorly."
Home,1.0,Piece of junk,"I had to sweep at least 3 or 4 times to pick up everything on the floor.  After charging about 10 times, the battery no longer charged.  Lousy quality.  I threw it in the trash can last week.  My vacuum cleaner does a much better job on both carpet and hardwood floor.  It's very light, but most vacuum cleaners have wheels, it's really not that bad.  Don't trust what you see in the TV commercials."
Home,5.0,Great Sweeper!,"I received this sweeper as a Christmas gift almost two years ago and I absolutely love it! If you are expecting a vacuum, you will be disappointed, it has no suction, however if you want to use it as a sweeper, it's great! The best part in my opinion is that I don't ever actually have to use it! My 6 and 8 year old children are the first to volunteer to sweep the kitchen floor and clean up their messes when they dump popcorn, crush chips on the floor, or whatever. I always had to take care of those messes before because my kids have no concept of how to sweep dirt into piles, or get it into a dust pan. I love how it recharges because they can run it all they want without using electricity or running down batteries. Over the almost two years I have had it I have noticed that the battery life is somewhat less than it was, but it still runs on fairly heavy use for a couple of days before I have to recharge. I have found it light, easy to use, and easy to empty. My mother in law even bought one for her camp to use on the hardwood floors after using mine."
Home,4.0,Good product...,This is great for quick and light clean up.  My kids love to use it too.  It's easy to get corners and under tables and chairs.
Home,3.0,Art of Paper Quilling,[[ASIN:1592533868 Art of Paper Quilling: Designing Handcrafted Gifts and Cards]] A beginner could use this book as it has basic instructions for most  of the techniques. What I like about the book is it covers a wide variety of quilled pieces from cards to boxes. It also has a newer technique for hand fringed flowers. The pictures of the finished designs and the techniques are large and clear. It is a nice addition to a paper quilling library.
Home,4.0,Art of Paper Quilling,I was totally satisfied with the book and the shape of the used book.  Thanks.
Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper is Great for hard-surface floors,"I am very pleased with the Swivel Sweeper.  I've bought 3 so far [me and friends].  They're great on hard-surfaced floors --with great edging capabilities.  They are not good on carpet with any kind of pile, though.  They're ok for super-short, outdoor mat-type rugs, but you can tell it's harder on the little motor.  I wouldn't use it on large sections of outdoor carpeting.  Be sure to get the more current model that includes the little magnetic catch so the sweeper head can be folded up more easily for closet storage."
Home,5.0,Paper Quilling,I had borrowed the book from my local public library and knew I had to purchase it.  Very informative and very good instructions on the art of Paper Quilling.  Love it.
Home,5.0,Wonderful & Inspiring!,"This book definitely is the best quilling book I own or seen in stores.  The projects in the book range from simple to complex.  The workmanship is neat and exquisite, a great model to follow.  There are some techniques that I have not seen elsewhere that produce interesting effects.  The gallery of the author's work is wonderful and inspiring.  I hope she would publish a book on how to create those large, complex pieces of quilling artworks.  I'd like to try creating one of those heirloom-quality quilling artworks and proudly hang on my wall.  The \\""Art\\"" of Paper Quilling is a very fitting title for the book.      Update:  The book has folded roses that are much prettier then roses in other books.  However, the directions on page 24 were not detailed enough for me to follow and produce a good looking rose like the ones in the book.  I emailed Claire asking for step-by-step instructions.  She replied with a video she recorded demonstrating the folded rose.  Absolutely wonderful!  Seeing it done once is a thousand times better then reading instructions on how it should be done.  After seeing the video, I was able to create folded roses just like the ones in the book."
Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper served me well,"My first swivel sweeper just died after two years of hard use picking up animal hair and dust from the desert here in AZ.

Home,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE !,"What a waste of money !  I fell for the TV ad, which promised me 2 of them for the price of one.  Well, I got them.  One, of course, was broken.   It was too hard to find a real person to complain to and I had lost my reciept.  Anyway, Im glad that I had the Extra battery .  This thing runs out of charge before a large room is done, and i need to switch batteries.  Not only that, it is made so cheaply that sometimes it just comes apart, and all the debris comes out of the holding compartment unexpectedly.  It does okay with crumbs and that type of thing, but it wont even pick up paper shreds !   My house is full of kids and alot of my problem is little bits of wrappers and various paper trash left around.  My old dirt devil worked way better.  Of course, that didnt last a year either.  I guess theres no quick way to do this.  Get out the real vaccuum."

Home,5.0,Great choice for Hardwood Floor owners with furry pets,"Right to the details...<br /><br />^+++ The Pros +++^<br />+ Lightweight, easy to carry around<br />+ While the brushes are spinning, the sweeper feels like it's gliding and nearly weightless on the floor.<br />+ Well balanced (battery is at a little past 1/2 way down the handle to counter-balance the weight of the sweeper<br />+ Low profile, swivel design makes it a champ for getting easily under furniture and into tough areas<br />+ Excellent at getting into the corners<br />+ Comes with a hair/tangle cutting tool<br />+ The rotating brush design does double duty; rotation of the brushes pulls the debris into the sweeper for collection and at the same does some light duty brush-up on the floor to loosen some items up for collectionx<br /><br />^--- The Cons ---^<br />- The battery is made up of 6 X AA rechargeable batteries inside and the charger charges at 200mA. If the charge time is rated at 6-8hours that makes the capacity at something around 1500mAH. Not exactly the highest capacity batteries available.<br />- Also, the 200mA charger isn't a \\""smart\\"" charger, it doesn't automatically turn off when the batteries are charged (hence the warning in the manuals that the batteries shouldn't be left on the charger for 24hrs or more)<br />- While it does an excellent job on hardwood, the Swivel Sweeper is nearly worthless on carpeted areas.<br /><br />*** Conclusion ***<br />If you're a pet owner and have hardwood floors then you're likely familiar with the \\""tumbleweeds\\"" of fur that no matter how often you vacuum or use the brush for, they just keep showing back up (ahhh, what a joy being a pet owner can be sometimes huh?).<br /><br />Especially frustrating is trying to keep up with cleaning the areas under the furniture, on the stairs and in the corners. Our Dyson vacuum has great suction, but it's a hassle for doing light work or getting at stuff under the furniture. The broom is good for getting into corners but then you're always bending down to scoop up the dirt, which the dustbin never fully is able to pick up all the fine dirt. Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.<br /><br />We've also tried the hybrid broom/vacuum, but it was essentially the worst of both worlds. It was inept at getting under furniture and the suction power was weak.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper turned out to be fantastic (on hardwood). There's no suction to it, instead, the rotation of the brushes pulls all the dust/dirt/hair into the collection chamber. Kind of like why you'd want mud flaps on your car because while the wheels are turning all the mud, snow, rocks and such are kicked up against the car body.<br /><br />Along with the \\""kick-up\\"" collection method, the swivel head allows for the sweeper to literally be used at a 180degree angle. Which makes getting under furniture an absolutely menial task and you can get the sweeper as far under furniture as you can reach your arm!<br /><br />I should stress again that this is all on hardwood, the couple of times I tried using the sweeper on carpet the brushes could never spin up to full speed so the \\""kick-up\\"" power was diminished and since the brushes had to work that much harder, the battery doesn't last nearly as long.<br /><br />If you have hardwood floors and especially if you have pets that produce fur tumbleweeds like we do, then I wholeheartedly suggest this Swivel Sweeper!Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.

Home,4.0,Great!  But it's not a vacuum cleaner...,"This is a great product.  I've had it for 6 months and I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure why some people have problems with the pole.  I use it all the time to pick up messes.  Please do not expect it to replace your vacuum cleaner or your broom and dust pan.  This product is not intended to sweep your whole house.  The battery doesn't last that long and the little dust pan is small.  What this is great for is to pick up in between cleanings.  Do you ever have company over and little pieces of chips spill on the carpet?  And have you ever had to drag out the vacuum cleaner to vacuum the area where your guests were, like the living room or dining area?  Or do you have small kids and they spill around the kitchen table?  Then you'll love this.  It's light and doesn't require plugging in.  Pull it out, sweep the mess, clean out the tray, and put it away.  For that, I love it.  It's like a broom for your carpet.  I don't expect it to clean my whole house."
Home,2.0,Bad Customer Service!!!,Sweeper came with a defective battery have made several requests for fresh/new one!!! Still no response and no new battery!!!
Home,2.0,Works good at first,"After a few months of using the sweeper, it no longer works for more than 30 seconds because the battery no longer charges properly. I used this on mainly hardwood and on some rug. After a while it's very troublesome to clean because hair easily gets tangled in the vac which in turn breaks the vac down. It is also very flimsy and plastic and so if you push it hard it overturns and all that you vacuumed -dirt, crumbs, etc. flies out, and you're left with an even greater mess to clean up. Rip-off. Get a vac at much better deals on Amazon or at Target."
Home,4.0,It's not the battery that is the problem.,"I love my swivel sweeper and I've read a LOT of reviews on this.  People are under the impression that it's the battery that goes bad after a while.  It does appear that way BUT, that's not really the problem.  I bought a new battery and it didn't work any better than the old one.  I then found the SS on clearance for $15 (with coupon discount) so I bought another.  I tested both the old battery and the new in the new unit and there was no difference.  The problem is that the cleaning unit itself builds up dirt.  My husband took the whole assembly apart on the old unit cleaned and lubed it and now it is working almost like new with either the old or new batteries.  Try it!"
Home,1.0,Faulty charger,I bought this last week and the charger never worked. I'm glad I was able to get my money back so I can just buy a shark like I should have in the first place.
Home,5.0,Important: Do not charge the battery for more than 24 hours,"I asked for my sweeper and received it as a wedding shower gift at the suggestion of my sister, busy mom of 3 kids under 5 (who swears by her sweeper).<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints that the swivel sweeper does not hold a charge.  I am not one to read directions, but I happened across someone who mentioned a line of the directions when I was reading reviews for the sweeper.  Seeing as how so many people are still giving negative reviews, I thought it worth reposting.<br /><br />You cannot charge the battery for more than 24 hours consecutively.  Plug it in, and unplug it after a day.  My sweeper has worked great for over 2 years with heavy use.  I don't know why this makes a difference, but the people who follow these instructions have not had any issues and love their sweeper.  Of course, you would never know this if you don't read all of the instructions.<br /><br />The swivel sweeper is not a vacuum.  It's an electric broom.  It's not meant to take the place of a vacuum... it's good for cleaning up debris before you clean the floor (like a broom!).  I've even used it to clean hair off the kitchen floor after at-home haircuts.  One swipe and the mess is gone.  It's awesome at sweeping up Christmas tree needles and crumbly messes.  You still need to vacuum your rugs, but this helps with the quick messes in between.  I hope this helps you feel more confident about the sweeper."
Home,5.0,Not Sure What You People Are Doing,"I'm a bit surprised too at some of these reviews.  I know, as a TV product, it's commercial can be a bit deceptive.  If you think this is going to replace a sweeper you use over your WHOLE house, forget it.  If you're using it that way, yeah, you probably will burn out a charge faster than you can believe.  That's not what this is for.  The Swivel Sweeper is for LIGHT MESSES.  We live in an apartment and use this every day for quick cleaning.  For this, it's incredible.  It picks up items quickly, rarely needs cleaning, and makes going over everything with a vacuum unnecessary except for big cleaning days.  I've had no technical problems with it at all.  I cleaned out the brushes for the first time in six months of use, and even then it was working fine before I did it.  At times, yes, it did push around some of the dirt, but since it swivels, all I do is turn the handle and the header moves around in a circle, catching whatever problem I may have.  Occasionally there may be a few heavier pieces here and there in a corner that I can't get with it, but it does its job just fine.  I spot clean with it all over the place, perfect for when people drop by unexpectedly and there may be some crumbs lying about.  I really don't have any problems with this item at all.  If you're looking for a way to eliminate a dust pan, I think it's great.  Looking to eliminate a vacuum, NO WAY.  Prehaps I'm just lucky with it."
Home,4.0,To prevent over charging,"Overcharging will kill a most types of rechargables.  A good charger like on a cell phone won't overcharge but a less expensive like this one can.    Use an mechanical light timer the type with a little plastic insert to set the on/off time.  They are $4-10.  Remove all the \\""on\\"" tabs.  Set the time to noon and put the \\""off\\"" tab at midnight.  Plug the charger into this.  When you want a charge twist the dial around to noon and flip the little knob to turn it on.  In 12 hours it will turn off and stay off till you reset it."
Home,2.0,Doesn't Last,"I saw this litte sweeper reviewed on TV.  They said it did a great job, so I bought one.  They were right!  It did a great job - for a while.  Now even though I charge the battery, it goes really slow and hardly picks up anything.  I'm not sure why - it seems like the battery won't even charge or something....."
Home,3.0,Just okay...,This product worked great at first. I thought it was going to be a lifesaver to help me quickly pick up dog hair off of our hardwood floors daily. It did...for the first few months. It doesn't work anymore and I'm going to *try* a replacement battery in the hopes that this solves the problem. It may just be the battery doesn't charge fully anymore.    What it is good for:    Pet hair  Light dirt    What it is bad for:    Dust bunnies (blows them away!)  Bird feathers (same thing)  Larger pieces of dirt such as a spilled houseplant  Throw rugs (get sucked up and unit stops)  Any area that happens to be dirty and damp at the same time.
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper works!,Swivel sweeper does the job. A very strong pick up for a battery operated device. The swiveling action allows you to get into even those hard to reach corners and it's very easy to clean. You just pop out the back and empty.
Home,5.0,Great Little Sweeper!,"This little sweeper does exactly as advertised!  It's not a major cleaning device - and wasn't intended to be one.  It's a quick and easy picker-upper and it works just great for that.  We have hardwood flooring and a few low mat carpets in the living and dinning rooms - and we use this little baby daily for the simple and quick clean-ups - it's so light and easy to retrieve that it's a pleasure to use.  In a couple minutes, all of the daily crumbs and debris are gone.  For heavy cleaning we bring out the Hoover.  Battery live is actually very impressive compared to other battery cleaning devices (my Dustbuster gives out after about 45 secs - this device has not petered out on me yet even after 15 minutes straight use).  Note: I bought this in 2007, so maybe they fixed the battery problem.    Drawbacks - it gets hung-up on higher pile carpet and will lock-up.  It needs to be emptied frequently.  And, hair and fabrics get tangled in the rotor brushes and need to be cleaned often.    Hint - buy a new one on Ebay for under $20.00 and avoid the infomercial shipping/handling/ and BS that goes along with it.  I got mine new for $18 and a reasonable shipping charge."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper is Great for Small Cleanups,"Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is a small but very useful electric vacuum cleaner that is designed to handle less extreme messes with little effort. The majority of the messes experienced in most households are small in size, but frequent in number. This is precisely why the Swivel Sweeper is so useful. It tackles small jobs with ease and it packs a greater punch than most other vacuums of similar size.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper offers many reasons to recommend it, but the main reason this vacuum is superior to others is its cleaning head. It features brushes on all sides. Even large, heavy duty vacuum cleaners do not have brushes on every side of the vacuum head. Swivel Sweeper has them everywhere and they rotate a full 360 degrees. Thus, no matter how you turn the head, the crumbs and other waste will get sucked into the vacuum. There is no second effort needed.<br /><br />Since the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is intended for smaller jobs and since it isn't very large, it obviously doesn't have much storage space for the dust and other particles it picks up from the floor. This means it requires more frequent emptying of the waste container. It is a pretty easy process, given that the receptacle is hinged. All you do is push the inner red tabs to dump the contents. Once the contents are emptied, you just snap it shut and the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is ready for its next use. This will have to be done frequently because the container is so small, but at least the process is simple and doesn't require purchasing disposable bags.<br /><br />The Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is great for cleaning up messes on tile or hardwood floors, but I have noticed that its use is limited on carpets. Even on a very flat carpet, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner seems to be doing all it can to operate, and you will quickly notice a deepening and slowing in the sound as the brushes spin their wheels, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs. The vacuum becomes a tad lethargic on carpets and has limited usefulness in this capacity. The power will be lost more quickly and a single charge will not last very long. One thing you should not use the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner on is shag carpeting. Very few people go shag nowadays, but if you are one of the few who owns shag, do not use this vacuum on your carpet. It will not be able to dig deeply enough to clean the carpet the way it should be cleaned.<br /><br />One nice safety device with the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is its auto- shutoff. If you attempt to pick up something that is too large or too stringy and it causes the brushes to stop turning, the vacuum will automatically shut off. This is good, because it means the motor will not burn out and the charge will not be exhausted too quickly. I have had this experience when I tried to pick up some string. It was longer than I estimated and it got stuck. I had to pull the string out manually, but the vacuum stopped immediately, so there was no damage done to the motor.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is a very good little vacuum cleaner that offers greater capabilities than other sweepers of its size and style. It can't replace the large, more powerful vacuum cleaners, but it wasn't intended for large scale use. It is intended for small jobs and among the vacuums in its class, it ranks as one of the best around.s, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs.

Home,3.0,"Disappointing Performance, Awkward to Use","I found the Swivel Sweeper a bit disappointing.  For years, I had been using a similar product (Shark cordless sweeper, Europro cordless sweeper) which I liked very much.  When the battery on the other one died, I decided to try this one. By comparison I find this one seriously lacking.    Price: With a current retail price around $35, the price is excellent. In full disclosure, the product I liked much better was quite a bit higher, but I would still recommend the other one.    Effectiveness: Marginal. This product simply does not pick up everything in one or even multiple passes. I've tried it on both sealed hardwood and ceramic tile. In both cases it picked up most but not all of the dirt and debris, leaving little bits behind here and there. I'm not talking about large or heavy or unusual items here. I mean it picked up some dirt and skipped right over other bits of dirt. It seemed no matter how many times I ran it back and forth in all kinds of directions, I never got a totally clean floor.  While it is picking up some debris, it seems to push or blow other debris out of its path making it next to impossible to get everything.  By comparison the more expensive product has edge cleaning brushes which reach out and grab debris in front of and beside the unit. This one does not have that feature.    Ergonomics and Design: Serious design problems.       1. The dirt cup is very shallow and quite small. It does not hold very much. You will need to dump this frequently to keep the unit working, especially if you are picking up things like pet hair, dust bunnies, the occasional autumn leaf tracked in, etc.       2. The design makes it difficult to remove and dump the dirt cup without spilling it. Picture this. You've got this 6ft or so handle that will readily 'fall' down if you hold the sweeper base w/o supporting the handle. To release the dirt cup you need to use your thumb and forefinger of one hand to pinch the release mechanism on the sweeper base while simultaneously supporting the dirt cup with the other hand; otherwise, the dirt cup will drop to the floor. Because you cannot possibly support the handle while doing so, it will 'fall' clumsily downward.  Now you are still holding the sweeper base by the release mechanism between thumb and forefinger on one hand while the handle dangles awkwardly behind you. In the other hand you have the dirt cup which needs to be emptied. If it is at all full, with dust bunnies and such, a bit of dirt and debris will likely spill over the sides while you are trying to get it to the trash can to dump it.  Then you have to start over.       3. It is equally difficult to put the dirt cup back after dumping it. The dirt cup fits under the bottom. It has to be lined up properly to snap into place, but you cannot see what you are doing under there unless you turn the cleaner and dirt cup upside down - which will likely result in more dust and debris on the floor. You can put the dirt cup back while holding the unit upright and without seeing what you are doing, but it is a bit awkward until you get the hand of it. The cup will only fit in one direction. While holding things upright you cannot see which way it needs to go or how things are lining up. In my opinion, not the best design.  My other unit had a cup that slid in from the side, a much better design.       4. The handle will not stand upright without support. This makes the unit very awkward to work with. You can't just leave the unit standing while you walk away for something, and if you try to lean it agains the wall it will likely slide/fall down.If you buy this, expect to spend a lot of time bending down to pick the handle up off the floor. You will get a great workout.       5. I did not find the sliders to be an asset. My other unit had traditional wheels and worked great. Not only did the sliders not enhance the efficiency of the product, but I was inclined to worry that they might contribute to scratching the hardwood floors bypushing sand, dirt, debris across the floor.       6. Does not work at all well on carpet, not even low pile, indoor/outdoor types. In all fairness the item is not advertised for use on carpet; however, my other unit worked very well on carpet. This one 'sticks' or hangs up on the carpet, and with the easily bendable handle it can be impossible to push across the carpet. Since I have a mix of hardwood, tile, ceramic tile, carpet, and wool rugs, I find it cumbersome to have to use another method for the carpet and rugs.    Summary:  I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to anyone unless they just couldn't afford anything else.  If you are looking for a cordless sweeper I would recommend something similar to the Shark Cordless Sweeper. There may well be other brands that work as well or better. The Shark (and Europro) is the only other one I have tried. By comparison, I would definitely recommend the Shark over this product.    Pros: Excellent price. You can afford to try it. Even if you don't like it you haven't lost a lot of money.  Cons: Poor pickup, must be emptied often, awkward to work with, doesn't work on carpet, sliders add little value and are primarily hype."
Home,1.0,Another Dead Battery,I can only add my bad experience to all of the other negative reviews here.

Home,5.0,The Best Quilling Book Ever,I've been quilling for a few months and was totally bored with all the little cutsie patterns and projects and didn't want to get into quilling marriage documents or birth anouncements. Everything I saw was based on the idea that you were a beginner who wasn't really interested in this craft until I found this book. The author is amazing! She is without a doubt the finest quiller I have ever seen. Her work has inspired me to expand on my own with new ideas and techniques. Her projects take you step by step through each section in clear and easy to understand directions to a finished piece that you wouldn't mind giving as a gift or framing for your own wall. There is a gallery of quilling in the back of the book that shows pieces I would never have believed were made from paper except that now I know how to do them myself from reading her book. I am working on a project now that uses 6 new techniques that I have never found in any other quilling book. It's a three demensional flower arrangement of my own design and every time I look at it I am amazed that I am the one who created it. Quilling is fun again! This book showed me that I have only just scratched the surface of this amazing craft. Thank you Claire Sun-ok Choi for taking the time to share your knowledge.
Home,4.0,Works Great,I have had mine for a few weeks now and use it every day and have yet to reacharge it so it does hold its charge.  It works well for what it is intended for.  We have a 1 year old and we use it to clean up the crumbs and mess he leaves under his high chair and all around the kitchen and on the carpet as well.  I recommend it for anyone with a baby who is looking for something to quickly pick up food left on the floor.  Our 1 year old loves to push it around as well which makes cleaning even easier!
Home,3.0,"Sweeper, Amazing.... Battery, CRAP!!","I have no problems with the sweeper, it's designed well, it works as advertised. It picks up dirt from all four directions and I'm surprised at the amount of stuff it picked up from the kitchen floor that I didn't even know was there.    The battery was OBVIOUSLY provided by the lowest bidder.  I've had my sweeper for less than a year and I leave the battery on the charger overnight, take the battery off the charger and place it in the sweeper and turn it on.... the sweeper runs slower than a turtle with 3 bad feet going uphill...    A higher quality battery may increase the cost from the beloved \\""as-seen-on-tv price of $19.95, but it would have DEFINITELY improved my rating of this product.     Now... off to spend another ten bucks on a new battery..."
Home,5.0,Stunning,"Wow, this is a thorough and lovely book.  Though not unlike others of the genre, The Art of Paper Quilling includes a goodly amount of information on the topic including: history of the art, discussion of paper types, list of equipment and its purpose, important supplies, and additional non-quilling techniques.  She does not cover preservative methods other than that designs may be mounted and framed, nor does she--or anyone else--suggest any clever methods of getting a quilled gift card safely through the postal system.<br /><br />The author provides, not only photographed collections of shapes but, a detailed written description of the techniques required to render them.  Her designs show a pronounced sense of color and texture, and while she presents some designs specific to special occasions, the overall collection is definitely directed to a general audience and a multiplicity of purposes.<br /><br />Most of the quilling techniques are illustrated in one or more of the author's projects, which allows the student to practice them, and there are projects at all levels of experience, so that the more advanced student will also find a challenge.  Patterns and templates are found at the back of the book for the student's use, and they include patterns for a sachet package and for boxes of heart, oval and square shapes.<br /><br />Although there were some designs I felt were a little awkward (place cards on p. 107 and 109) or lacked something (as the greeting card on p. 58), I found most of her work stunning.  I was particularly impressed with the display of butterflies introducing the gallery photos, and may try some of them myself.  I really, really loved the boxes--I'm crazy about boxes anyway--and will definitely try some of them.  In thinking in terms of alternative uses, I ntoed that many of the designs would make gorgeous cake decorations, something that might be kept as a memento of a special occasion.<br /><br />I really loved this book."
Home,3.0,It's just OK,"I've had this unit for about a year now. I bought extra batteries right from the get go, because I know how these battery powered/rechargables are. Nothing worse than needing to use it, and finding the battery is dead, and you have to wait 6 hours for it to charge.<br />Anyway, for quick crumb pick ups on NON-SCULPTED / NON-LOOP STYLE TYPE CARPETS OR on hardwood/laminate/tile/vinyl foors is OK.<br />If you have looped carpeting, and you get a snag.....  it will rip the carpet loops right out. Also, if you have sculpted carpet, the brushs cant grab the crumbs sitting lower, since this doesnt use SUCTION.....only brush power to lift up the crumbs.<br />The worst part of this unit is the size of the collection cup. IT'S HORRIBLE. It MIGHT hold 1/2 cup dirt of fuzz. If you forget to empty it every 5 minutes ( if your battery holds out that long) it wont pick up any more dirt.  No WHEELS either. It's got those teflon pads on the bottom. It does swivel, it is light, it does have a long handle and it does do a nice job picking up crumbs and small debris, but it DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE of a good vacuum."
Home,4.0,Wonderful item,This is a must have for my cleaning chores. It works great and gets under the edges of the counters and many other places that it is so hard to get with a regular vacume. Light weight and manuvers easily.
Home,4.0,Battery Charging Hints,"DO NOT use sweeper (out of box) until battery is charged for 8 hrs (NO LONGER THAN 8 hrs)!!!  DO NOT recharge battery until fully drained of power  DO NOT re-charge for more than 6 to 8 hrs....Battery MUST be taken off charger!!!!!  or start buying battery after battery...also that 24 hrs crap, only weakens batteries  and guess who makes the replacement batteries!! Remember..(NO MORE THAN 6 to 8 HR RE-CHARGE!!)   Another problem is string and thread gets wrapped around moving parts and must be removed..  This will stop sweeper and shorten battery life!!"
Home,1.0,If you have pets DON'T Bother,"I bought this little sweeper purely to pick up dog fur off the hardwood floor in between cleaning with a real vacuum.  I brought it home and couldn't wait to use it. My floor was relatively clean, I had just vacuumed the night before, and when I went over the floor with this sweeper it didn't pick up any of the dog hair. It pushed it around or got caught in the front.  Let me repeat, it couldn't pick up a few strands of dog hair!  If you have any animals I would suggest using a brush and dustpan over this piece of junk."
Home,1.0,Don't buy this,"This vacuum is very lightweight but is not well made. The plastic is so thin that the plastic cover broke the first week (I was pretty careful.)    The battery charged for enough time to finish cleaning our kitchen and I was satisfied with what it picked up. However, if you swivel it (and that's what it is known for), it often flips over - especially on stairs. If it flips over or comes off the ground or even tilts at all, the dirt in the cup comes spewing out and you need a heavy duty vacuum to clean it up. Sounds like this wouldn't happen often but it does.  After using it every day for a few months, it just died.  I had a Bissel version of this and that one didn't last long either.  These things are cheap but I hate that we are putting them in landfills and that I'm paying for a new one every few months.      Is it that hard to make something that works longer than 3-4 months?"
Home,1.0,Stay away,"Stay away from these guys ,30 days and still have not received my order. They never answer email. I have filed clam with Amazon waiting for answer.ONCE AGAIN STAY AWAY DON'T ORDER FROM THEM."
Home,5.0,Corless Swivel Sweeper,"[[ASIN:B0007MWZEK Cordless Swivel Sweeper - As Seen on TV]]  It is a quick pick-up instead of dragging out the large regular vacuum. It is lightweight and for me with Fibromyalgia, means less pain and I can clean-up more often.  Picks up everything on tile, linoleum and hardwood floors; which is great since I have 3 dogs and plenty of dust bunnies.  I feel my home is cleaner due to the Cordless Swivel Sweeper."
Home,2.0,"Swivel Sweeper good, Battery charger bad.",The Swivel Sweeper is good but the charger is bad. It has no overcharge protection and has fried two batteries for me. A 7 hr charge on a new battery produced about 6 feet of sweeping and quit. I will go back to my  Elect. Broom with a cord.
Home,1.0,Haven't gotten my swivel sweeper yet,Haven't gotten my swivel sweeper yet. And it is really ghey.  I have used the swivel sweeper before and it as a product is pretty freakin sweet. That is why I am dissapointed it hasn't come yet.
Home,3.0,A great little vacume -When it works,"I have owned my Swivel sweeper for 2 years now. When it works it is amazing. I love how light it is - my 18 month old could push it around. It is able to go under almost every piece of furnature without haveing to move it and it gets into courners beautifully. It's easy to empty and easy to clean.    Here's the rub, the directions explicitly say not to charge the battery over 8 hours, but if you're like me you naturally charge everything else (phones PDAs camera batteries ect) overnight so you have a freash chage in the morning. If you leave the battery on the charger too long it KILLS the batery. I was very careful witht eh first battery and it only lasted me 1 year. My second battery is barely holding on to life - it will work for maybe 20 seconds before dying. At $10 a pop I cannot afford to keep buying batteries, and as a busy mom I cannot keep track of a high maintance battery that needs to be coddled and taken off the charger after an hour."
Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper,I purchased this product for my son because I have (2) swivel sweepers and love it so much I wanted him to have one also. Most of my floors are ceramic and we also have 4 cats with lots of hair and cat litter. The Swivel Sweeper picks up all particles on the floor. I find that my floors are much cleaner because I don't have to get the broom and dust pan out to clean.
Home,3.0,Possible solution to problem with Battery,"I purchased this sweeper about 6 months ago - I believe it is the older model.  It worked great - I thought it was the best thing I'd ever purchased - it is great for going into small areas I can't get a normal vacuum, and I don't have to bother with cords.  I have a small 2 bedroom house with all hardwood floors and tile, so it was pretty much all I needed to sweep up the floors each week.  I liked it so well I even bought one for my parents for Christmas.  You do have to be careful to pick up any string or power cords, or drape cords because it will pick them up and they will get lodged in there easily.    However, 2 weeks ago, the product stopped running after only partially finishing the house - before that I could clean my house at least once on a battery charge.  I did leave the battery charging a little too long one time and I thought that was the problem.  I ordered a brand new battery - thinking with a spare I'd have plenty of power to finish the house, even if I'd shortened the life of the first battery.  I charged the new battery. I started with the old, and that ran about 7 minutes and the sweeper stopped, and I put the new charged battery in. It ran for a couple minutes and quit.  I emptied it and cleaned out hair from the bottom and could run it again for 30 seconds and it would stop again. The bottom felt hot.  It's not under warranty anymore so I decided since it was not working to take it apart and see if there was any way I could clean it better. It was pretty easy - there are several screws on the bottom that are visible, and 4 more that are under the 4 white plastic balls on the bottom. I carefully (keeping track of the order of the parts and how they went together) took apart the brushes and gears and cleaned out hair and a thread that was stuck in the gears and reassembled it so things moved freely.  It appears to work just like new on the same battery charge that was running out 30 minutes earlier.  It even did the carpets in my house that I had not tried for awhile.  My guess is that it was overheating because the hair and thread were stuck in the gears and making the machine have to work hard to turn the gears and causing it to overheat before the battery was dead.  I will know next time when I use it to clean the whole house if I have fixed it - that it was not just a case of allowing it time to cool down.  It was a fairly simple to do what I did - not hard to disassemble and reassemble if you paid attention to where the parts go. I would not try this if the warranty was still valid, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I did take the battery out first to be safe. If for some reason I still have trouble next time and it ends up just being a bad part, I will post a comment - but I mainly wanted to say that you may think the battery may be your problem if it stops but it may not be.  Let it cool down for a half hour and try it again on the same battery and see if it runs for while and that will tell you if the battery may be bad. I figure it is one of two things - the hair etc. was making it work extra hard and overheat (that is what I suspect) - or just stopping it from turning, or a just a bad part in there that is overheating - we will see.  I did not do a good job of cleaning it out regularly and I will now.  I thought this info might be helpful to someone. It's worth a try before throwing it away or spending alot to fix or replace parts."
Home,3.0,Overall Opinion,We are on our 4th swivel sweeper. It goes in places our vacuum can't get to. It's light. We use it daily.Our regular vacuum once a week. It's ease of use is impressive. The downside. The batteries don't hold up as long as we would like. The plastic gears wear out requireing we buy a new sweeper every now and then. The one we have now purchased thru Amazon is a second. The Batteriy on the handle is not in the right place making it harder to use. Also some of the brushes are missing. However the overall ease of use makes it a further buy.
Home,2.0,It is only good for light housekeeping. Not major messes like I make at times.,This product is for light housekeeping.  It is not for the major messes that I make regularly.  It is truely a light and flexible piece of equipmnet.  It is not designed to clean the entire house in on shot.  It is ideal for touch up cleaning.
Home,5.0,Works well to keep roomba contained,"This item works in keeping your roomba in a contained space/rooom, just remember roomba will only work with 3 of these at a time.  I did not know that until after I had purchased a total of 4 lighthouses."
Home,5.0,Works great!,"I bought this so that my 5yr. old son could learn to sweep and he loves it. It works great and is easy to empty. He knows how to plug the battery in and how to recharge it, so I'm very happy with my purchase."
Home,3.0,Swivel Sweeper,"I'm not unhappy with my Swivel Sweeper, but if I knew then what I know now, I'd probably pass up its purchase. It's VERY good for getting under beds between those times when someone with muscles is around to move furniture for you. You still have to get down on the floor to do that, though, which at my age isn't much fun. It picks up really well, but I hate cleaning it. The handle is kinda flimsy, but works well if you don't whip it around all over the place. It holds its charge as I'd expect it to do for it's size, and it's great on throw rugs that have the latex backing. What you see on TV is what you get. The only thing you don't see on the commercials is that it's a noisy little bugger. And, I agree, it's over-priced."
Home,4.0,Recommend,"Very please with overall experience, it does tend to slow down and work harder to pick up from carpeting"
Home,3.0,"Works well, except for dog hair.","I haven't had any difficultly with this product, except it's no good with dog hair. The hair gets wrapped around the brushes constantly and is very difficult and time consuming to remove from the brushes. It's fine for crumbs and other small bits, but not hair.<br /><br />The location of the battery makes it hard to get under beds, etc. But they have a new version that folds the bar down, so that should help."
Home,4.0,Love it!,"It is so lightweight, easy to use and amazingly picks up pretty well.  Love it for quick spills or a once over the hardwood floors and carpets before company.  I have cats and it really picks up the hair.    Don't like how it empties..clumsy and have had the contents on the floor when trying to empty it."
Home,4.0,Dosn't work as well as the last one I bought,"This is my second swivel sweeper. I use it to sweep floors in my restaraunt and have really put it to the test. I love It,  It is so easy to push and picks up dirt very well. The problem is the batteries don't last. The battery only lasts about 10-15 min. before you have to plug it in again.  The first one I bought the battery lasted much longer,  So either I got a dud or the product is inconsistent."
Home,5.0,My most beautiful quilling book,"Quilling, or the art of paper filigree doesn't require much in the way of expensive tools.  You could even start off with narrow strips from a mini paper shredder (the author's suggestion), plus glue, scissors, tweezers, straight pins, and something to roll the paper strips around, such as a toothpick or an awl.<br /><br />\\""The Art of Paper Quilling\\"" is a good guide to start with, and it is also the most beautiful quilling book I've had the opportunity to read.  Most of its projects use 1/8\\"" (3 mm)-wide strips, but the one I wanted to try right away, \\""A Blue Cornflower and Daisy Arrangement\\"" involved cut-out and fringed petals, plus a fringed center using ¼\\"" (6 mm)-wide strips.  A fringing tool would be very useful for many of this book's projects, if you don't want the tedium of fringing strips by hand.<br /><br />The patterns in this guide vary from 60% of actual size to full-size.  (I wish authors would stick to full-size patterns, but I suppose this isn't always possible).  They range from simple to complex, but even the complex designs consist of a few varieties of paper coils, repeated many times.  Most of the projects involve flowers and/or butterflies, but there are also a few Christmas designs and a pair of Easter bunnies.  The finished quillwork is used to decorate picture frames, plaques, boxes, greeting cards, and gift bags (sachets).<br /><br />Colored photographs decorate this 128-page craft book, including a gallery of paper quilling art by Claire Sun-ok Choi in its final pages.  I am especially fond of her fanciful, multi-colored butterflies.  This author has also published \\""[[ASIN:1592530362 Designing Handcrafted Cards: Step-by-Step Techniques for Crafting 60 Beautiful Cards]]\\"" (2004)."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,This is my second swivel sweeper.  It works wonders.  It cleans well. In between sweeping with my regular vaccuum it picks up the dirt and makes my house look clean a fresh.
Home,5.0,Effective at controlling Roomba's operations,"These are worth having if your Roomba did not come with then or not with enough of them.<br /><br />When set as a virtual wall, it will not allow Roomba to enter certain areas such as the bathroom.<br /><br />When in Lighthouse mode, Roomba will pass through into another room and, after done with cleaning there, it will guide it back to the charging station.<br /><br />Depending on how wide the passages you need to protect/signal, it can be set to 0-3ft., 4-7ft. or 8+ft.<br /><br />It requires 2 C-cell batteries.<br /><br />It seems to be 100% effective as a virtual wall when placed properly and close to 100% effective as a lighthouse."
Home,5.0,"machine good, but the customer service was even better","this product is great for me, I'm 65 years old and it is hard to move the big vaccuum around, this little item really helps get up the cat hair all around the house.  But the first one I received was defective, the company worked with me trying to figure where the problem was. Then they sent me a new one and said to just keep the other one for spare parts.  They are certainly the best company I have worked with on Amazon so far.  They went out of there way to work with me and answered every email I sent to them.  I would recommend them to anyone.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
Home,4.0,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!","I really do love this sweeper.  It beats sweeping my hardwoods with the \\""old fashion\\"" broom.  I like the fact that it fits in tight spaces and turns on a dime.  The only negative I would say is that the battery life is not that great.  After only 4-5 uses, I am recharging it.  But a good buy for your dollar!"
Home,5.0,Great Little Sweeper!,This is a great little sweeper for light cleaning. It works good on hardwood floors as well as carpet.
Home,2.0,Yuck,"My Gran bought this for us, and I feel terrible that she wasted her money on it. What a piece of junk. Right out of the box, it missed a lot of stuff on the floor. It certainly isn't meant to replace a proper vacuum cleaner. We merely use it in the kitchen now, and even then, I generally have to pull out our upright vac if I want it totally clean. I cannot believe this thing retails for over forty bucks! Save your $$$ and get a lightweight vac for smaller jobs. It's about as good as a push vac."
Home,5.0,Cordless replaces Upright Vacuum,"I luv, luv, truly luv my Cordless Swivel Sweeper.  I hardly use my Upright anymore.  The Swivel Sweeper is able to get under most of my furniture without having to move anything.  It makes cleaning the stairway soo easy; even keeping the kitchen floor free of crumbs, etc. is better than using the broom and dustpan.  I wouldn't doubt it if my vacuum, broom and dustpan won't be singing to me \\""Can I come back\\""?"
Home,4.0,Happy with product,I am very happy with my swivel sweeper and the price was right. Ordered and received by product in a timely manner.  Thanks.
Home,5.0,Love it!,"It picks up dirt/dust really easy and fast.  Tray is easy to remove to dump dirt out. But the brushes are harder to clean.  Have not experienced any battery or handle problems.  Make sure the battery is removed after each use.  Overall, this is a handy product to have."
Home,1.0,stops after few seconds,i wanted to try for myself so bought it but somewhat disappointed. i feel like i bought it for nothing. the battery was charged as per instruction. the sweeper works well but it is very annoying because it stops every few seconds.  i have to turn it off and on after few minutes to make it work. ended up using the broom anyhow. sweeper ends up in the garage.
Home,4.0,Don't Be So Hard On It,"Ok, I read lots of reviews on this item immediately after purchasing it, to help me decide whether or not to take it out of its package or just return it. As with anything, I found both positive and negative reviews, ultimately deciding I needed to try it for myself. I have decided that there is a very simple bottom line when it comes to this product: it is not a vacuum cleaner nor is it advertised as such. BUT it does what it is meant to do well, and that is effectively picks up dirt, dust bunnies, pet hair and other smaller particles quickly and easily.     Will the Swivel Sweeper replace your vacuum cleaner? No. Will it make your carpets look as good as they do after a thorough vacuuming? No. Will it fluff up carpet pile and suck up hidden dirt and dander? No. But I'll tell you what it will do: it will make your floors, both tile/hardwood and carpet look clean and tidy. It will pick up all that daily junk that accumulates on your floors that you simply don't feel like dragging out the vacuum cleaner for. It will swivel into all kinds of nooks and crannies and underneath shelving, tables and appliances to nab all of those crumbs and dust bunnies that evade your big vacuum. So treat as it is meant to be treated, bearing in mind that it is not a super tricked out vacuum with tons of suction power (it in fact has no suction, simply an electric sweeping mechanism that sweeps the particles into the dust tray) and I don't think you will be as disappointed as some of the reviews I have read.    I have had mine for about 2 weeks. I use it daily and I just had to charge it for the first time two days ago. It is important to follow the directions for charging and DON'T overcharge it as it sounds like that will drain the battery life. I empty the dirt tray after every use as it is very easy to do so and the tray does not hold a lot of material. I have two long-haired pets and while the Sweeper does a fine job of picking up their hair, the hair then proceeds to get tangled inthe rotatating brushes. I find that once every 3 uses or so I need to remove the plastic guard and untangle the hair from the brushes. This is a quick and easy process using my hands or the little gadget they give you for this purpose.    I have been very pleased with the Swivel Sweeper. It has made my life infinitely easier not having to drag out my full-sized upright vacuum every day. It has its limitations but I find that the positives outweigh the negatives. I recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a solution to the daily dirt, dust, and hair that find their way onto your floors (unless of course, you like bonding with your vacuum cleaner on a daily basis :-)"
Home,2.0,You love it - then you hate it!,"I've had two Swivel Sweepers. L-0-V-E-D them both until that fateful day when the charger won't hold a charge anymore after 5 or so minutes of sweeping.  I guess I could buy a new one each time it bonks out but then I'd be waiting again for that fateful day when it won't hold the charge anymore.  I don't think a new charger is available for purchase; could be wrong on that.  But if it was, it'd probably be $15 at least which is half the price of the old sweeper.  Manufacturer should tell you (haha) this product has a limited life.  You love it - then you hate it!"
Home,5.0,Great for a quick pick up,4 large hairy dogs - use this on my kitchen/wooden floor.  2nd one - works great.  First one battery died after a year.  Found it more viable to just buy a new sweeper.
Home,5.0,Great Little Sweeper,This is the 3rd Swivel I bought.<br />I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she is going to be surprised and happy.<br />She cleans my home and she loves using mine.<br />I hope I can wait until Christmas to give it to her!!!<br />I bought one for my Sister for her Birthday. She is handicapped and she has an easy time using the Swivel because it is lightweight.<br /> She loves it.
Home,3.0,One of the better products I've tried lately.,"I just bought this product from QVC for $27.95 plus shipping as it was on a discounted price, but mine doesn't have the bendable handle. I guess they were coming out with the new model and were trying to get rid of the older model.  I have to say I was expecting this product to be a great disappointed but was pleasantly surprised how well it has worked for me.   I've only had it for about 1-1/2 weeks but I'v been using it daily and the charge usually lasts about 3 cleaning sessions which mainly consists of tile and hardwood floors.   I have a central vac and it's a bit of a chore to haul the hose and all the parts into the house from the garage every day, so this handy tool to have around for intermittent cleaning.  It beats trying to sweep up short dog hairs with a broom and dustpan.  You do have to go slowly over the floors a few times to pick up the small hairs and particles but when I clean out the dust pan, there is definitely a lot of dog hair being picked up.  I also liked the design where the dust pan snaps on and off the bottom.  I had bought the Shark sweeper that was much more expensive from Costco and it worked great for 30 days until the spring on the hands-off dust pan became loose and the lid would no longer stay on the dust pan so all the dirt that was swept up would basically droop off the bottom when I released the dust pan.  Luckily, Costco takes returns with no questions asked.  I actually think the swivel has a better design and the battery is easier to manage because you don't have to wait until the charge is completely gone to recharge it like the Shark sweeper.  I just saw the information on the swivel sweeper for 2 for $39.99 and I'm thinking of getting more of these.  they make great gifts."
Home,3.0,Sweeper,"The sweeper is OK, but not great.  It does not pick up hair as well as I thought it would.      Carol"
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper is a handy deal,"if you have a cat(s) who tracks a little of the kitty litter out of its box, this is what you need for picking it up.    if you get small piece of leaves etc. tracked in your house, this is what you need.    it is not a vacuum cleaner, and not made for big jobs.  but when you want to do some quick, light clean up, it is great."
Home,5.0,Fantastic sweeper- bought my 4th one as gift,I am afraid I agree- I just don't get why people have trouble with the Swivel Sweeper- I have 4 of them now with friends over the last 6 months. Everyone loves them- they are not meant to be the end all vacuum but we have animals and they even pick up cat and dog hair easily. It is best to keep it fully charged but it still works after 30 minutes of use. I love it and highly recommend.
Home,5.0,I love my Swivel Sweeper,"[[ASIN:B0007MWZEK Cordless Swivel Sweeper  Original As Seen on TV by Swivel Sweeper]]    I read that someone would give it zero stars. I'm so sorry they've had problems. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I agree with the person who said you have to have realistic expectations. It's not a vacuum cleaner. But for this disabled individual who cannot schlep or manage anything greater than two pounds, this is PERFECT! And it works really well. In fact, it just picked up kitty litter on a battery that was almost dead!    Here's my tale:    About two and a half years ago, I had hideous 35-year-old wall-to-wall shag carpeting torn out, exposing GORGEOUS hardwood floors, which I had sanded and polyurethaned. I immediately purchased a Swivel Sweeper and a microfiber mop. (See Simplee Cleen Microfiber Household Swivel Mop Kit with Two Microfiber Pads) I Swivel Sweep and Swivel Mop about once a week. After I Swivel Sweep, I spritz water mixed with a bit of white vinegar on my floors and mop. I believe the correct proportion is 1/2 cup of vinegar to a gallon of water. But I don't measure. Anyway, my floors are still incredibly beautiful after two and a half years.     And the ONLY reason I recently replaced my Swivel Sweeper is because I accidentally threw out the dust tray. But for $29.59, I got another Swivel Sweeper and I now have spare parts ... including a spare battery.     Otherwise, I believe my original model would still be going strong after over 100 uses!    I see they have a new model. Maybe I'll get that in another two years. But for now, I'm very happy with my product and my floors, which is a good thing. Having floors sanded and polyurethaned is well worth the very messy effort. But I don't want to do it again in my lifetime!    Carol"
Home,2.0,Vaccuum gets 4 Stars... But the Battery? None.,"This product picks up small pieces of dirt and debris on a low pile carpet or bare floor very well. I also like the dirt \\""escape hatch\\"" that releases to have the dirt fall into the trash without having to get my hands dirty. However, 2 months into owning this unit, the battery began failing to charge. Now I have to go out and spend more money on a replacement rechargeable battery."
Home,1.0,Good for a bald person,The first one I purchased lasted almost a year so I thought I would buy a replacement. The second one stopped working after the first use. The gears and shafts get easily bound up with hair and then the motor won't run. Would probably last if there wasn't a trace of hair on the floor but with two daughters and a wife with long hair this is a waste of money. I would recommend it only to a bald person.
Home,2.0,"Good, but doesn't last","I've had mine for about one year, and as of today, I am shopping for a replacement, and it won't be a swivel sweeper.  Pro's, light, fairly effective, fairly easy to clean  Con's, hair clogs the bristles very rapidly, and then it is not effective at all, and deal breaker was ni-cad battery has the \\""memory\\"" issue, and now one year later, the length of a full charge cannot even cover a tiny bathroom."
Home,5.0,Awesome product,"This is a great product. My mother purchased one for herself and liked it so much she bought another for the family cabin.  When I used it there, I too was sold !!  It has excellent pick-up power and the cordless feature is the best. It's an all-around great product and so easy to use, it's actually fun to use !!!"
Home,3.0,"Not Entirely ""As Seen on TV""","I have to admit that I was taken in by the infomercial and figured, \\""what the heck\\"".  I'm still giving it a try, and so far I would say that I am not totally displeased with the product. As long as you lower your expectations a bit and don't expect it to do everything the ad says, you won't be totally disappointed.  First, this sweeper does not work well on carpet.  It works well on tile, linoleum, wood or faux wood.  I really wanted something to sweep the kitchen and bathroom floors.  Having a dog and a teenager, this product does a great job of getting hair, crumbs, dirt, and the like cleaned up quickly and easily emptied.  Swivel Sweeper is much easier to use than a broom and dustpan.  You will need to remove the hair from the brushes often. As stated many times, do not overcharge the battery.  I have followed the directions and it does not hold a charge for very long.  I wait until the battery is completely dead before recharging and remove the battery after every use. The charge lasts long enough for me to clean the areas I want, but little more.  For what I expected, the product is adequate.  If you expect everything \\""AS Seen on TV\\"", you will be very disappointed.  The jury is still out on whether the battery will last very long.  Most reviews here are not very encouraging for battery longevity.  I've had mine a week, so...<br /> I opted to get the original Swivel Sweeper on Amazon as opposed to the new version of Swivel Sweeper that charges $20.00 in addition to the already inflated price, for shipping and handling.  The original was free shipping.  Besides the new nifty handle, I see very little difference."
Home,4.0,Great,I lost my sweeper when I moved and missed having it. I bought this one because I didn't need 2 of the new ones and didn't want to pay shipping. I love having it.
Home,1.0,A Waste of $30!,"I can't believe I wasted $30 of my hard-earned money on this thing! Not only does it not pick up much of anything, but the batteries only lasted a few days. And now I find out that I can't replace them with regular batteries. I have to buy a battery pack for $20 more! I'm throwing this trash in the trash!"
Home,3.0,A Good Sweeper For Your Hard Floors,"The original Swivel Sweeper works extremely well on hard floors. It's light weight and swivel to get around tight crevices. It also does a fairly decent cleaning job right up against the wall on hard floors and even carpets. Although for carpet cleaning in the central area of the room, you're better off using a conventional vacuum cleaner for that. The reason for this, that this sweeper is not a vacuum but a power brush system that would only get the surface dust off the carpet leaving the ground in dust.<br /><br />We bought this sweeper to use on hard floors prior to washing them. For that function it does extremely well, keeping the mop relatively lint free. For use on carpeting, you have to be careful that you don't cause the sweeper to flip and spilling the contents back onto the carpet. Since this kind of sweeper with no suction doesn't clean ground in dirt well on carpeting, I would not recommend it for this purpose.<br /><br />we bought the original Swivel Sweeper as well as the improved Swivel Sweeper G2. When comparing the two, they both clean equally well. The Swivel Sweeper G2 is a little bit more convenient to use because of the refinement such as easier emptying as well as the articulating handle when you need to go underneath furniture. other then the convenient enhancement, both machines cleans equally well. I highly recommend either machine for use around the house on hard floors in place of a broom and dust pan.<br /><br />Final thoughts: For maximum battery longevity,it is best to run the batteries down to a certain degree before recharging. When recharging, be sure to charge more than eight hours but no more than 24 hours maximum. The nickel metal hydride battery pack is consists of six cells. This type of battery shouldn't have any memory effect unlike nickel cadmium ones. My personal feeling is based on past experience that most of these types of products generally use low quality batteries that may not last very long. When the battery wears out, I may consider rebuilding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells.ding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells."
Home,3.0,great for small jobs like hardwoods but not carpet.,"Its not made for heavy clean up, but it's great for getting the pet hair up on hard surfaces not to good on rugs, I would recommend this product for that hurry up job."
Home,5.0,Fast & Light - for quick cleaning,"Very cool product. Very light and easy. This is not for heavy duty cleaning. This is for lazy people, who want to do very less effort and keep more clean in less time. Work great on wood floor and even carpets. Do not forget to clean the brushes once in a while. I love it, my wife too and my kids too :)    Perminder."
Home,1.0,Dead Battery,"The battery is supposed to last 45 minutes fully charged.  The brand new battery only sweeps 10 minutes!  But, the As Seen on TV guys are providing good customer service by sending me another.  I hope it works, for the additional $5 spent on S&H"
Home,1.0,"It worked beautifully, but only for three weeks","I ordered the swivel sweeper at the two-for-one price,\\""just pay extra for shipping the second unit.\\""      However, when I received the units, I found that that company had billed my credit card for over [...] in shipping.  This was more than the cost of the basic units themselves.    I was initially mollified by the fact that the sweeper did work as well as promised.  But when it lost most of its speed within three weeks, and wouldn't work at all after a month,  I concluded that the swivel sweeper was a scam.      I could have returned the unit, but I would have encountered the same exorbitant shipping costs again.    I would say this was a very effective scam.  They didn't mention the shipping cost in the ads, they are accurate that the product works extremely well, they designed it for a short life span, they insulated the company against returns by the high return shipping cost, and they charged very high prices for the extras they wanted to sell during the initial purchase."
Home,5.0,"wow, surprised by the bad reviews!","It never occurred to me to write a review here b/c I purchased this product at a brick and mortar BBB (with a 20% coupon).<br /><br />I friggin LOOOOOOOOVE this thing!  I originally saw the infomercial so I immediately thought it couldn't be that great.  But when I saw it at my local BBB about a year ago, I bought it knowing that I could return it if it was crap.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is NOT my primary vacuum.  Instead, I use it to pick up debris brought in by shoes or our 2 dogs.  We have all tile flooring on the first floor of our home so I figured it'd be handy to pick up things that I didn't want to bring out the Dyson for.<br /><br />Here are the features that I like:<br /><br />*It's super light.  I can easily pick it up and move it around.  It glides easily on tile and on my rugs.<br />*The dirt holding chamber is great b/c you get to see exactly what you picked up!<br />*((this is the part I was really surprised by))  It picks up smaller threads, pet hair, debris from my rugs that my Dyson left behind.  Because I can't use the \\""carpet\\"" feature on my Dyson while vacuuming my rugs (it makes that horrid noise) -- it just glides over some debris and does not pick it up.  But when I use the swivel sweeper on the rug, it completely picks up tons of stuff, including woven in pet hair.  LOVE IT!<br /><br />Now onto the criticisms:<br />*It's very loud.  You don't ever hear the noise on the infomercial.  This doesn't really bother me and it's not loud enough to bother my dogs but my husband commented that they don't tell you how loud it is.<br />*If you accidentally roll it over carpet and it tips over, your sweeped up contents can fall out.  Not a huge deal until you get the hang of it.<br />*minor complaint -- I wish the battery had a low level indicator.  Instead, I just leave it in the swivel sweeper and since I don't use it as my primary vacuum, it's not really a problem.  I don't run out of charge for several weeks or at least a month.  I leave the battery in until it absolutely runs out.  Then I charge for at least 24 hours before using again. This sounds like I put alot of effort into it, but it just sounds like more work than it really is.<br /><br />Overall, I like to use it for a little bits that fall onto the kitchen floor or debris brought in by the dogs.<br />It also worked great during last Christmas to pick up falling tree needles!<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy it for friends and family mostly because it's so light and convenient to use for those little jobs when you don't want to drag out the big vacuum!for at least 24 hours before using again.

Home,5.0,GREATTTT!!!!!!!!!,"Oh my god! I love love love this thing!!! It is so0o0o easy to use! I have a lil toddler who likes to throw food, and this thing picks up everything! Even broken glass, mushy veges, etc. It's easy to charge, no plug ins or whatever, just pop the battery into the outlet, and let charge! I love it!!! Oh my gosh I recommend this to everyone, my home is so much cleaner with this thing because it takes 30 seconds what a broom would take at least, at least 5 minutes. It is a great invension. Just be sure to clean out the hairs and stuff evry so often (i use sissors, which is easier and faster than the tool they gave).  It relieved a lot of stress as well as messes in my home. I love it!!"
Home,2.0,I was disappointed,I expected something a little sturdier than this flimsy light weight product that I doubt will last very long.  However I should have known that from the low price that was asked for the product .  You get what you pay for in this world and it is foolish to expect quality unless you pay enough to expect it.
Home,2.0,Ontel Touchless Swivel Sweeper,"Took mine back tonight!  It worked for little crumbs and that's about it.  My kids drag grass clippings in the house and it just flung them, actually it just flung pretty much everything.  Found myself wanting to throw the thing after a while.

Home,5.0,Love it,"This is the second sweeper I have purchased.  My daughter took the first because she loved it too.  This was recommended to me from someone who also loved it.  The product picks up much better than higher priced similar items such as the Shark, etc.  It is light and great for the sweep up after meals or between the heavy duty weekend cleaning.  I highly recommend this product."
Home,4.0,Pleased,"My three year old daughter loves this book. It was a great tool for teaching colors. Though she is still kinda confused about the purple cat. As always, Love his artwork."
Home,1.0,"Great concept, awful execution","It's easy for me to give this one star after owning the Shark Euro Pro Sweeper for years.  They simply do not compare, except perhaps that the Swivel Sweeper with its flimsy construction is a bit more lightweight.  First, I had to laugh at the reviewer who suggested the Swivel Sweeper should be targeted to bald consumers!  That is so true. I have a lot of hair and I have to clean the swivel sweeper's inside out (think, dusty, dirty) each and every time I want to use it, because my hair is twisted around each rotating element, approximately 8 rotators I have to use a box knife to cut and pull on.  This has virtually eliminated any convenience of the product.  When it does get going it does an Okay job of picking up cat litter, etc, but tends to spit out other things, especially when its tiny collection box becomes on the full side.  I am going to try to return this, but suspect I am out the $.  I would say to anyone considering this to think again and buy the Shark.  My Mom owns the newer Shark sweeper and it has a convenient emptying reservoir that you don't have to touch to empty.  I like my old Euro Pro and have used it for years on the inside and outside of my house. None of these sweepers are really meant for carpeting, but if you have a lot of hardwood/ceramic floors, the Shark is for you.<br /><br />And as for the one star, I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for 3 weeks not and it is broken, makes a horrible sounds and will not rotate even though I have faithfully cleaned out any hair/string that may be clogging it. I suspect it is something in the motor compartment."
Home,5.0,I waited almost 2 years to write this review....,"UPDATE...<br />Well it got slower and slower and it wasn't the battery. Poor Baby ran out of LIFE. So I pulled the second one out of the box and now I have 2 Batteries.<br /><br />So it lasted about 3 or more years and I use it several times a week. It got A LOT OF USE!  It could be it didn't last longer because I always tried putting off the un-cloging the turn brushes for as long as I could - and then longer then I should have I am sure.<br /><br />I really believe I probably contributed to the slowly burning out the motor myself. MY BAD!<br />--------------------------------<br /> I refused to \\""give away\\"" the second one even just because of all the bad reviews this product gets. Now I won't give it away in case this one is ready to \\""GO.\\"" LOL<br /><br />Well folks... been almost 2 years and I swear by this little Sweeper. It won't pick up much sand - especially if you have TILE FLOORS or WOOD FLOORS. It must get SOME SAND, because I ALWAYS find a layer of sand in my Pick Up Tray when I empty it.<br /><br />As for Battery Life and holding a FULL CHARGE. Mine is still at it's Peak. However - I do set a very loud TIMER for 8 hours for the charge. I have NEVER and I mean NEVER over charged it to burn out some of the cells.<br /><br />The pole has never broken. Pole Breaking Complainers are either over zealous pushers or it was a faulty pole.<br /><br />This Sweeper is great for QUICK Touch-ups in between vacuuming. Do not expect it to get everything. Sometimes little white things get caught in the carpet fiber and it will not loosen and come up with the roller brushes. You do have to bend over and pick it free - then the sweeper gets it.<br /><br />Emptying the dust pan is easy. Cleaning the sweeper is not. The Swivel Sweeper comes with a \\""cleaning tool\\"" which is nothing more than a thread cutter/seam ripper (if you know what that is). Hair (human hair) gets wound around all four brushes and needs to be periodically (VERY OFTEN)cut and picked out. What a mess. But I have to do the same occasionally with my vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />The manual says \\""on occasion\\""  - HA! This cleaning needs to be done VERY OFTEN.<br /><br />Pull up a chair, put an old towel in your lap and get ready to spend some time cutting the hair - thread - strings (where threads & strings come from I don't know,) But it will all be there. It will be wound nice an tight and the ROLLERS WILL NOT ROLL when it is clogged. Which is after almost every few uses.<br /><br />It is WELL WORTH IT THOUGH. I love the quick fix that makes my place look TIDY... but I hate cleaning the rollers of the hair & threads.<br /><br />The manual indicates the battery will last 45 minutes on one charge. I believe it. I use my sweeper more than 10 times before it ever needs a charge.<br /><br />I give this Product 5 Stars because it is everything it is supposed to be. I have to clear the rollers on my vacuum, so I do not FAULT THIS PRODUCT at all.<br /><br />Just set that timer and do not overcharge the battery!ual says \\""on occasion\\""  - HA!

Home,5.0,Best Yet!,"This is the best quilling book yet! My quilling experience is limited to only several months and I already owned several other books on the craft/art, but this one has extra lovely projects and ideas.  One person was concerned about the length of paper she uses in her book, but that is of no consequence because you can always cut longer paper into whatever length you want.  Half the fun of quilling is coming up with your own designs.  Copying someone else's designs to the \\""T\\"" doesn't make it your own, in my opinion.  The ideas in the books are what are inspiring. Ms Choi is very talented and I can only hope that my quilling will become as beautiful as hers.  This book is a MUST for any quiller.  You will love it!"
Home,1.0,Bad battery makes it useless,"This is a simple machine and a great product, but it's destroyed by using cheap batteries that have poor performance. I loved the ease of it and that it did so well, but the batteries gave out after less than 3 months. After reading others' reviews, I realize it's a common problem. It's too bad. I would spend a bit more to have decent batteries in it, and others would too. A good product that is destroyed by one component. So does anyone have any recommendations for a cordless electric sweeper? Sorry, electrostatic ones don't work on bare floors."

It picks up everything on the surface but will not pull up dirt out of carpet pile.  I use it in my craft room to pick up bits paper, beads etc. It works great on laminate flooring.

Home,3.0,Return item because Roomba broke down,"I have used two of these that came with my Roomba 500 series for slightly over a year. Both the virtual wall and lighthouse features worked well. I agree that it should plug into AC power. I think C sized batteries would be better than the D cells that it uses.<br /><br />If I were only rating this item alone I would give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, I had to return the item because my 500 series Roomba failed just after the 1-year warranty. I had a 400 series that failed just after warranty due to the \\""circle dance\\"". My 500 series failed because the two main brushes stopped turning with light use and thus it stopped cleaning. From what I have read this was due to a problem of an unsealed gear box with plastic gears. It seems hair would get in and cause the gear box to fail. It seems that the gear box has been re-designed but I do not think that there is any way to know which gear box one is getting when buying the product.<br /><br />I find that iRobot makes a poorly designed product with very poor customer support. I do not see how they are staying in business. I think the only option to use this product would be with a lifetime warranty."

And when you finally get it to pick up the debris, it spits it out later while you are trying to pick up other items.  I have a very thin carpet and hardwood floors and it struggles. It also makes a lot of noise when on the hardwood floors."

Can't believe the power it has, picking up litter from the cat box, hair, general crumbs and dirt. Sometimes I use it twice a day. It is wonderful. Lighweight and does a great job and I don't have to drag around my big, heavy sweeper or use microfibler mops which just pushes the dirt around. Would recommend it for anyone."

I assembled everything without instructions.<br /><br />The unit even comes with a small cleaning tool which attaches to the pole for easy reference ... all sweepers should have this!:)  Would I use the sweeper for carpet?  Not exactly:)  The unit is great for hardwood - not carpet:)  Keep in mind, this sweeper does not SUCK - it SWEEPS!:)  A standard, heavy sweeper using sucking power to pull dirt; this unit sweeps the dirt.<br /><br />The unit is lightweight and EASY to use:)  This unit is not intended to replace your existing sweeper ... it is intended to replace your broom and dust pan:)  If you purchase the unit with this understanding, you will be fully satisfied."
Home,5.0,I absolutely love my Swivel Sweeper,"This may be a little biased as i have not tried any other types of electronic sweepers, but i can tell you, with three kids i am constantly sweeping; after every meal, after every snack and after every craft activity.  This sweeper makes 'day to day' living easy!  The 360 degree swivel action really works well as i don't have to move chairs out from under the kitchen table anymore.  Gets into corners well too!  Love it love it love it!!!  And for my next purchase - i'd love to try the G2 model!"

Needless to say, good things don't last long.  Within 6 months, all three sweepers no longer work.  I could say that maybe I used it too much (once to twice a week) but I know the other two were not heavily used.  I loved the product but the price is too high for the short life."

The retail store has stopped carrying the product (good for them) and the company that makes it requires you to pay shipping costs both ways to fulfill the warranty...essentially repeating the cost of the bad purchase you've already made.  Maybe I recharged the battery too long; realistically, who has patience to monitor recharge times.  If you want something that will last more than four months, don't buy this."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper,"Very little this sweeper will not pick up. A small flat piece of paper it has difficulty with, but other than that, leaves nothling behind."
Home,1.0,Picks up very little...,The Swivel Sweeper I purchased only picks up very small things and often will pick things up and spit them back out. Not worth the money.
Home,5.0,I love it!,"I have had the Swivel for more than a year.  Now the battery is not holding a charge and I am not able to use it, but I have become so addicted to it that I have to get a new one right away.  I think that one year is a pretty decent time for a battery to last, given the price of the Swivel.  It lasted much longer than the 2 months that other people were talking about.  It is perfect for cleaning up crumbs under the table after meals, the junk that people track in from the outside, messes from cooking or crafts with kids, etc.  It is so convenient because it is cordless and the mess is sucked right up so you have no pile of junk to sweep up afterwards.  It can go under almost anything and I love that there are brushes on every side of it, so it can pick up debris in corners of the house easily.  It is a good size that can fit into small places you normally wouldn't get to.  It is gentle on wood floors, never scratching, and it is nice to be able to use it on the mats around my house (in front of the doors, the sink, whatever) when I need a quick clean.  It is so easy and lightweight that my kids, ages 2, 4, and 6, love to use it and that is such a help for me sometimes!  I recommend it!"
Home,5.0,Wonderful light duty sweeper,"I was skeptical that anything this twangy looking would be of any interest to me. But when I used my sister's while visiting over the holidays, I was most impressed cleaning her wooden floors. When I returned home, I ordered this one and have had it long enough to still be mighty impressed with it's amazing ability to get into every conceivable corner and under chairs, tables and base cabinet toe kicks all with one hand. It works well enough on small kitchen carpets, that I don't shake them out anymore before sweeping.  I get somewhere between 3-4 sweepings before recharging and try to keep the battery on the charger for about 6-7 hours. Used the thread cutter cleaning tool to clean the brushes once and it worked OK.  I just laid down laminate in the kitchen and utility rooms and was looking for a way to easily keep them clean. Compared to using a broom and dustpan, this is so easy, that it gets done daily because it's actually fun to use and is much more convenient than getting the vacuum out. The magnet that holds the base to the handle is a great feature, allowing it to be laid against the wall. Only minor irritation is the hole in the handle is too small for my wooden pegs to hang from."
Home,5.0,Love it,I just purchased a new swivel sweeper after my old one that I had owned for two years stopped working. The batttery had ran out.

Its much better than using a broom and dust pan. Its a great product.

On a very low carpet it works well, however the battery (which needs to be charged for 8 hours to get a maximum charge) does not last more than 2 minutes on carpet making it not worth the purchase."

The first \\""electric sweeper\\"" I owned was the Swiffer Vac, and I HATED it! It didn't suck up anything... just moved it around. This product, however, is awesome! The first time I used it, I cleaned my whole kitchen floor and hall (both hardwood), and then ran it over my carpet stairs. I must say, using the sweeper to clean my stairs in about 2 minutes is WAY better than lugging my huge vacuum up the stairs for 30 minutes!! I bought the Sweeper at a local craft store for $20 on sale, and it's the best $20 I ever spent! Can't say I'd spend $40 though... I agree with the previous review that $29 or $19 is a much better price."
Home,1.0,Battery Charge died in 2 minuts,Nothing mush to say...I charged the battery more than 6 hours and tried use the product for 2 minuts... Battery died...
Home,5.0,Great Wine Racks,"We remodeled our wet bar to get rid of the dated (and hard to clean) wall of mirrors and glass shelves. The custom cabinets were supposed to have the typical wine holding wood lattices between them spanning 52\\""...that's a lot of wine! Two of these racks (holding a maximum of 16 bottles) were the perfect solution for us."
Home,1.0,was so excited to try this product,"after seeing the infomercial, i was so excited to try this product. It was great for maybe a day. The battery ran out almost immediately (i read the directions and charged it properly.) I contacted the company by email and told them what happened and never heard back at all. sad. disappointing. :(."
Home,1.0,Handle very cheaply made,"Just want to add to the many complaints, especially those regarding cheap construction.  The item works great, but only on its second use, the handle broke.  No abuse, just shabby construction.  If you examing the handle carefully, you can see very clearly, that the break occurred at a weak point in the handle.  We haven't followed up on the warranty yet, but judging from the reviews, I'm not expecting the outcome to be good.  Will never recommend this product to anyone!!!"
Home,1.0,A Disappointment,"This product is made cheaply, works good for the first couple of times then it peters out. Bought many as gifts for people and they said the same thing. Worked for a bit, then nothing. Waste of money!!"
Home,1.0,Do Not Buy This,Do not buy this product!!!  I could not even complete one flight of stairs without it dying on me about 8 times.  I had to clean it out and untangle it over and over.  If I was not working on my anger I would have thrown it against the wall.
Home,3.0,Good for what it's meant to do,"The other reviewers are right. This product is NOT for carpet cleaning at ALL.   I've used this product for just over a year, and it just died on me a couple of days ago. The battery no longer charges. I was satisfied with it while it lasted. I only use it on our tile floors in the bathroom, to mainly pick up cat litter etc. Im contemplating on getting another one of these for the price as it is easy to store, easy to handle and does pick up the dirt on the tile very accurately.   But I dont believe that it would even roll on carpet? It's obviously not designed for that.   The reason Im giving it 3 stars is, after all this time they should be able to make a more durable product that will not require replacing every year.  I do recommend the product if you want to have a separate cleaning tool for hard surface areas to conveniently pick-up litter, sand, dirt or crumbs etc..."
Home,5.0,Very impressed,"I don't order things off the TV very often.  If you are looking here, I strongly recommend ordering it here or from the SS website, the phone ordering process made me very uncomfortable as it was all automated.  But we got ours together last night, and first used the hand tool.  It was great, it picked up crumbs, cat litter, cat food.  Then we used the sweeper itself.  It is so much quieter than a vacuum and did a very satisfactory job.  When this one gives out, hopefully a long time from now, I would definitely buy another one.  I am even thinking of buying one for the office.  We have janitorial, but we work in a small, high security area, and it's a big hassle to let them in to clean.  Overall, very glad I bought this."
Home,1.0,bearspet,"I agree with the majority of the reviews - the battery life is horrible.  It worked great when the battery was charged, but after a bit the battery would no longer charge no matter how long I kept it plugged in.  I finally trashed the whole thing."
Home,1.0,Died in under 5 minutes!,"I bought the Swivel Sweeper as a gift for my dad. When he tried to use it on the hardwood floor it worked fine. Unfortunately, when he moved it onto the throw rug it died in under 5 minutes. I was very disappointed in this purchase. The company we purchased from, Photoland NY, had fantastic customer service and took the return and refunded the money right away. I do not recommend this vacuum."
Home,5.0,Wonderful clock and toy,Clock is perfect size for a child.  When I received the clock and took off all the protective plastic strips it didn't work.  I put new batteries in it and it suddenly came to life.      This is a great little toy/clock and my Nephew loved it.  The sounds the clock makes sounds just like in the movie.  I only wish the projection of the time onto the wall was on all the time.  :)  Would recommend this to any little Star Wars fan!
Home,1.0,dont waste your money,"This sweeper sounds great in the advertisement, but not worth the money. It does not hold a charge after a month or so. I have bought two of these and they are both the same. Not worth the money. Would not buy again."
Home,5.0,Best thing sonce sliced bread,This product is amazing and well worth the price.  It picks up everything on hard suf=rface floos and most on tightly woven carpet. Vertully ends the need for a broom. The  instructions say do not leave in charged for more than 24 hours.  Make sure you follow thses directions. Otherwise the battery will not least.  I would recommend this sweeper .
Home,3.0,"It's OK, but don't expect it to pick up dust","It's a super little sweeper.  It does just as advertised.  But don't expect it to be anything like a vacuum.  It has no suction.  It only sweeps the particles on the floor into the collection bin, but only particles that can be picked up by spinning brushes.  Dust and powder stay on the floor.  But as I said, as a sweeper it's good.  I especially like that it can get into those hard-to-reach areas."
Home,1.0,not worth the money,"I have two nonworking swivel sweepers in my basement plus a new battery which did not fix the problem -- when I first got this item, I loved it and told everyone how great it was but after using it for about one year, it stopped working,  the 2nd one only worked for three months -- I purchased a new battery but that did not fix the problem -- It just stopped working -- dont know if there is a loose connection in pole or what but for the short time, I used it - not worth the money"
Home,5.0,Warning: does not work with model # 536,"I ordered two 500 Series Virtual Wall Lighthouses through Amazon, and found they do not work with the new model #536.  The Amazon ad states (in the Product Description) that the lighthouses work with models 535 and up.  According to IRobot product support, this was true at one time, but not with the new 536 (and possibly other new models).  The 536 will only work with Virtual Walls.    FYI, I could not rate the lighthouse, so my rating is for the 536."
Home,1.0,Terrible Purchase,"I thought I was getting a good deal, when I ordered the rechargeble swivel sweeper. Unfortunately, the good deal was for the vendor that sold me the sweeper. When I received the sweeper, I tried charging the battery, with no luck. In fact, the charger got so hot, that it almost melted. I discovered that the battery was corroded and would not charge. The return policy of the vendor was so impossible to follow, that I just accepted it as money lost. I don't think the problem was the product, but the vendor selling a broken product, and not having a valid return policy."
Home,4.0,"Great ingenious product, while it lasts...","I've owned a few of these sweepers & can not live without them. They work very well & are a great alternative to vacuuming. They are not meant to replace vacuuming but if you live in a house with kids that get cereal all over the floor, or you need to sweep a high traffic area there is nothing better than these sweepers, period.    THE GOOD:   They charge quickly and are always ready to use. The unit is so lightweight it glides fast over large areas & I believe picks up & cleans a big area faster than a vacuum could do considering the heavier weight & slow moving with the vacuum.  you can expect the sweeper to pick up 95% of dirt & small particles. Anything small gets swept into the chamber but if the object is larger (like a marble or pen cap) it may not fit or may clog the brush area. This is easy remedied by removing the clogged item by hand, or just avoid any object bigger than a marble. Super small stuff like dust & fine dirt may not get picked because this is a  sweeper, not a vacuum. But you're still going to vacuum once in awhile, right?   The sweeper works on all flat floors & low pile carpet (but it does the best job on hardwood & tile floors or a non-carpeted surface)  This product will pick up all the VISIBLE stuff on the floor so its great fora fast clean up or when you have company coming over & you don't have time to vacuum. These work ten times better than a broom regarding speed & easy of use. They also don't create dust clouds while sweeping so if you're an allergy sufferer this is better than using a traditional broom.  When new, these units also hold a very long charge & can sweep endlessly, I can't imagine not being able to finish a sweeping job when the unit is fully charged. As the unit ages though expect the charge to dissipate as all rechargeable batteries eventually wear out. I saw another review that said the manual warns against over-charging which can kill the battery over time, so perhaps take the battery off the charger after 24 hoursso it doesn't get over-charged.    THE BAD:  these units are a bit flimsy so you can't expect them to last like $200 vacuum. If you aren't careful the pole will bend or crack, & little plastic pieces can break in the sweeper. I had part of the top tray come loose on my last sweeper but it was easily fixed with a piece of clear tape (or duct tape). All the negative reviews about these breaking make me wonder, do people realize this is a $20 item? I've about to purchase my third unit, but I don't mind because we've gotten about 2 years out of each one. Again for $20 even if I had to replace one every 6 months I'd still do it because there is nothing on the market at this price that does as good as a job. We literally use this every day on our floors & could not live without it.   The unit does have a tendency to collect hair around the brush. I've found this does not affect the sweeper operation unless you really let it get bad & never clean it. Otherwise the brush is cleanable by hand & pulling out the hair & debris or by using a scissor or brush-cleaning tool to remove caught material.  Over time the tiny feet that make this unit glide over your floor will wear down & become thinner. When this happens the sweeper will not work as well because the brush will be too close to the floor & make the motor run slower. However it takes a long time to wear out the feet, probably a year or two with daily use so this is not a big deal. But note that if you wore the feet out you probably got more than your money's worth.  The dust tray release is a little flimsy but operational.  you sometimes have to sweep over an area a few times to get all the items you are trying to sweep up, remember this is not a vacuum so there is no suction. Considering that it works surprisingly well & get most everything with the first pass.    SUMMARY:  Great unit, no serious complaints. I think this product is better than the average reviews it is getting, simply because I don't think you can ding aproduct because it doesn't last forever. Performance-wise its exceptional at sweeping, 5 stars. This will do much better than a small cheap hand-vacuum or stick vacuum because I've tried many of them. Of course its not going to do as well as a full upright vacuum. For its design & price it is exceptional. When this unit first came out it was $39 on sale. Now its half that price new. If you buy this unit be realistic, its not a $200 vacuum. You may have to replace it in 6 months or a year but at $20 for something you use daily, I think this is still a good investment (I get about two years out of mine before they die). There are very few items you can buy for $20 that are going to last forever. This is the best alternative to daily vacuuming especially for hardwood & tile floors and nothing is faster for a quick clean up. Can't see how you would not like this product."
Home,1.0,Disappointed,"I followed directions and charged the battery 8 hours, put it in the sweeper, and it worked great! For all of 10 minutes. Then it revved its motor, stopped, and has not worked again. We have tried charging the battery again, checked to make sure everything is where it's supposed to be, but all for nothing. The machine does not work. That was an expensive 10 minute sweeping job."

But that is also the only time it Projects the time on the ceiling/wall, other than when the alarm is going off.      I would have thought that a PROJECTOR CLOCK would project the time ALL the time.  That would not be to much of a problem except the that only other way to read the time in on a tiny little screen, which does not light up so it can not be read at night.  And if you press the DEMO button in the middle of the night you get a lot of R2-D2 noise, that wakes up Mommy ;("

Home,5.0,"Love this product, use it every day!","First of all, it's NOT a vacuum. Good grief, you shouldn't plan on this replacing a vacuum either. It's a sweeper and that's it.  I love it for my hardwood floors. It picks up better than any other sweepers I've had. Yes, I've gone through a battery on it, but only one battery in about 4  years.  It charges fine. It works fine. And, I habitually left in the charger for over 24 hrs a time because I'd just forget about it.  I KNOW that is not good for the battery life and is bound to wear down my battery at some point.  Sounds like there have definitely been a few duds in the batches of these products, but I can't say enough about it. Mine has worked GREAT!  I recommend it all the time!"
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,I am in my 70s and  have arthritis.  One day I was hauling my vacuum out of the closet and decided then and there not to do it again.  It was just too heavy. Since I have no carpet at all I decided to try this marvelous contraption.  I love it!   My hubby has a shop vac which I can use for  upholstered furniture so I haven't missed having my canister  vac..I haven't tried the  sweeper on carpeted areas  but for my hard surface floors it works great. I gave my vacuum to my son  and he's happy with it.   I haven't yet given away my broom and dust pan but I  don't use them much any more.  Wonderful product highly recommended by a 74 year old gramma!
Home,5.0,"Not exactly as pictured, but great.","1. Very accurate to the latest Start Trek movie.<br />2. Not as thick as you would think (while the picture above does not show a side profile, it looks thick)<br />3. Real metal. A good thing in this world-o-plastic.<br />4. The writing and badge design on the box pictured above is photo-manipulated (\\""photoshopped\\"") as the writing on the box you get is barely visible.<br />5. The background behind the badge in the box that you get is brown, not yellow/gold as seen above.<br />6. It has two pins to hold it securely and upright to whatever garment you attach it.<br />7. The badge is heavy. You may want to find a way to anchor the back of the garment you use or ensure you are using a thick enough fabric to prevent sag.<br />8. Brushed finish is nice. These are still obviously mass produced, so a little cleaning up via better brushing and removing some flash may be necessary to make it picture/conference perfect.<br />9. Will try to remember to post detailed pictures once my new HTC Evo 4g arrives.<br /><br />Overall great product. Looking forward to obtaining the rest of the badges. Someone want to gift them to me? They are on my wishlist... (hint, hint) :]"
Home,4.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,I really enjoy this product.  It is light weight; goes from tile to carpet without having to change from one position to another; it holds it's charge well; it goes around chair legs and under tables easily; it picks up most anything I've ever had on the floor.    It was easy to assemble also.
Home,5.0,Star Trek Command badge,"Son and I are very pleased with this item.  As noted in other reviews, it is metal, no plastic.  It has a nice weight, solid but not enough to sag on clothing.  Two tack-style pins with squeeze caps keep pin from swiveling on clothing.<br /><br />The retail package is attractive, not exceptional.  The front window panel lifts, almost jewel-box fashion.  It isn't a jewel or display box, but relatively light cardboard.  Didn't feel flimsy and ours did have a color background behind the pin.<br /><br />That said, it is cool and fun, and we are glad to have it!  We also ordered the Star Trek Science badge, so I'll copy this review to that page, as that one is equally nice, ours was from a different seller.<br /><br />(While not a part of this 'product' star rating, I'll note that it arrived promptly, was appropriately packaged, and was in brand-new condition)"
Home,5.0,Well made item,This a really well made costume piece that I am sure I will enjoy for years to come. It is a little smaller than they appear on television though.
Home,1.0,Wish I could give --5 star rating. PURE GARBAGE!!!,"I really think that 9 outa 10 of the stuff sold for $19.95 etc. on TV is crap!!! The wife bought this piece of junk and did exactly as the instruction said. 7 minutes into trying it on the wood floor it died. tried the other battery, worked 30 seconds then died. The batteries would not charge either. Sent the unit back and they did send another which did exactly the same thing.<br /><br />But this time the second battery would not charge at all and the charger started smoking in the wall. With shipping return cost and original cost of crap sweeper I'm out $53. If you’re thinking about purchasing this junk, just burn your money or flush it down the toilet, it's the same results you'll get if you buy this."

I replaced the batteries with fresh ones, and after considerable tinkering and bad language, got it to display the time.  Nothing else.  Fortunately I read some German, since the only English is on the outside of the box. Nothing resembling English in the instructions.  Poorly made, and a great disappointment.  Worth about $5.00 if it worked.  The only good part of the experience was Amazon's return policy:  It went back that same day."

I talked to them on the phone and had my credit card company try to fix things, but after 6 months, it still has not been taken care of.  BE CAREFUL when using a credit card with this company.  I think they make their money by overbilling and never resolving things. This product is certainly not worth the hassle!!!"
Home,1.0,Great if it works!,I purchased this product after seeing a friend use it.  One sweeper worked fine the other did not. I purchased extra batteries and a smart charger.  It didn't help.  I then had to purchase a new pole. The problem was the original unit - it was not anything I did.  The pole should have been free.  There is no guarantee that the problem will be solved.
Home,5.0,Nice touch to a trekkie costume!,"I purchased this for a halloween costume and like all the other reviews, it's awesome.  Granted it's just a piece of metal, but it's good quality.  If you're wearing this on a costume or light weight shirt, take a hint from a military guy and find some cardboard, stick this to the cardboard.  Cut out a backing around it, then when you wear it place the cardboard between the shirt and frogs (pin holders).  This keeps the pin from sagging on your shirt."
Home,2.0,"For new 500 series models, only works with 570 and above","I recently bought a 560 from Bed Bath and Beyond, and purchased these light houses on Ebay. The seller claimed, just like on here, that the light houses work with the 535 and above models.  Unfortunately, that is not the case now.  IT USE TO.  Now the 500 series they have coming off the line no longer support the light houses, unless you purchase the 570 or above models.  So my 560 will not work with these. :(  And I cannot return the light houses either.  Wish I had purchased the items from Amazon instead; they are so great with returns.  I'm sure the product would have worked great......instead I have a Roomba that is just all over my lower floor."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper rocks,"great product for hard wood or tile floors, goes anywhere, \\""sweeps\\"" anywhere thanks to spinning brushes on all 4 sides and a swivel head that lets you maneuver it at will; no more dragging out the big ol' upright only to blow the stuff around, or the swiffer to miss anything larger than a dust bunny.

Home,5.0,Does the job,"I purchased the swivel sweeper to use on my kitched/diging area tile floors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- long battery life. I think I only have to charge it once every week to 10 days. When the battery gets low, it's doesnt swep as well, but it still works.<br />-- swivel action. Works extremely well around our dining room chairs and registers. The head even fits behind the toilet and in between the wall and floor registers.<br />-- price. I picked this up for under 20 bucks. Unless you are a super cost-conscious shopper I don't think you can find any fault in spending this for what you get.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  handle is a bit undersized for the head. I can picture it getting loose and wobbly down the road but thus far, I've had no problems.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone not wanting to break out the broom and dustpan each time there is a little mess to clean. This obviously wasn't designed to clean an entire house like a vacuum is. For the money, I'd say the return on investment is excellent!"

Home,3.0,"Better than a broom, but not by much","This is an interesting product in that I can't quite make out why people go crazy over it. Sure it eliminates having to mess with a dust pan if you use a broom, but you still have to bend over to release and reinstall the very small built in dust tray.    It does pick up link and large particles, but not as effectively as a broom does, especially if you are not in a rush with the broom.     This is our second unit and although its convenient (which is its only real, useful, benefit, the battery life is poor (this is our second unit    I'm away that he new G2 model has a much improved battery, but the price is triple what you can get the original sweeper for, and ten times higher than a broom.    The motor is very weak (I've experienced this one two brand new units) and if anyone has long hair in the household, it will wrap around the brushes and really lower battery life to barely a few minutes between charges (barely enough to get the kitchen floor done)    Considering that it does not pick up everything off the floor, you can only use it on smooth floors (on rugs and carpets, the motor slows down so much that it reduces battery life to about one minute), and you have to clean out the dust tray every time you use it because it fills too quickly, its barely worth $20 that its available for at the time of this writing, but its convenient for a quick pickup of lint if you plan on emptying the dust pan at a later time."

My mom sent it to me as a gift....and boy was it one of my favorite gifts so far. My WHOLE house is hardwood or tile and let me tell you, it cleans up floors as fast as it takes you to scale the house. I use it daily and I know it works well because I can see it working and walk around barefoot after without any annoying clingers on the bottom of my feet. I like to use it on bathroom rugs too, but that seems to slow down the motor so you have to lift it up above the carpet a little. The battery works well. I can do the whole house without it dying. Its great! I haven't used a broom or dustpan since!!! :) Well....there was the time the hubby broke a light bulb...but you know what I'm saying. ;)"
Home,2.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"I purchased a Cordless Swivel Sweeper about 2 years ago. At first, I liked it, because it's light and easy to operate if you have to clean small areas  - like kitchen, every day (it's not good for thorough cleaning). It picked every little dust or crumbs that fall from the table and very easy to clean it - just empty the container in the garbage bin or a bag- so I liked it. After a while I noticed, though I charged the battery, it would only work for a short time and then suddenly stop! Then, it started happenning all the time, it'd work for 10 seconds and then shut off for no reason. I contacted with the manufacturer and they told me that I need to replace the battery, also gave a tip that when I don't use the Sweeper I have to take the battery out, and never to leave battery in the charger once it's charged, and never to recharge until the battery completely runs out of energy. Now I don't know if it's worth buying another battery or not. In total, I used my Swivel Sweeper normally only for a few months out of 2 years that I have it. I might try and get another battery, but I'm worried it won't last long either."

Home,5.0,Really cool,"Really cool.... just awesome. I'm not a big Star Trek fan but my step dad is. The quality was really good, it pins on so it won't come off. I bought the whole set for him for xmas and he really like them. They are about 2.5 inches from top to bottom and they weren't too heavy or anything."
Home,3.0,DOES THIS WORK??????,"I HAVE A BAD BACK.  IT'S HARD FOR ME SOME DAYS TO BE RUNNING AROUND WITH A VACUMM.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS.  IT SAYS IT WILL RUN ON A FULL CHARGE FOR UP TO 45 MIN.  I HAVE YET TO FIND THIS TRUE AT ALL,  MINE RUNS FOR ABOUT 5 MIN.  MAYBE IT'S NOT CHARGING ENOUGH?  I CHARGED IT AS STATED FOR 8 HOURS.  THEY WARN YOU NOT TO CHARGE THE BATTERIES FOR MORE THEN 24 HOURS OTERWISE YOU WILL LOSE CHARGING ABILITY.  I FIND THIS NOT LONG ENOUGH.  I HAVE OTHER LITHUIM BATTERIES,  AND THEY ARE ON CHARGE ALL THE TIME,  I HAVE YET TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THEM HOLDING A CHARGE.  AND SOME OF THESE ARE OVER 5 YEARS OLD.  I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT'S A SPECIAL LITHUIM BATTERY.                                                                         ANYWAY AS ONE GUY STATED HIS HANDLE BROKE ON HIM,  YA I CAN SEE IT,  IT'S NOT VERY RUGGED,  BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRISSLES ON IT THEY SEEM REAL SOFT,  SO PUTTING TO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE HANDLE WON'T PICK UP ANYTHING ANY BETTER,  I CAN SEE IT BRAKING.  ANOTHER FLAW IN THIS ITEM IS THAT THEIR IS VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR THE ITEMS YOU PICK UP.  THE TRAY FILLS UP REAL FAST,  WHEN YOU HAVE ANIMALS YOU HAVE TO EMPTY IT SEVERAL TIMES IF DONE ONCE A DAY.                                                                             ALL IN ALL IT'S EASY TO CLEAN IT'S LIGHT,  AND YES IT PICKS UP DOG AND CAT HAIR AND DOG FOOD.  I DO LIKE THE WAY THE BRUSHES WORK BECAUSE THEY WILL GRAB EVERY LITE ITEM ON THE FLOOR.  LOVE THE LIGHT ALSO,  I CAN SEE WHAT I AM CLEANING.  I THINK IF THEY TOUGHEN THIS UP SOME,  IT WOULD BE A LOT NICER."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,I love the Swivel Sweeper.  It is so easy to use and does a very good job of picking up.
Home,3.0,Good pickup - Swivel Customer Service is HORRIBLE,"Amazon cusotmer service is great, but Swivel Sweeeper Company service is the pits!  I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for about a year and use it almost daily.  The pickup is great, even picks up tons of pet hair and small crumbs.  Works great on low pile carpet, tile and hardwoods.  I don't think it picks up heavy stuff like coins.  You do have to clean the brushes often with the little tool provided, especially if you get a lot of long hair on your floors, but it's not a big deal.  I have not been dissappointed with the battery as some others have mentioned.  Of course it would be nice if the charge lasts longer, but I do think the 45 minutes of cleaning time is about accurate.  I only use it for 5-10 minutes at a time, so I don't have to constantly charge it.  After about 6+ months of good use, the tip of the rubber handle broke which does not affect performance or use.  But at that sametime the sliders started to fall off, which makes it useless because without the sliders it will scratch your floors and won't slide around smoothly.  I went to the website, found my exact model and ordered the replacement sliders.  It took weeks to get them, and turned out they sent the wrong ones, they didn't fit/were a totally different shape.  I called customer service and ended up on the phone with them for 37 minutes, speaking to 3 different people about the problem.  They all insisted they have to be the correct ones, even though the shape and size did not match up at all.  They were not helpful at all and seemed almost ignorant and bordering on rude.  In the end, they agreed to send me a different set, but they doubt it will be the correct ones, and it will take 4-8 weeks!  A few days later I noticed my Mom had a Swivel Sweeper at her house, but it was an older/discontinued model she bought from a discount store for cheap and her sweeper had the same sliders the company sent me as replacements.  Needless to say, I'm annoyed.  I can't be without my sweeper for another 4-8 weeks, so I'll have to go buy a brand new one.  Wish I did that from the beginning.  I thought about buying the Shark, but I really like the sliding feature, which I don't think any other sweeper has.  So this is a uinque product that I am willing to buy again, even though their"

Home,3.0,"Beautiful Work, But Measurements Seem Off...","This book is full of amazing quilling.  True works of art that show that the author is amazingly talented.  However, upon selecting a project to start, I noticed that the length of the quilling strips used are 10 5/8 inch (27 cm) long.  It's difficult to find quilling supplies let alone strips that are pre-measured to that length.  This meant cutting down strips to 10 5/8 inch long.  The author then has us divide the strips into 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 lengths claiming that \\""this method is easy to pick out the desired strip length without having to use a ruler\\"".  This may be true, but involves several hours beforehand of using a ruler to not only cut my strips to 10 5/8 inch, but also down into further lengths.  This really complicates things and seems unnecessarily time consuming, even for quillers who have gobs of patience.  After cutting strips down, I started to put together the designs and some lengths still didn't seem right.  One pattern in particular was quite a bit larger than the photo.      Maybe for a more experienced quiller this book would be good, but as of tonight, I'm thinking it might make a beautiful addition to my coffee table."
Home,3.0,swivel sweeper,"I use this several times every day and love that it is much easier than a regular broom.  It works very well on all types of surfaces and with many types of \\""dirt\\"".  I would recommend this product, but it does not keep a charge as long as I was hoping.  It seems to wear down quickly on carpeted surfaces and area rugs.  Overall it is still much better than dragging out the regular vacuum as often as I need to sweep."
Home,5.0,Awesome!,We have been wanting to get a wine rack for a long time but could never find one that we liked. We hung this in our kitchen and it looks great! I also like that it gets the wine bottles out of the way. This wine rack is very modern and looks very stylish on the wall.

Home,1.0,A Cheap Imitation,"This swivel sweeper was advertised \\""As Seen on TV\\"". It is a very shoddy imitation. It is very noisy compared to the real one. It doesn't empty like the real one. AND it is not as sturdy as the one I had purchased two years ago. I used it once and threw it away. I should have saved the packaging and returned it, but I had already disposed of the packaging by the time I had charged the battery. It also took the seller about 12 days to get it in the mail according to the post mark. I live in HI so it was a long time coming. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this seller and his product."
Home,5.0,love the swivel sweeper,"Love the swivel sweeper. Picks up crumbs quickly and easily. Have found it is best to pick up long threads from floors before using as they wind themselves around brushes and you will need to remove periodically, but overall, is the handiest and easiest sweeper I have owned."
Home,5.0,Works Great,"The sweeper came in bubble wrap and looked like it had been drop kicked over Niagara Falls, but when I extricated it out of its mangled packaging and put it together, everything worked as advertised.  I made sure the battery was charged of 8 (but not more than 12) hours and started sweeping.  Have had it for a week and it is still on it's first charge.  It is not for heavy cleaning, but excellent for light pick up--and I love the easy to use emptying tray feature which allows you to dump debris directly into the trash can without removing the dustbin.  Exactly what I was hoping for when I made the purchase."

Admittedly, I was a little disappointed when I first read it as it didn't seem to have the same magic as the other Carle books.  Evidently, my daughter disagrees!  What is so great about the book is that it can appeal on many levels. At first, she began to notice and point out clouds to us.  Now she focuses on the imaginative aspect of the book - she sees shapes in clouds, pieces of cheese, etc.  We have several Eric Carle books, and it seems to be a perennial favorite."
Home,2.0,not too good!,works pretty well on hardwood or tile but not on carpet.  Had to go over the same spot several times and then sometimes it still wouldn't sweep it up.  Would not recommend.
Home,5.0,Works great and does just what I need it to do.,"My mom bought this for me a few years ago (maybe 5) she's a big infomercial person so my xmas gifts are usually things like this...and the bullet and tap lights, etc.  This one I acutally use and really love! We have tile floors, a huge dog and a toddler. I use it every night to sweep up the floors after dinner and I use it on the tile before I steam clean them (using my Enviro-steamer which is awesome). It acutally has a really strong suction, sucks up cereal, dog hair, food the baby drops, and just about anything I roll over.  I have a really good vacuum but on the tile, this works much better.  I do not use this on carpet so I'm not sure how it would work on that. I love the swivel handle and it's really easy to empty. Last night we had cornbread at dinner which my toddler crumbled and blanketed all over the floor. The swivel sweeper picked it all up and is so easy to use. Maybe I'm just lazy and don't want to use a broom and dustpan...but I really think this works better. Mine is getting pretty old and beat up and it's just made of plastic so it's not the most sturdy appliance.  One of the gray clips on the top has broken off. It still works fine but dust can come out of the hole on top where the clip was so I came to amazon to look at purchasing a new one. Even though it's got a piece broken off, I'm still giving it 5 stars because it does everything I need it to do, and for a cheaper infomercial product,it's lasted 5 years which is pretty good."
Home,1.0,Don't buy this product,"I bought this product from TV show a couple of years ago and I was very happy with it at that time.  That is why I bought Swivel Sweeper again through Amazon. This time, it totaly disappointed me. First, the charger is not working at all. I have to use my old charger to charge the battery!!! Second, the battery only can last 5 minutes, even though it was charged 8 hours!!! Third, when I use it, the cover shakes badly!!!     I don't know why Swivel Sweeper product's quality goes down so giant. It really waste my money."
Home,1.0,Zero stars!,I was really hopeful this product would work so I ignored the bad reviews and bought it.  I was a fool.  Everyone is absolutely right the battery only lasts 5 minutes despite following the charging instructions to the T.  I am returning this product and will spend my money on a better brand.  I am very disappointed!
Home,5.0,"Great item, gets good compliments.","This thing is really a great idea, and as others have said, is practically an art piece.  Well made with a clever mounting design.  I mounted to a stud and would not recommend doing otherwise.    You do have to create the mounting holes exactly, so this is not something you can just slap up on the wall!"

Home,5.0,"Expensive, but well worth it.","Because a typical incandescent bulb uses about 95% of it's energy consumption as heat, and not light, these LED bulbs are great bargains, even at their current high cost. The light from this bulb is diffused and pleasant, and adequate for it's purpose in my home. It should last at least 10 years and use about 10% of the energy that a regular incandescent bulb uses.<br /><br />I'm planning to replace at least one incandescent bulb a month with an LED bulb for longetivity and energy savings. I hope I can do it. The CFLs are fine, but contain serious toxins and are not as energy efficient as these LED bulbs, so I'm not planning on using any more of them.<br /><br />I really hope the cost of the LED bulbs drops as production increases!"

Home,1.0,HORRIBLE!,"Awful product. It does NOT work on carpet, it won't pick up the dust between tiles, and if you have linoleum floors it's fine as long as you only plan to use it for about 3 minutes.     Now, you can return in it if you'd like to make several phone calls and spend even MORE money on batteries and shipping. It seems a good old fashioned broom is still superior to this crap."
Home,5.0,Star Trek Command Division Badge,"When I first saw this I just had to have it. I'm not a hardcore fan of Star Trek, more like a casual fan, but this badge is just amazing. It looks to be an exact replica from the 2009 film, having found out that they were actually pins worn on the uniform shirts instead of a pattern attached to them like the original series uniforms.     Its made of Metal and it did require some polishing in the area surrounding the command symbol but aside from that  it is a beautiful piece and a great collectors item for any fan of Star Trek. I ordered one on a Friday night, and it arrived the following Wednesday, about a day or two ahead of Amazon's estimated delivery date.    I was so pleased with this item I went and ordered the Medical Badge for a friend the same day I got this and that arrived two days later on  a Friday, also earlier than Amazon's estimate. I definitely plan to purchase the Engineering and Science Badges in the near future, as well as a second set of Medical and Command, the former for myself and the latter for my Brother."
Home,5.0,Good for the money,I bought this product on sale at a local retailer for $10. This thing does a good job and I don't have to fiddle with a dust pan.  It is not a vacuum cleaner by any stretch of the imagination but it picks up dust and even buffs my laminate hardwood floors a bit.  I'm satisfied.
Home,5.0,Fun way to keep things looking clean.,"This is a fun way to keep floor surfaces looking clean.  We all know we should get out the big vacuum cleaner and do the thorough job frequently.  But, we all also know we don't do it as often as we should.  This keeps things up to par for the quick job that will make things presentable.  I love it."

Home,1.0,Battery Problems,"Having all hardwoods and and a large family, we use our Swivel at least twice a day, and gladly repurchase this product every 1-2 years.  First off, the Swivel is the best sweeper out there for hardwoods.  Most particles drift to the baseboard so having the 4 corner brushes is invaluable.  We've used $100 plus cordless sweepers with vacuum suction and they still don't hold a candle to the Swivel.  Also, other sweepers don't flatten out for under furniture (where most dirt collects) as perfectly as this product.    In order to save some money we purchased through Amazon via Capital Outlet.  Product arrived brand new, but battery died in 1/8 of the time of previous experiences.  We can usually do the entire downstair (1200 sq ft) twice before needing a charge, and this didn't last a quarter of the floor.  Subsequent full charges (not exceeding 24 hours) with full discharges did not improve battery life.  Like I said, we've used Swivels for years and are familiar with use.  We returned product and purchased through an expensive retail outlet chain.    Seems experiences here at Amazon are mixed, so for the price it might be worth the gamble as Amazon accepted our return without hassle."

Home,1.0,Disappointing as a historical account AND as a quilt pattern,"If you're interested in this book for the history, you're likely to be disappointed by the historical inaccuracies. The letters are reportedly from 1922 but instead of using reproduction fabrics of the era, the author used Civil War reproduction fabrics for the blocks that illustrate the book. The quilt block patterns weren't necessarily available in the early 1920s either. For example, the Century of Progress block used in this book wasn't published until 1933 - more than a decade after the letters were written. Instead of this book, consider something by Barbara Brackman - a noted quilt historian. Ms. Brackman is very likely to have her facts straight!    If, like me, you thought this book would be a good way to learn about using traditional piecing techniques, save your money. The book offers no tips or instructions for using the templates and diagrams. (If you order the Kindle edition, you won't even GET the templates!) There's a Yahoo! mailing list but heaven help the quilter who asks THAT group for help. In the few weeks I've been a member, I've seen responses ranging from \\""Take a class!\\"" to \\""Buy the companion software if you want instructions.\\"" I'm no longer a beginner and wasn't looking for a beginning-level project but a few pages of general instructions about the author's chosen construction technique or suggestions for organizing the 106 templates required would have been useful. The back cover says \\""everything you need\\"" so I expected the book to be reasonably complete.    I've made over 100 blocks from Sylvia's Bridal Sampler by Jennifer Chiaverini. In my experience, it's a much better project for learning about traditional techniques. Chiaverini includes instructions to make blocks using several different methods: rotary cutting, templates, paper-piecing, and applique. Blocks range from the simple 9-patch to the complicated Mrs. Cleveland's Choice with 65 pieces. I've learned a lot from working on that project and have enjoyed the Yahoo! mailing list community that focuses on Chiaverini's books and patterns.    I think I'll donate my Farmer's Wife Sampler to a library. The historical inaccuracies, coupled with the shortcomings of the templates and piecing diagrams, have led me to conclude it's not worth the space it takes on my bookshelf. I will not look at any future publications by this author."

I gave my neighbors the one that works and they ended up giving it back to me since mine didn't.  They said it doesn't do anything anyway.  It's true.  It does nothing but make noise, it doesn't pick anything up.  Some people say it's basically an electric dust pan.  Perhaps I'll try using it on that.  I was hoping for something that would make vacuuming up the steps easier.  Nope!  70 bucks down the drain.  I never return anything, but I will write a review so no one makes the same mistake.

Home,2.0,poor choice,"It is very difficult to insert the long pieces of the handle together.   Also, I charged the battery for a full 24 hours to start and it worked for 15 minutes before needing a recharge. I would have been better off to purchase a light vacuum cleaner than this noisy broom."
Home,4.0,It's OK. Price Was Right,"I bought the cordless Swivel Sweeper after seeing a great buy in a local retail flyer and reading reviews on Amazon.Com. The first day I used the sweeper I loved it. It is a little noisy but not terrible. The second day I used it I was not as impressed. I am not sure if the battery was completely charged even though I charged it overnight. The instructions say to charge it AT LEAST 8 HRS. I Charged it over 12. Maybe I over charged it? Who knows.    Like I said, I bought the sweeper because the price was right and because in our apartment we have laminate flooring and area rugs, so I do not need a regular vacuum. Most of the dirt is swept up with a broom and dust pan. For those reasons, the sweeper works great for me. Also, I noticed it works better on my area rug than my laminate flooring.     I read tons of reviews before purchasing the Swivel Sweeper. My advice us to try it for yourself. You can always return it if you don't like it."

It was not being handled roughtly at all and just snapped.  The plastic in the middle apparently is just a bad design and broke just like my friend read about.    I call Ontel (makers), they said if it is with in 90 days I can pay to ship it back and pay $12 to have it fixed.  Or I can pay $9 to have a new pool sent to me.    What a crock of crap!  Why pay more money to have it fixed or buy a new pole when it is just going to snap again!  Ontel has a bad product and they are just going to ignore it.    It is a shame because I really do love this thing.     I would say do not buy this unless you are handy and can fix the handle when it breaks."

What is going to happen in the future when I want to do a project and the patterns are not available? I would have NEVER purchased this book-- if I knew the patterns were not included in the book."
Home,2.0,Needs more help for the holidays,"This craft book has 255 projects to make for various holidays throughout the year.  Many of the `crafts' involve ideas such as putting cellophane and candy in clear plastic balls and placing them in a large glass bowl, or putting dollies on top of wrapped packages for  decoration.<br />There are some good ideas; for example how to cover a balloon with glitter, making the popular love knot bracelets (although the bracelets shown are not the thick ones many prefer), felt fortune cookies and many egg dying tips. Sometimes the directions, quite frankly, are awful - almost no directions at all, for instance on how to make a birch basket. One project says use wheat paste, but neglects to tell how to make it or if you should purchase it.  Another tells you to download and print spider web templates-where? - There is no recommendation within the project directions itself.<br />Silhouette templates for windows that appear to be 3-4 feet high are less than ½ inch large? This book just does not lend much of a helping hand most of the time. An illuminated trick or treat bag, which is a fabulous idea, gives no illustration at all with the very short directions on how to accomplish this task. The so called templates for all the crafts are at most 1\\"" high.<br /><br />The holidays covered are; New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's day, Father's day, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas. There is an index and a section on basic techniques - cutting with a craft knife, using a pom-pom maker, embroidery stiches, etc. A source guide with phone numbers, web sites and some addresses and a buyer's guide are also included.<br /><br />If you are a beginning crafter, you really need more help than this book will give you. Even experienced crafters might rub their head and eyes in exasperation."
Home,5.0,"Wow, it's a must have!","I love this book.  It's a perfect gift to give a new mom.  I was fortunate to be able to hear the author read this book several years ago in Canada.  There were hundreds of us in the audience.  We were all in tears. It's beautifully written.  Not a lot of words, but he nails it with the words he uses.  Buy it, you'll be glad."
Home,3.0,It's alright,"This book has 225 handmade projects for all holidays all year round.  A few of the projects and ideas are quilled greeting cards, glitter balloons, table setting ideas, harvest centerpieces, etc. Some of the projects are really nice and the ideas are good to have to.    The instructions seem alright to me, but not everyone may agree .  You can find a few of these projects on her website.  One thing you should know before you buy the book is that you have to get the patterns off her website.  You are only given thumbnails of each clipart or template in the book. So if you don't have internet access, what will you do?  Copy of book was from Publisher."
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts New book 2011,"This is a good book.  It's a collection of many of the crafts we have seen over the years, from her."
Home,3.0,Not for cheapskates like me,"As always, the pictures are lovely and the completed crafts unique and dazzling, but sadly, I wasn't very inspired.<br /><br />First off, there are a lot of thinsg to buy, many of them pricey and only found at craft stores and second, many of the crafts don't seem very durable, so basically you'd only have them for the one holiday and once you took them down they'd go straight into the garbage, frown.<br /><br />Her are some examples of these disposable crafts:<br /><br />Gilded pears - take some pears, cover them with real gold dust.  Done.  Not only am I skeezed out by the thought of making a perfectly edible food into a non edible art, GOLD DUST is frigging pricey!  Not to mention people starving, sorry, it just made me mad, it seems wildy inappropriate right now.<br /><br />Golden Walnut Ball - Stick walnuts, real ones, onto a ball, spray paint them gold. this one would probably last a holiday or two, but it is again, food being wasted.  I grew up in a trailerpark and wasting food bothers me, I know, get over yourself, but old habits and all that.<br /><br />Gourd Candles - Melt wax into a hollowed out gourd, light it on fire.  Okay, okay, there is no directive to light it on fire, and I will admit the candles are pretty and props for the fact that people don't eat gourds (can they be eaten?) but these will be a one-dinner-party attraction and I'm kinda craft-challenged, if I go to the expense and time of making something, I'd like it to be around for more than a couple of hours.<br /><br />But some of the crafts were genius, for example;<br /><br />A paper Sail centerpiece for a Thankgiving feast, the pictures show a perfectly pristine craft stick, but I think a dry stick from the garden could work just as well, same with the tiny bucket of rocks - I like that it's easily found and cheap!<br /><br />Pilgrim Hats and Bonnets - easily made by kids, talk about a real Thanksgiving celebration, you could really get into the spirit of Thanksgiving and everyone could make their own!<br /><br />Napkin rings made of paper or felt or acorns(I have a few acorns in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).  There's a big section at the back of the book with clip art for various crafts.  Very helpful.<br /><br />The crafts range in skill level from easy, pumkin pouch party favors (if you can use tape and scissors you're ready for this one) to the expert, pumpkin carving that DaVinci would approve of.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty comprehensive book, I only found a few crafts to try out myself, felt fortune cookies, flower pop up cards and the excellent directions for papier mache.  But mostly this is a book for the serious crafters who live next door to a Michaels Craft store.s in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).

Home,1.0,Not happy!!!!,"I ordered two of these.  One for me and one for a friend's Birthday.  I put mine together and charged the  battery overnite.  The next day I used it and it only ran for 3 to 5 min., then quit.  I couldn't believe it!!  I have several Swivel Sweepers and this has never happened!!!  I am very disappointed and I hope my Birthday  present for my friend DOES work??!!!  I, also, thought I was getting the Red Swivel sweeper (it showed a picture  of the Red one next to the order box,) but I GOT 2 bLACK ONES??!!  i do want a refund on my black one!!!!  Not happy  Georgia"
Home,1.0,Do Not Buy,Do not buy this unless you have completely nonporous wood or laminate floors. It's motor is not well equipped to handle anything but cheerios on laminate. I definitely do not recommend this ever!
Home,1.0,Swivel Sweeper quickly gives out,"I ordered the Swivel Sweeper because I am ill and cannot manage even a small vacuum. I've used it only several times. Now all of a sudden the battery charger is not working. I called the company, Ontek, and they have all sorts of excuses and tell me to go to Amazon since I purchased it here. I hope Amazon will honor the 90-day warranty, not even 2 months has gone by. Ontek is another example of a company that sells products and doesn't care a bit about whether they work or not."

Home,5.0,A must have for any of us Trekkies that grew up with TOS,Aa I said in the title this is a must have for any fan of TOS. Even if you only wear it as a tie tack once a year it's well worth the price. Only problem I have with it is that it seems on the small side. But that may just be perception as I am quite large.
Home,5.0,Great Idea book,Ordered this book for my grown daughter.  We love it.  So many ideas for all holidays.  I just may have to buy one for myself.
Home,1.0,This is the ORIGINAL swivel sweeper,"I thought this was the touchless model. But it is not. It is the 'original model', where the pan has to be completely removed from the machine to be dumped out. I suggest buying the touchless model, as I have owned all 3 models that Swivel Sweeper has come out with, and it is by far the best. Don't buy the G2 model is is very poorly constructed. The Original, and Touchless models have typically lasted me about 3 years of constant daily use. The G2 model lasted 3 months....."
Home,5.0,"Easy, simple and beautiful",This is a wonderful book if you are into DIY. Almost all of the projects have easy to follow instrucions and will add to any of your holiday fun.  There are crafts children can be involved in doing and materials are available at most craft shops.
Home,5.0,Great reference book!,"Lots of old ideas and lots of new ones. Some if not most of the crafts are great, \\""jumping off points\\"", to help you get your creative juices going. I will keep this book readily available for inspiration when I'm in the mood to craft/make gifts/change my decor around a bit. As with any of Martha's beautiful books, the pages are a delight for your eyes.  Good purchase for me. =D"
Home,5.0,Great Holliday Craft ideas,"A good craft book chock full of great ideas.  I made the Gourd Candles and they were fun and beautiful.  I received a lot of compliments.  I also used the pumpkin carving tips and carved the coolest pumpkin.<br /><br />There are many craft ideas for every Holliday from Hanukkah to the Fourth of July.  The crafts are fun and creative.  But, this is not a book for beginners.  The instructions aren't always clear and the pictures are needed, so you need to be a seasoned crafter."
Home,5.0,Perfect!,"Looks great, everyone compliments me on how it looks on the wall.<br />It holds really well the bottles, great quality metal construction.<br /><br />Will buy again, and may also use it as a gift :)"
Home,1.0,Afte4r 1 day it breaks?,"The first day after i received this sweeper i used it once and the handle broke. The \\""motor\\"" that powers it also screeches. i own another one I purchased from the manufacturer website, and bought one for my Mother too-neither of which i have ever had any problems with."
Home,3.0,Zombie buy instantly button,"I am really enjoying the book. Obviously, some parts I have to breeze right over because it is not applicable to my current circumstances, but the book will be great to have around if I ever need a source to review in emergencies. Zombie apocaplyse? Nah, probably not, but there are tons of good survival tactics for other uses. Sometimes when Max is talking about \\""ghouls\\"" or \\""undead,\\"" my mind will switch those words with enemy soldiers.   And as for that buy instantly button. WATCH YOURSELF! That thing is dangerous!"
Home,4.0,Excellent for holiday crafting,"This is,as Martha always does, clear and concise with wonderful photographic examples. I will refer to it frequently as a holiday crafting source."
Home,4.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,Like it very much.  It is handy and light weight with no cord to mess with.  It is just the thing for a quick pickup of lint and hair.
Home,1.0,Piece of Junk,"I bought the G2 (red version) of this in June and by September the battery would no longer work.  I was careful to follow the instructions and not leave in the battery in the charger too long.  I also had the original black one for several years before it died which I felt was reasonable for a $40 vacuum (and I was happy with its performance).  This was only lasted my 4 months and never worked as good as the original.  Based on the other reviews it doesn't look like the company will do anything about it.  I may try and return to bed, bath, & beyond where I purchased it from since I still have the receipt.  In the meantime I just purchased a similar one by Bissell from Lowes for $40 and bought the extended warranty for $7 dollars.  Lowes will replace the item one time if it breaks in the 2 years following the manufacture warranty and all I have to do is bring it back to Lowes.  I figured out there is a very good chance it will not last the 2+ years so the warranty was a good buy."
Home,2.0,Fair,this is the ssecond Swivel Sweeper I've purchased & this one seems somewhat slow even after I've charged it up.
Home,5.0,All year in one volume!,"Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts has fantastic homemade gift and decor ideas from New Year's to Christmas and every holiday in between. There are two hundred and twenty five of the best ideas which have been culled from the vast amount of crafts at Martha Stewart. It is beautifully photographed with clear step-by-step instructions and illustrations for the projects. Each chapter begins with a brief synopsis of each holiday and the common ideas associated with it.<br /><br />I loved the glossy, spooky fun \\""Jar-O'-Lanterns\\"", which are made by painting orange enamel paints onto glass jars and adding a wire handle and fun faces with black paint. Lovely pop-up bouquet cards are a perfect Mother's Day gift and the adorable money and gift card wrappers are great for the winter holidays. Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts makes it so convenient by having all of these wonderful crafts in one volume, and any one of these suggestions would change a normal holiday celebration into something truly magical!"
Home,5.0,Great year round reference,"Oh, I fully admit it - I love crafting and making stuff. When I get my hands on a book like Martha Stewarts' Handmade Hoiday Crafts, I wait for just the right time to read it. I then flip through randomly stopping at ideas that catch my eye first time through. When I pick it up the second time (again at the right time) I read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />And there are some fantastic ideas in this latest Martha offering. The book is geared towards crafts for all the major holidays - Valentine's Day, Mother and Father's Days, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, hanukkah, New year's, Easter and yes the one that is fast approaching - Christmas.<br /><br />And not every one is geared towards adults. There are lots of child friendly crafts that you can do with a small person in your life. There were some excellent ideas that I can see being used at the library - a doily as a stencil, thumb print hearts, heart and lollipop flowers and more. Ideas for colouring eggs? Oh boy, there were soooo many! I think I'll try decopaging some this coming year. Cards for every occassion with patterns for the pop ups featured. I'm not sure I could duplicate some of the elaborate pumpkin carving designs, but they're fun to look at. I have a bunch of buttons just begging to be used - the Mother's Day card is perfect.<br /><br />And lots of suggestions for Christmas and New Year's. There were some easy ideas for gift wrapping, cards and tags. And a really cute idea using wide ribbon as a gift bag for a gift certificate.<br /><br />I tried one of the gift tag ideas, using shipping tags, painting them and sticking on a piece of greenery. (The one on the left really needs a gold star on top)And I picked up some cookie cutters from the dollar store too. You could put some pretty Christmas paper behind to make ornaments. Or a photo, as I did - to remind a certain 20 something son of his time as one of Santa's elves! A great reference book to have on the shelf year round."

Home,5.0,Better than a broom and dust pan,"A Swivel Sweeper was purchased over two years ago for our dorm office. Our dorm is a female dorm and hair is everywhere. We have used the Swivel Sweeper in our office daily and had no problems. I gave the Swivel Sweeper 5 stars because it has performed better than expected over time. It gets into tight spaces, corners, and sweeps up all the dirt that would be left behind by a dust pan. However, lately the battery charges and then quickly loose the charge. The rotorary brushes spin freely when lifted off the ground but barely move when put on the floor. I recently cleaned the build-up of hair, this helped a little but the Swivel Sweeper is still not working correctly. I ordered a new Swivel Sweeper, extra batteries, and a spare charger. We also own two G2 Swivel Sweepers and use them in our home and travel trailer, with no problems so far."
Home,3.0,Maven Martha Made Miss This Time,"Here's the Scoop:'<br />There is no question that Martha Stewart has long been the reigning queen of DIY home crafts and decorations.  In this holiday-centered book, she has gathered the best of her ideas, giving us up-close and fully realized directions on how to create extraordinary crafts and gifts for home, family and friends. Martha doesn't disappoint her fans, and anyone is bound to find something beautiful to create in this holiday crafting book.<br /><br />Major holidays are segmented and ideas for crafts, home decorating and gift giving are shown for each one:  New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, July 4th, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas...and all others in between!  The large spread photographs are lovely, the ideas are not expensive, but are easily accessible; and, the resulting crafts present bright, festive, magical, and even enchanting pieces.<br /><br />Here's What I Liked:<br /><br />Valentine's Day:<br />Red tulips in double glass vases with red cinnamon candy hearts were vibrant, beautiful and made an easy presentation for a dinner arrangement. Also, a carnation heart made of multiples of pink carnations on floral foam to make a centerpiece is quick and gorgeous!<br /><br />Easter:<br />Fabulous egg-dyeing techniques using natural formulas made from coffee, cabbage, blueberries, beets and spices made incredibly beautiful and exotic eggs.  And, Martha gives specific directions for marbleizing eggs!  Actually, most of her egg crafting was exceptional.<br /><br />Thanksgiving:<br />Gourd candles made from hollowed out mini gourds with colored, melted candles are just amazing little jewels!  Pumpkin carving is fabulous!<br /><br />Christmas:<br />I loved the cookie cutter ornament ideas made from various paper goods, family pictures and such.  The gilded, and verdigris Polish inspired eggs, and the ribbon poinsettia wreath was just to die for.<br /><br />Hanukkah:<br />Paper packages, a menorah, and satin stars are glowing and sparkling in Martha's hands.<br /><br />Here's what I found lacking:<br /><br />Often the crafts are more complex than one would want to become engaged in.<br /><br />The directions are not clear cut; that is, they are not in a \\""recipe/materials\\"" format, but are listed in text, which I found to be more difficult to follow.  I needed to break it down for myself on my own paper.<br /><br />Diagrams sometimes took too much for granted, or at least seemed to expect the more experienced crafter could \\""fill in the blanks.\\""  I wasn't up to some of that!<br /><br />Several projects were quite time-consuming for very little return or impact.<br /><br />And, finally, I found the pictures too small in the working segments.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  3 stars ~ I can't hightly recommend it, but it's a good book to check out of the library...to become engaged in.

Home,1.0,Not Good,"I only used this product several times -- the handle broke.  I also didn't like the clear plastic because when I finished sweeping, you could see the dirt through it."
Home,5.0,A gift for my daughter,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She takes great pride in decorating and setting the mood when entertaining and knew that this book would bring her to that next level. She was taking a few days off at the holidays and was looking forward to sitting with a cup of coffee and planning her next holiday party.
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper First model G1,"Folks,  I have owned my black first generation swivel sweeper for 5 years now and I must say it has been great, we use it every day and I am still on the first two (2) batteries that came with the unit.  It picks up far more then I figured on a short pile rug and only lately I noticed the batteries are a bit weak.  So I put them on the charger for more then eight hours and they are back up to speed.  With my model you do have to go through picking out the fibers and thread it picks up and give it a good cleaning, but it has been solid for me.  I agree that the handle is very light duty but I have never had it break.  I almost bought the two(2) for one(1) sale on the new G2, but the shipping was the killer.  I would think free shipping would be in order or shipping around $8.95.  Remember the ad if it fits, it ships, they should use the USPS and then the 2 for 1 deal makes sense.  Most all companies offer free shipping for real from time to time.  I am sure the company would still make great profits."
Home,1.0,Disgusted,I bought this item 2 months ago $75 and unable to use it ... I have bought at least 8 different bottles of wine and the holes our so large on the wine rack the bottles can fall out I called the company for help and emailed no luck.. Nice piece if I can use it
Home,5.0,Lego is getting it right,This is a very good set and has very many details.I would not expect someone who is not very experienced with lego building to be able to build this by themselves because the stickers/decals can be difficult to put on and the roof can be difficult to snap onto the rest of the structure. over all this is a nice set and it is nice to see sets that are more appealing to girls and don't worry regurlar minifigures fit fine in the cafe.
Home,5.0,no excuse NOT to craft now!,"Being a mother of three children brings me numerous opportunities to desire projects for them.  In this particular craft book of Martha Stewart, there are a variety that appear to be a wonderful choice to use with my girl and two boys.  In particular, as we are now past the Christmas and New Year holidays, I am enthralled with the presentations of Valentine's Day and spring creations!  As is typical of the style from the publisher, the projects, materials, and how-tos are presented clearly, with eye-catching photographs and a classy style all around.  It always inspires me to see a collection of things which are threaded together in themes-  there are several of such sets of projects to complete.  Be inspired and delighted with all the ideas in this book as my children and I are!"

Now she's serving cakes, milkshakes and hamburgers to all her lego friends. The set is very well designed, with details that add so much character to it. My daughter and I both LOVE the new design, and LOVE the new design of minifigures as well..they're so cute!"
Home,1.0,Do not buy this!,This sweeper didn't work from the get go and forget about getting a replacement without paying for it big time.  It will be cheaper for us to buy a new one then to get a replacement from them.  The customer service is horrible.  Why should I have to pay for replacement parts when the product didn't work in the first place.  This is ridiculous. Save your money and buy a better one.
Home,5.0,Perfect broom and dust pan replacement- great customer service!,"I received my sweeper, charged the battery and had a go with it- it is perfect for cleaning up cat hair and litter,crumbs dust bunnies ,hair even leaves that blew in through an open door ,I use it on tile, wood and concrete. This is not a vacuum replacement but it replaces my broom and dust pan ( my overpriced vacuum only works on carpet!).My broom left lots behind - this sweeper picks it all up! BUT the battery died after about 3min.  I did not want the hassle of sending it back for a replacement so I contacted the company ( ONTEL) and ask for a replacement battery- off course they wanted to see the receipt which I e-mailed and my new battery was on the way free of charge.  Cleaning the brushes is a bit easier than my standard vacuum- since the handy thread cutter is included and the clear cover over the brushes lifts off for easy access.  It is a little noisy but not as much as a handheld vac."
Home,4.0,Great Little Picker-Upper,"I'm on my 3rd swivel sweeper so they must be doing something right because I keep buying them. As as been mentioned by other reviewers, the sweeper has no vacuum capability - just a brush on each side. They are fantastic for picking up the miscellaneous debris tracked in by my dogs and I can run one around the house in a matter of minutes. The weakness is the battery. I had my first sweeper for a couple of years before the battery gave out. My next one was the G2 model and it only lasted a couple of months so I went back to the original. I'm going to baby the battery on this one because it's a very useful little gadget."
Home,4.0,The Fictionators Review,"The great thing about it is the awesome projects for so many holidays. I loved so many of them, and definitely feel inspired by lots of things in here.  I really liked the pictures and how many holidays are covered. I did not like that the directions and a separate supply list for each project was not provided.  Several people said that many of the supplies that are recommended are expensive, and I agree. However, I think that crafty people in general look for alternatives that are more in their price range, so that wasn't really an issue for me.<br /><br />If you've got a choice between an ebook and the real thing, I definitely say go for the real thing--you are going to want to have this out all year long."
Home,2.0,Many dog ears,"I received my order 1.5mth after I first made an order for it. The 2nd disappointment was, it came with dog ears on almost every page of the book except the back page. I was so ashamed to give it away as a gift ( as I have originally intended to) that I kept it for myself."
Home,4.0,"As advertised, and I am impressed","I was sceptical but heard good things from a friend. This is as advertised!  It does a great job. We have loved this new \\""tool\\""."

Home,1.0,Definately NOT NEW AND IMPROVED,"Wife purchased a Swivel Sweeper 6 years ago. Loved it and used it alomost every day until it no longer would hold a charge.  She had been looking for a new one for several months so I purchased this one as a Xmas gift. TERRIBLE QUALITY. The new one has about half of the bristles of the old one and sounds like a \\""stone crusher\\"" it's so loud. Does not pick up nearly a quarter of dust/debris as the original. I don't know who made the decision in the company to \\""improve\\"" this, but plesae go back to the old formula."
Home,5.0,Excellent,"Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts is a weighty tome chock full of great ideas on how to decorate for the Holidays. Decorations range from easy- making a centerpiece out of wheat, to hard- handmade wreaths and cinnamon decorated bird ornaments for the tree!<br /><br />Martha Stewart's projects are all lovingly photographed and documented and look really stunning in their simplicity. I particularly loved the decorations for Halloween such as the jack-0-lanterns and the treat bags shaped like pumpkins. Other favorites were the giant bird silhouette window, the instructions on how to fold napkins and the cute Pilgrim costumes for Thanksgiving, turkeys, and sail's for the table.<br /><br />The photographs are all really well done too. There really is never a question how the finished item is supposed to look. The index at the end includes places where you can purchase items for the projects in the book, and also include templates. This book is a must have for the holiday crafter in your life.<br /><br />Review copy courtesy of Netgalley"

Home,5.0,Swivel sweeper,"I love my swivel sweeper.  This is my second one.  The battery stopped charging on my first one.  I ordered another battery, which worked until I tried to recharge it.  It will not charge on my new sweeper charger either.  But I like the sweeper enough to invest in a second one."
Home,5.0,Great legos for girls,Our oldest child (boy) has loved legos forever and hated having to share them with 4 younger sisters. Now are daughters are starting their own collections and are very happy with the new lego friends sets.  The colors are very bright and vibrant and the directions easy to follow.  They love playing with them and the little accessory pieces even make it more fun for them.  Great toy---about time Lego!!
Home,5.0,Lego Launches a New Tie Fighter,"This is Lego's newest version of the Tie Fighter. There have been a dizzying number of Tie sets: there were a few standard Tie Fighters (#7146 and #7263), Darth Vader's variant (#7150 and #8017), Tie Bomber (#4479), Tie Intercepter (#6209), and the hyper-drive equipped Tie Defender (#8087). There have been two Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) Tie Fighters: Vader's (#10175) and an Intercepter (#7181). Set 9492, introduced in January of 2012, is arguably the best of the standard, playable Tie Fighters to date. The UCS sets are in their own league as they place a premium on authenticity over playability, and carry high price tags as well. And there have been mini-scale Tie Fighters as well.  The major change with this version is the construction of the radiators, the large black hexagonal panels on each side of the craft. In addition to the usual plates, Lego has run a band of tile around the edge (a technique more commonly referred to as studs-not-on-top, or SNOT). Along with smaller detailing, the radiators are a much better representation than prior sets, and they are arguably stronger. Another change in the design evolution is the use of a new cockpit window that is more cleanly spherical. Beyond this, the design features are smaller, such as the use of side-facing roof tiles to give the craft sharper edges.  The set comes with a pilot, an imperial officer, Death Star trooper, and R5-J2 droid. The trooper's helmet is new and nicely designed, as is the droid's new conical head. The craft also has two flick-fire missiles situated underneath the cockpit dome.  In terms of playability, this set is not as interesting as Lego's new X-Wing fighter (#9493), but I believe the general thinking is that kids (or their parents) will buy the X-Wing or Millennium Falcon (7965) first, and then buy the Tie Fighter so they can stage a dogfight. In this regard, the new Tie Fighter is a great set and does an admirable job of being the bad guy. Parents, you are forewarned that, depending on the age of your children, you may be conscripted into fixing battle damaged Lego spacecraft; I think this is a fair exchange for a toy that can be built and modified. Until children learn to fix the craft on their own, it can be very frustrating for a parent, even one that loves Lego. Patience Iago, patience. Inner peace, inner peace. Find a happy place. Serenity now.  As I mention in my other Lego reviews, you can go to Youtube and search for lengthy reviews of this set. It helps to see this craft handled."
Home,4.0,"Very cute, but not as ""Lego"" as some","My 8yo daughter loves building Legos (as do her two brothers) and loved the look of these sets when she saw them come out and bought this one with her own money.  It's cute, it's girly, but it's not as \\""Lego\\"" as a \\""traditional\\"" set. Of the 222 pieces, SO MANY of them are \\""accessories.\\""  Utensils, foods, etc.  Not very much for building and more for playing very teeny pretend play.  But you're paying Lego prices for that.  It competes well with things like littlest pet shop, ponies, etc, but not so well with other lego sets.  My daughter also has some other lego favorites she thinks are cool - the lighthouse with the light-up brick, the camping trailer with car to pull it (we own a camper), the 3-in-1 fishing cabin, etc.  For actual building, you get more bang for your buck with the \\""traditional\\"" sets. They are also more challenging and time-consuming which she likes.  It hardly took any time at all to put this set together and now it just sits on her shelf.  I'm actually kinda personally offended that they made it this way.  I'm sure some kids will love the quick put-together but can't Lego come out with some \\""girl\\"" sets that aren't SO girly?"
Home,5.0,"Solid LEGO set, somewhat boring build","This Tie Fighter LEGO set results in a very solid-feeling, relatively large (around 1 foot tall) model that seems like it will be very durable and fun to play with.  The wings are definitely not going anywhere (unless you really pulled it apart) and it just feels sturdy.  The only minor exception to this is the cockpit cover, which falls off relatively easily when opening and closing it, but otherwise stays solidly in place.  The only downside to this set is that it's pretty boring to build.  The center module is moderately challenging and fun, and doing one half of one of the wings is also challenging and fun. The boring part is that each wing is identical, and each half of each wing is also identical, so you build the half wings four times and then attach them near the end.  The instructions are oddly confusing here too, because they put \\""x2\\"" in several places, which made sense after reading through it all, but it actually meant you had to do big sections x4 (x2x2). Total build time about 1.5 hrs. Comes in three bags; first bag is center unit with two smaller bags inside, and other two bags are one wing each. If you can figure out how to share the instruction book, you could easily do these out of order.  If you're like me, and you prefer enjoying the end result that you built rather than the build process itself, the boring build isn't that big of a deal, so I still give it 5 stars.  I noted it here, though, in case it's something that's important to you."
Home,2.0,Disappointing design & doesn't hold together,"We purchased this for my 6-year-old Star Wars Lego-obsessed son, after months of anticipation for its release. We returned it the next day. The build was fine - neither interesting nor too complicated, although too particular for him to do on his own correctly. But the problem is the playability - it has fallen apart 5 times in one day of play. The wings regularly come off, which messes up the core ship & needing a rebuild from scratch. If you put the wings back on and press too hard, the entire core collapses.  This is the only Lego item we've ever gotten that falls apart so easily. Buyer beware if you're getting for a young kid to play with."
Home,4.0,Fast and Easy Clean Up,"I am very pleased with this product. Having only the use of one arm, this makes sweeping the floor a cinch !!

With this product, I can quickly and easily sweep the floors with one arm. I am very pleased with this !!"

Home,1.0,Swivel Powerless,"Thsi products has no power at all.  I contacted the company several times and have yet to hear back.  Don't buy it, it doesn't pick up."
Home,1.0,Don't Buy This One,"I strongly recommend against purchasing the Swivel Sweeper.  The idea is good, but the quality is terrible.  Battery life is less than 1 minute. After purchasing a replacement battery and charging it exactly as indicated by the directions, the battery lasts approximately 30 seconds - $20 down the drain. Surely someone, even in China, can do better than this with battery technology."
Home,5.0,Beautiful!,"I had been looking at this item for a few months trying to decide if it was really worth the money.  It was!!  Installation took about 15 minutes , mostly which consisted of getting the wine holder level and making sure the holes were alligned.  I highly recommend you get at least 50lb drywall anchors, it's worth the $2.00 and trip to the hardware store to not have the thing come out of the wall when fully loaded with wine bottles. (which could probably weigh anywhere between 25-35lbs when all eight bottles are in) It really is beautiful and a showpiece in the room."
Home,5.0,Piece of art,"This set is a piece of art. I was stunned that the wing borders fit on so perfectly, and there is a little piece on the front and back corners of the wing to keep the grey border from sliding off. The struts on the side look amazing and are likewise expertly crafted. The cockpit is not perfectly round but the designers did an admirable job with their choice of LEGO bricks.  I may be the minority, but I also love that it comes with flick-fire missiles. They never get old.  The minifigures are great. The TIE fighter pilot has a face under the helmet, but it's kind of pale since it is printed on a black head. Still fun, though. This is also my first Imperial Officer, which is exciting.  The wings connect to the body a lot better than previous iterations. They don't wobble as much when you're swooshing it around your house, and they don't fall off as easily. The wings are made up of lots of plates, so you have to keep an eye out for pieces coming loose during play, but usually it all holds together well.  The TIE fighter is bigger than I thought. It looks slightly out of scale to both the 6206 TIE Interceptor and 8017 Darth Vader's TIE. But the size of the model makes the price a little easier to swallow."
Home,5.0,Finally Lego figured it out!,"I bought for my daughter's 7th birthday this week.  She can't put them down.  She has had other Lego sets - some of the city sets - that didn't get played with very frequently. She had absolutely no interest in the Star Wars and other more violent oriented sets.  Because this one has multiple people and is oriented toward more role-play, it appeals to her much more. It's nice to see that Lego finally figured out that they've been ignoring about half of their potential market (girls) and are now doing something to appeal to them. It's nice that the little people have hair and clothes that can be switched out."
Home,4.0,Nice toy to play with your kids and spend some time,"My daughter wanted this toy as she played in the Lego store, she was really excited and we spend some time putting it together, she likes to assemble it but after a while she just get a little bored because every time you assemble it you need to read the manual. I still say is a good product but I'm thinking in buying separate pieces of lego next time so we can build what ever we want"
Home,4.0,Fun Build,"This TIE Fighter was a great build. I have several minifig scale Star Wars models and a big fan of this one. It's a great recreation from the movie and has a lot of detail. As always the instructions were easy to follow, and I really like the numbered bags for a more structured build. I'm not sure why LEGO doesn't do this with all their sets over a few hundred bricks.<br /><br />I don't play with these much - more for display than anything else, but I imagine this would hold up well to fairly rigorous play.<br /><br />Recommended for the LEGO Star Wars fan."
Home,5.0,a fine product,"The swivel sweeper does all that it advertises to do. And that should be enough to recommend it, which I do to all my friends. It is is perfect for light duty sweep ups. The battery lasted for 4 years and is replaceable."

Home,5.0,High Value Add to Optimizing Roomba 780's R2R Navigation & Cleaning Efficiency.,"One pair came with my Roomba 780.  Each LH runs on a pair of \\""C\\"" alkaline batteries estimated by manufacturer to last 6 months.  We shall see.<br /><br />On the LH are two switches, the top one provides you the option of toggling it's function as either a Light House or a Virtual Wall. By strategically placing the Light Houses, one can divide the cleaning area into two sections and the pair together divides the cleaning area into 3 cleaning areas - to be cleaned in succession one after the other, the LHs signals for Roomba to systematically complete one area before allowing it to move into & clean the next area, and in turn the third area.  This way the cleaning is more effectively managed for better results.  When all the sections are complete, the LHs navigate the Roomba back to its charging base.  This is what is referred to as the \\""Room To Room Navigation\\"" capability.  A very useful feature for the larger home.<br /><br />The Virtual wall OTOH, simply prohibits the Roomba from crossing to the other side.  This works to keep Roomba out of areas not requiring cleaning or the Scooba from your carpets or expensive rugs.<br /><br />My first run took 1 hour to clean 150sqf.  Today I deployed the LHs and Roomba effectively cleaned each section for 25mins each before returning to it's base. Beautiful navigation. The same upstairs.  I can't praise the 780 enough.  If you are deciding between the 770 and 780, and your home can be discretely sectioned, get the 780.  If you are in a studio apartment, then the Room to Room Navigation is uneccessary.<br /><br />Roombas 577 and 780 comes with a pair each."
Home,5.0,Functional Art Piece,"This wine rack is a well made, Modern and functional.  IT is basically a piece of art.  I purchased two and placed them linearly down the wall for a huge statement pice.  The rack holds the bottles securely and will hold various sizes of bottles.  I have had the rack installed for only a few short weeks and anyone who comes over always has a positive comment.  Be sure to locate a stud in the wall to secure the rack since it will be holding a good amount of weight.  The mounting system is basically  3 screws into the wall and doesnt give much flexibility if you have to be on a stud.  Overall it was easy to install in about 10 minutes once the location was selected.  I would purchase again.  Thumbs up if you are looking for a artpiece with some function."
Home,5.0,Clean Sweep,I have already had a number of these sweepers and have given numerous as gifts.  It's not as thorough as a vacuum cleaner but for quick clean-ups it really does the job.

Home,2.0,Shonky feel like a toy but it works...don't expect a HEPA -Vac for the quick spruce up of the front porch or back patio,"IN SUMMARY:<br />Don't expect a hepa vac or a hoover windtunnel but for me it certainly did a quick and rough spruce up of my small entrance foyer and back patio that is always getting light sprinklings of grass & woodchip debris, dead leaves and palm seeds.  Still - running it felt like a noisy toy from the 60s. Easy enough to empty with note to REMEMBER NOT TO turn the sweeper upside down as debris could fall out of the two gaps there. Great portability for seniors.  Shonky quality but for the price $20 - it goes where the iRobots are not allowed to go.  I wonder what the differences are to the G2 and G3 (battery life aside)  ANOTHER DOWNSIDE: CHARGER DOES NOT INDICATE WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL - I find myself wondering when to take it out.  Read a lot of review of peeps frying their batteries or needing to buy new ones.  SNEAKY!<br />=======================================================================================<br /><br />Mine came RED, but is NOT the G2 or G3 after all - I am hoping it's not a fake (I see a lot of black units when not G2 or G3)...<br /><br />Got this online for $19.95 plus $11 shipping.<br />A little carried away when I first noticed it, I had not realised there is a 2nd and 3rd generation which has better batteries, the 90degree elbow joint and touchless bin opener.<br />Package arrived today and here's the take.<br /><br />Features are great.  Quality is iffy.  I can't imagine this unit was sold previously for $98 (claimed online) unless there is a drop in quality specs or change of manufacturing source. The handle is a two part screw on like the pledge swiffer - just feels a lot flimsier.  Like the battery charger and battery which is currently charging for at least 8hrs prior to use.  Glad though that the shaft is \\""bendable\\"" though the mechanism felt very flimsy.  Even happier that the \\""touchless bin\\"" is there.

The manouver was less than ideal as the Sweeper \\""Stick\\"" was not as rigid as one would like due to the many joints and parts making it already \\""rickety\\"". If more robust, would keep this for the stairs.  Post-cleaning: Lint, hair and fluff is wound around the bearings and the need to pick fluff out of the bristle is a real chore.<br /><br />Second run results [on back patio for picking up palm seeds and light dirt & debris] - was originally intending the SS for our small patio (trees are always shedding something) but seem very underpowered and I wonder if the bristles are heavy duty enough to withstand the non slip surface. UPDATE: OK, so I had a quick run of the SS at the front porch picking up grass debris and fallouts from a wasp nest - worked like a dream despite the light suction. It managed to pick up palm seeds very quickly, wood chip debris and your small to average sized dried leaves quite well.  Due to low suction, you may need repeat sweeping action (2-3x) to get the result you want.ong it takes to finish the job and wear & tear.<br /><br />First run [on stair carpet]:<br />After 9-10 hour charge, sounded underpowered but was quite surprisingly able to pick up carpet lint and debris on stairs with just a light swivel rolling motion (w/o force).

Home,4.0,"Great looking toy, pretty boring build though","Being someone who's not in the suggested age range for such a toy, obviously my opinion will be a little different from a kid's.  That said, this piece looks great.  Absolutely badass and is pretty much a must have.  If you can get it for ~$0.10/piece, then go for it.  But, the reason why it's not perfect is the build is absolutely boring as heck.  As is expected given the complexity of the ship itself, and the fact that it's just mainly two big \\""wings\\"".  It's definitely wise to build both wings at the same time, but on the other hand, that decreases the length of the build time.  But given how boring a build it is, it's better to just get it over with and get to the final presentation.  Several people have said that it's flimsy, but i've had no problems with mine.  The key is with the final \\""bracket\\"" pieces that you slide on to each individual wing before sliding the wing onto the center cockpit piece.  You gotta make sure you press each leg onto the wing solidly and INDIVIDUALLY.  Once you do, this thing isn't gonna fall apart.  If your 8 yr old kid is trying to accomplish this, then that's probably why it's falling apart so easily.  That bracket needs a pretty good amount of force to get the studs into the female receptors.<br /><br />At the end of the day, way too quick a build, but it looks fantastic.  Would love to have a squadron of these, but at the price point, that'd be hard to do."

Home,4.0,"Eerie, surreal, and beautiful","I tend to choose tarot decks based solely on aesthetics. With most, it's a bit of a process. I pick them up, turn them over and over in my hands, put them down, walk away. I'll go home and think about it. Do I really need another deck of cards right now? Can I find them used? I'll go back to the store and pretend to browse other things in the same general area, all the while knowing that I'm having a man versus self moment.<br /><br />The day I purchased these cards, there was no decision process. I picked up the box and never put it down. It was either pay for it or a misdemeanor. Included in the set are the card deck, instruction booklet, and spread poster.<br /><br />The illustrations on the cards are best described as modern surrealism. As the name suggests, the moon is featured and visible on each of the seventy-eight cards in the pack. The pack also contains a title card as well as information about the artist. The illustrations themselves are bright, bold, dynamic, and intriguing. On a few occasions, I've found myself being drawn in to the vignettes. Each card features an illustration. Some of the traditional archetypes of the tarot are portrayed, but each card has its own story and personality. The cards are very reminiscent of the films of Neil Gaiman (Mirrormask, Neverwhere).<br /><br />The deck size and card weight is fairly standard. The card corners are slightly rounded, the cards shuffle well, and they are fairly easy to manage.<br /><br />As someone who's been reading cards for over twenty years, I would not necessarily recommend the cards to someone starting out. Because the artwork differs so greatly from the Rider-Waite deck (which seems to be the standard deck used for learning card interpretation), it may be a little daunting to adjust to the slightly sinister nature of this pack. The instruction booklet is generic at best. Beyond the author's dedication, the information is pretty standard across all decks produced by US Games."

Home,5.0,Love those coils!,"I started with the basic Coiling Gizmo (Econo Winder) and loved it, so I bought the Deluxe Coiling Gizmo to get cranking rods in more sizes. This is a great tool for making coils, and this version also includes an attached clamp, which appears to be screwed on, so I guess you could remove it if you need to. It appears very durable, and I love the length and sizes of coils I can make with the crank rods. The \\""working area\\"" of the crank rods is just under 8 inches.<br /><br />I was frustrated that the product description did not give the diameters of the five crank rods, so I emailed Artistic Wire, who always respond promptly. Their response: \\""Unfortunately, we do not have exact sizes for the rods. As they can vary slightly. If you are looking at this tool to make jump rings for chain maille. It does not have the precise measurements needed for that function.\\""<br /><br />So, I measured them myself. My \\""Digital Thickness Gauge\\"" seems inconsistent, so I used my SWG wire gauge (I don't have an AWG gauge). With it, they measured 18-gauge (1.22mm), 15-gauge (1.83mm), 10-gauge (3.25mm), 8-gauge (4.06mm) and 6-gauge (4.88mm). (For those of you who might have the Econo Winder, for comparison purposes, the crank rod sizes on mine are the same as the 1.2mm and 1.83mm rods on the Deluxe.) Of course, according to the Artistic Wire email, others might not have the same sizes.<br /><br />I bought it off eBay for $14.99, and sadly, I saw today that my local Michael's store has started carrying it just this week (they have improved their jewelry-making tools section) and their price is $10.99, which is the same price as on the Artistic Wire website. With no shipping cost and Michael's almost-continuous 40% off coupon, I could have gotten it there for $6.60. So, I might have to buy another for when I wear this one out."

Right now I am using a rubber broom on my wood floors. I am hoping to find a quality electric sweeper that works great, is affordable and lasts more than a year."
Home,5.0,Fab wine rack!,What a fab wine rack! It is exactly as described and installation was a piece of cake. Very nice! This was purchased for a client's wine bar. Now I want one for our home...may need to order a 2nd one...
Home,3.0,missing pieces,This product had missing pieces. It was quite disappointing for my nephew. It was a birthday gift and he has to wait for the missing parts.
Home,5.0,I love this sweeper,I'm ordering my THIRD sweeper.  The first one had the old battery. I purchased the red battery and it once again runs great and at the same time  ordered a new swivel sweeper for our cottage.  The first sweeper is so old though that the top cracked and altho I could order just that piece I am ordering my third.  I love these sweepers for small jobs.  It's great for the cottage cuz we don't have padding under any of the rugs and the sweeper runs almost as good on those rugs as on the wood floors.  The red battery just goes and goes.  I don't underestand why so many people are having problems with theirs.

Home,4.0,Lots of great ideas,"I saw this at Michael's and thought it was a good one to add to my library. I was very happy to find it here and sure enjoyed looking through it after I received it. I haven't made anything yet but I know I will. I was hoping there were card ideas using all her new punches but not in this book. I do hope she does one soon. Anyway, good book and will give you food for thought..!!"
Home,1.0,Zero Stars,"Same as other reviewers, the battery is the problem with this device. It will not hold a charge and will only last 30 seconds before needing a new charge or the terminals being cleaned. Otherwise, it is a good product for what I need it for-quick cleaning of crumbs under the table and bar after meals, getting dust bunnies out from under low pieces of furniture. It wasn't designed for more in depth cleaning. You will need your big gun for that. I have an Oreck. Nothing compares to that."
Home,5.0,Know what you are getting,"Several things .... I talked to the folks at iRobot and you can have a max of three of these in \\""lighthouse\\"" mode since each room takes about 25 minutes and three rooms is all the battery will last. You can use as many as you want in Virtual Wall mode. These work well for the 780 BUT the item is white and not black like the pictures. It's all in the part numbers."
Home,5.0,Legos City Set a Winner,Legos are tried and true - my granddaughter loved this birthday gift!  She spent birthday money to get more of the set and plays with it constantly. And Granny loved the ease of ordering it from Amazon.
Home,5.0,Love this set!!!,My daughter LOVES this series of Legos!!  Its wonderful to finally have a lego set that is intended for girls!!
Home,5.0,Perfect for the first timers,"I got it for my 6 year old as a birthday gift. She has never played with LEGO before (she has never been in to the blocks). She loved every part of it: building the coffee shop (it is pretty easy to assemble), adding all accessories, playing with it. This product is high quality: description of assembly is easy for 6 year old to understand, all the pieces fit as they are supposed to, there is tons of cute accessories like utensils, milkshakes glasses, pots ect. The only complaint we have is about tarts (or cupcakes). They are plastic forms with unattached lego dots, so the dots fall out easily. they are so tiny that is really hard to find them. We may have to use some super glue;))). Overall we love this product!"
Home,5.0,Excellent Starfleet Badge Replica,"Great product! It looks awesome and you won't be disapointed in the quality of this Starfleet replica. I've worn it several times, and it always stays secured to my shirt or jacket very well. It actually looked better than I expected it too. Overall, this product is awesome."
Home,5.0,Great set!,"This set is so great!  It has three awesome characters and the Geonosian Starfighter which drops bombs!  And is a very durable set.  I really recommend it and the characters have really nice decals on them and commander Cody is a very nice character you must have!  So get this set!  Great mini-figures, great Starfighter,  great set!"
Home,3.0,"Easy to Build, Small for Play","This set was extremely easy to build, but it will be frustrating for some for playtime, as things like the accessories are so teeny tiny (and there are what seems like a zillion accessories). For example the cash register comes with money, but good luck in trying to get the money out! Same with the oven and the pan, the ice cream machine spouts kept falling off, the characters hair won't stay on... My daughters also really got frustrated with the cupcakes as the small round pieces don't snap in and keep falling out. All in all, it's a very cute set but I am wishing now that I would have went with something non-lego that was a little more sturdier and easier for playing with."
Home,4.0,"Son loves it, looks cool, not the most durable lego creation","My son loves the Star Wars Lego line-- We build them together (though he could do it alone, I'm sure... but he's impatient when he gets them, and this goes quicker!)and then he runs around the house with them and has battles.<br /><br />His other Lego fighters are pretty sturdy-- You can play with them and crash them and pop pieces off to pretend they're damaged without having too much work figuring out how to replace them-- But I think this TIE Fighter is a little different then, say, the X-wing.  The x-wing is a sturdy beast!  Even with my son's own modifications (he likes to have a gunner pointing back, since that is where the enemy fire always succeeded in the first movie), we really haven't had too much difficulty with it. That can't be said so emphatically about the TIE Fighter, though it's still a really cool set!<br /><br />I know someone else commented on another's review that if you want to play with them, you should buy the non-lego play sets for Star Wars-- but the beauty, to me, is that with lego-- you CAN pretend to battle them and have \\""real\\"" damage.  You can also modify them to be better fighters, as my son did with the x-wing.  Legos are, after all, toys-- not models.<br /><br />So... with that in mind-- The TIE Fighter is certainly a more fragile lego toy then the other Star War ships.  The side \\""wings\\"" (or whatever they are) are big and are made of smaller pieces, kept flat, so of course they aren't the most durable structures.  I plan to try to get some larger black flat pieces to sort of reinforce the seams a bit.  Though this will be less flat, I think it will hold up better.  They also attach to the actual \\""ship\\"" (the little ball in the middle)in kind of a fragile way... and I really don't know how they could've done that better-- But it hasn't been too much of an issue.  The only thing is-- when something does \\""pop\\"" in that area, a major reconstruction is necessary to replace things.  (But this is also partly because my son tries to do it himself without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.  My son went into this knowing that (we read reviews before we ordered) and while it's caused a bit of frustration, I still think he is very happy with it and does not regret ordering it!  (BTW-- my son is 8)<br /><br />When I ordered this, it was $5 cheaper then at the lego site.  Even so, I still can't give a lego star wars kit 5 stars but that is ONLY BECAUSE OF PRICE.  I know a lot of design must go into these things and I don't want to undervalue that aspect-- but in reality, we are talking plastic bricks.  When ANY lego set costs 300 bucks (the death star) and it's really just a bunch of plastic bricks, I can't help but think it just may be over priced....self without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.

Home,1.0,Don't bother,"Bought this as a Christmas present to replace an older model whose battery was shot. Also bought a replacement battery for the older unit. The new unit doesn't have the same speed/power of the older one with the new battery. And the battery is about dead after 5 minutes of use. And a fully charged battery is so weak after a week of sitting in the closet the unit won't even run. However, the older model with the new battery works better than ever. I wasted money buying a new sweeper. And the new sweeper won't accept the new battery I bought for the older sweeper."

It's a great build, the side panels were particularly fun to put together.  The minifigures are also new, and just as fun.  Pick this thing up so your X-wing has something to shoot down!"
Home,1.0,Failed after a little more than 2 months use,"UPDATE 9/11/12<br /><br />The first bulb I bought which I installed in my central hallway has burned out after a little more than 2 months of use.  It was installed on July 4th and burned out on September 11th.  My hall light is on most of the time (it is really only out when no-one is at home).  I would estimate the bulb lasted 600-800 hours....very disappointing.<br /><br />----- earlier review<br />Not much to say about this product.  It does appear to be the same brightness as a 50W bulb as advertised.  I placed this one in my central hallway which is lit almost all the time I'm home (I previously had a CFL in that location).  In 10 years I think this fixture has had two CFL's replaced since it's on about 14 hours a day (it's off when I leave for work).  The light is a slightly yellow warm white.<br /><br />The nice thing about this bulb is that it is almost exactly the same form factor as regular lightbulb, so it should be able to fit in any normal fixture.  This was a problem in one of my bathrooms with a very tiny fixture. I think a good pricepoint for this type of light would be about $5-$7.  The current $10 (at the time I'm writing this) is a little bit high, but would be fine if you need it for a fixture that is lit most of the day.<br /><br />It would have a cost savings even against a CFL, and certainly against a regular bulb.  If you are replacing a conventional incandescent bulb, this bulb should have a pay-back time of only about 1400 hours if your local electrical cost is $0.12/kW-hr.  If you replacing a CFL this would have a much longer payback time (several years), since a CFL is already very efficient.  If you factor in the cost of the CFL, and that these last much longer than a fluorescent bulb, the payback gets much better, again on the order of 1000-2000 hours (depending on the life-span and cost of the CFL you are replacing).<br /><br />You should be aware that while these bulb have an extremely long life span (great for those really hard to reach fixtures), they do very gradually get dimmer over the years."

Home,5.0,Got this as a gift...and I'm 37!  Love it.,"As a mom of two boys we have more LEGOs in this house than I can count, and I've nearly stepped on more than my feet can take. When I saw these new \\""Friends\\"" sets at the LEGO store I was immediately fascinated. Girl LEGOS! I mean really, who cares, boys can play with them and girls can play with the other LEGOs...but still. My inner child kicked in and I was in love. Apparently it was totally obvious, so my husband and boys got me this set as a gift.<br /><br />It's just adorable, and I love the accessories. A cute little mixer, bowls...the pastries are darling! It was relaxing, if not cathartic, to put it together while the boys were napping. Then when they woke up LEGO Batman and Catwoman had a chase scene through the Cafe while Indiana Jones sat down for a cupcake and a beverage. Love it. ;-)"
Home,5.0,Great toy for girls to practice visual manipulation and building,"I love that Lego has finally created a set that girls are excited about.  I picked up this set for $10, which really made me happy.  But seeing my 5 year old reading the directions and figuring out how the pieces went based on the pictures is what made it all worthwhile.  The figures and food fit in with girl play styles.  Highly recommend."

It's metal and exactly the perfect size to fit on a star fleet shirt and look authentic it's shiny has a nice box with it and I'm very pleased with the seller and will purchase more items from them in the future.

My first thought was to add a StarFleet insignia which Amazon had quite a few of. I ordered this over Amazon Prime and although there was an error in shipping, I still received it in two days. Build quality is superb, the pins are intact and it even has a nice weight to it due to the materials used. For cosplayers, Trekkies or collectors, I highly recommend this item especially for the price. Thanks Amazon. You're come though for me again."

Home,1.0,"Original, Old Model Swivel Sweeper","Sorry I bought 2 of these but I went with the original, old model because the shaft is stronger than the newer G2 model.  Ours snapped right in half.<br /><br />What I forgot about was with the original, old model it is a pain to dump the waste because you have to take the bottom tray off and dump it into the garbage can, hoping you don't spill it all over the place.<br />This doesn't happen with the newer G2 model.  With it, one presses a button, the bottom opens and the waste dumps out.<br /><br />And another thing the original, old model does is that it can easily flip itself over when vacuuming dumping the contents all over the floor that you just vacuumed up!  This flipping does not happen with the newer G2 model either.<br /><br />Swivel Sweepers are handy for quick vacuuming, nothing heavy duty."

Home,5.0,Fantastic looking!,"The wall mounted holder looks great on the wall, it is said numerous times in these reviews that it looks like a work of art and in many ways it is very true.  Certain wine bottles don't fit in to the holes all that well and will leave them angled up or down instead of straight out, for instance, if the bottle has a higher curve towards the neck of the bottle.  However, most bottles work perfectly fine in the holder, I put a wide variety of shapes in mine and they all looked fine. Not all bottles look good sitting on their side in conventional holders either, so I wouldn't let that be a determining factor when picking this holder out.  I did not use the provided screws and drywall anchors, they are pretty flimsy.  I would recommend drilling into a stud or buying anchors that hold more weight."
Home,4.0,LEGO's best Tie Fighter yet!,"This has to be the best incarnation of the Tie Fighter from LEGO. They have refined everything! The minifigures are great. They have amazing details and you get two new figures! You can tell LEGO really payed attention to details. For hardcore LEGO fans you should know you only get three extra pieces. So don't lose your pieces! Also I would like to note. THERE\\""S NO STICKERS!!!! YAY! Because we all know, we hate those things... This thing is very fun to play with and also pretty durable. But the one thing that was disappointing was the play features. You can open the cockpit and there are flick fire missiles. Really LEGO? Again? Since there was no other play features they could have included a firing mechanism, or something! Anyways I got this for 35 bucks. I would wait to buy it until the price goes down."

Home,5.0,Must have deck for all tarot readers! Easy for beginners too,"[[VIDEOID:mo1P49NULXNW38C]]Love this deck! I'd recommend it for beginners and up. It is my new standard. It's a little on the darker side with the images. They are supposed to tap into the subconscious and bring out all the hidden ideas, thoughts and feelings. From my experience it really does that. I wasn't sure if I'd like it at first, but the images really pop,are clear, have wonderful color and are easy to interpret from the cards.<br /><br />There is only the little white book that comes with it, but the author does a great job of describing the arcanas, suites and each card individually as well as giving upright and reverse meanings. It sticks close to rider-waite, but has it's own unique place. They even come with a map for a special spread called the Lunatic spread in the shape of a moon which is now my only spread I use (instead of the Celtic cross). Must have deck for all tarot readers and collectors! None other out there quite like it."
Home,5.0,A birthday gift hit.,I comes with three action figures so it is a complete set for the star wars fan.  My grandson likes everything star wars and everything LEGO so this fits the bill.  Not sure sometimes if I am buying these for my grandson or my son.  My son still has his old LEGOs and some of them are still put together just like he did them yesterday...when in fact they are 20 to 25 years old.  All of my favorite toys were metal cars and trucks and they are long since rusted away.

Home,5.0,just as shown,"This is an inexpensive and very nice all metal set. If you have sat on a plastic barrel pencil you will know the value of a metal leadholder. I do have a concern however. As an artist I generally require archival(non-fading) colors, and as no information is given, I may decide to fill each with a different hardness of standard graphite. In either case the set is great. The sharpeners are obviously intended for fieldwork away from the drawing table lead pointer; since the set can fit in a pocket and has a durable metal case this is somthing I will carry around."
Home,4.0,a great addition to the x-wing fighter,"I purchased the x-wing fighter for my 4.5 year old son and he loved it, but he needed a \\""bad guy\\"", so I grabbed this TIE fighter.<br /><br />The build was very easy.  My son did almost all of it by himself with little direction from me.  It is relatively sturdy and withstands his games quite well.  It is large and is a good match to the x-wing.  In my opinion, the glass of the cockpit is too dark and you can't see the pilot.  Other than that, no complaints."

Home,4.0,I really liked this till battery died....,I got this for Christmas alomst 2 years ago. I used it off and on quite often. Then I wasn't able to use it for about a month and we have no decided it's the battery. It will work for about 30 seconds you then have to shut it off for a minute or two and then can run it for 30 seconds again. A new battery is 20? Really I can get a competelly new one for 27?
Home,1.0,Clock extremely small,The clock on R2D2 is extremely small and the one that projects on the wall is both small and blurry. All in all it is not at all useable as a clock. It would be a great toy for my kids except it is extremely expensive and really doesn't do anything but make noise. Overall I wish I didn't buy it.
Home,5.0,Good quality,Very nice can. Convenient to have trash and recyclables together in a hands-free can. We are able to use regular 13 gallon trash bags from the grocery store - although the sample bags that came with the can did fit better. The lid closes quietly and can easily be made to stay open. Easy to keep clean.
Home,3.0,Disappointed,"This is my 2nd Swivel Sweeper and love it for quick clean ups. But this model did not have the one touch  to empty the dust collector, which was very disappointing."
Home,3.0,Works but a lot of money,"First, what you get doesn't look quite like the photo (only one switch on top) it keeps your iRobot vaccum from going places you don't want it too. Works good at that! It is kind of overpriced for what is is - but hey, better than having your iRobot wandering all over. By the way, the iRobot vaccums are excellent."
Home,1.0,NOT THE SAME AS THE SHOW,"Item was missing Ross, Chandler, and Joey. Also, it's Central Perk, not \\""City Park\\"". This is ridiculous. I hope someone at Lego takes note and fixes their mistakes next time around."
Home,2.0,Enjoy it while it lasts!,"I have purchased this item 3 times now.  Shame on me! When it works it does the job quite well. The problem is it doesn't work for very long.  Either it breaks or the battery dies.  Either way, you spend more money on something that has a life expectancy of something less than 6 months with any type of steady use.  I would actually pay a little more for it if it was built to last. Look elsewhere or plan to replace 2X a year or more."
Home,5.0,Works Great,Needed a small sweeper for those quick touch-ups.<br />This unit fits the bill.  The battery last for 6 uses at about 10 minutes each.<br />I really like how it swivels in any direction and its easy to empty.<br />Use caution with the handle.  Don't press/push too hard.

I received a message from Swivel Sweeper that I had made a derogatory comment concerning the Swivel Sweeper product.  Although this was an error on my part, I feel that I should set the record straight.  I love Swivel Sweeper.  This is the 2nd one I have purchased in the last 6 or 7 years.  My son loved my first one so much he took it home to &#34;try out&#34; the sweeper at his house and never returned it.  So now I have my second one.  Also, I must say that not only is the product wonderful but I was very pleased with the low shipping cost.  If you have declined to buy a Swivel Sweeper due to an erroneous error on my part, please go back and take a second look.  It is worth the time and the price.  I believe you will enjoy yours as much as I have and do enjoy mine.  Thankyou for taking the time to read this review."

This one has more power and even works on very low pile rugs in the kitchen.  It can't be relied upon for heavy duty cleaning, but is nice to get big crumbs off the floor in a hurry.  Our battery charger seems to have some issues, but I have the charger from the old one so that has not been a problem for us."

It does an absolute horrendous job with picking up debris from wooden floor, and especially carpeted floors. Hardly ever picks up hair or cotton fluff at all. Annoying to clean out because the strands that it does pick up end up getting tangled throughout the black spin fibers. The garbage collector is so tiny, it's positively worthless; you might as well be pushing dirt around the floor in circles with a stick. Construction of the product is so flimsy, it's ridiculous. It's like they used cardboard.<br />Battery dies within almost one use. It doesn't help that the charger is barbarically sized and takes up an entire double outlet. Plus the inside of my battery decided to melt a little, which is just fantastic.<br />Never buy this, ever. In fact, never buy anything from those \\""As Seen On TV\\"" annoying ads. They're all liars."
Home,3.0,"Works well so far, but long-term reliability is a question mark","[Important Note on June 11, 2015]<br />My review was originally written for the \\""Lightning EVER 6W LED bulb\\"". But now the Amazon product page shows a different product called \\""ChiChinLighting® 9 Watt LED Bulb\\"". I wish Amazon would stop using this bait-and-switch trick.<br /><br />==== original review follows ====<br /><br />One unusual feature of this [[ASIN:B004BLDD9Y Lighting EVER 6 Watt LED Bulb]] is that it has a white ceramic heat sink. In contrast, the body of a typical LED bulb is made of an aluminum heat sink. The ceramic heat sink may offer the psychological benefit of being safer, since ceramic is electrically non-conductive. But whether it is as effective as aluminum heat sink is questionable. Previously I have tested the [[ASIN:B004YZRNKW Lighting EVER 7 Watt LED Light Bulb]] with similar heat sink design, and it burned out after just two weeks. This 6W version, however, seems to be doing well after one full month of usage.<br /><br />The power consumption of this LED bulb, according to my [[ASIN:B00009MDBU Kill-A-Watt Electricity Usage Monitor]], is 6W as advertised. Note that some other LED bulbs, such as the [[ASIN:B006Y4NPN0 Filite A19 5W Led Light Bulb]], may consume more power than advertised. Its Power Factor is only 0.62, which is not so good. (Lower power factor means more power is wasted in the transmission of energy)<br /><br />In side-by-side comparison with three other LED bulbs, this Lighting Ever 6W LED bulb is smaller in size (see photos I unloaded to 'Customer Images' section). It appears to have the similar brightness as other bulbs in the 6-7 watt, 400-500 lumen range. Its color temperature is slightly more bluish compared to [[ASIN:B005UPUMAI LG LED Bulb]] and  [[ASIN:B002ZBJ25G LWS A19 LED Bulb]], even though they are all called \\""warm white\\"".<br /><br />I must take issue with the manufacturer's claim that this 6W LED bulb is a \\""50W Incandescent Bulb Replacement\\"", because the latter actually generates about 650 lumens of light output. A 400 lumen LED bulb can only be called a \\""40W equivalent\\"" at best. The tricky part is that: the beam from this (and most other) LED bulb is concentrated in the forward direction. So when you look at the bulb from in front, it appears as bright as a 50W incandescent bulb. But when viewed from the side, it becomes much dimmer. That means this bulb works best in a recessed light fixture shinning down, but not good for upward-facing position in a chandelier or floor lamp.<br /><br />Overall, this inexpensive Lighting EVER 6W LED bulb performed reasonably well (so far). But I have to minus one star for its deceptive claim of \\""50W Equivalent\\"".<br /><br />[Update on Jan 2, 2013]<br />I opened the dead Lighting EVER 7W LED bulb, and found a busted polymer capacitor due to overheating. I also discovered that the bulb has no power regulation at all. There are just 60 tiny LEDs driven directly from rectified AC input. A small increase in AC voltage could cause the LED current to increase rapidly and induce a thermal run-away. I will stay away from all Lighting EVER products - for EVER.\\""40W equivalent\\"" at best.

Home,5.0,Lego Star Wars Tie Fighter 9492,Absolute hit with my grandson. Plays with it every day. Many hours of imaginative play.Too bad I gave my son's Star War toys to Good Will ten years ago!
Home,5.0,Love It!,"There are projects for holidays throughout the year, including Father's day and the 4th of July...most craft books that I've seen forget about the summertime holidays. Each holiday has cute, simple things that will be easy for most kids to make with a little adult assistance and there are beautiful projects that are a bit more complicated, but the instructions are easy to follow. I especially like the projects for Mother's day, Father's day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. We made one of the Christmas crafts in my kindergarten - 2nd grade Sunday school class and the kids really liked it.<br />I will definitely be using this book all year long!"
Home,4.0,Just right!,"Ordered this for my boyfriend and I, we are both fans, although I do prefer the original series better! The product is as described and packaged nicely and came on time!"
Home,4.0,Good product,"Easy to build, good model.  Goes great with the Lego X-wing that I bought my son.  I would recommend this Lego model."
Home,4.0,fun set,love this set but I think it is over-priced for what you get. Not much to it but I would discourage anyone from getting it.
Home,5.0,Love it.,"this is the second swivel sweeper I have owned, its a real gem to clean up the kitchen floor, fast over the carpets to pick up little<br />things like cat hair and just shoe traffic.  Got one for christmas for a friend and she loves it."
Home,5.0,I have already completed three projects from this book and have plans for more.,"Some of my projects from this book have already been sent as birthday cards. Also, I'm combining ideas from three different cards shown in the book to design a project of my own."
Home,4.0,Great toy,Built this with my daughter as a puzzle. Great build quality. Not very complex and repetitive but still good Lego quality.
Home,4.0,A favorite,I have 2 units and am purchasing a 3rd as a gift.  My first only lasted 4 years before I was unable to recharge the battery the 2nd is 3 years old and running strong.  I like it better than the Bissel as I am able to get behind the toilet and under more things with the Swivel.
Home,3.0,My first one was better,"Approximately 4 years ago I purchased the cordless swivel sweeper via some late night TV-watching.  I loved it and used it to death.  Literally.  A couple of months ago it died; I dropped it and it wouldn't start again.  I reordered, this time through Amazon.  When I received the sweeper the first thing I noticed was that the color had changed.  The second thing noticed was that the charger didn't work.  Well, OK, I figured, I had kept the battery and charger from the old sweeper, I would use it.  However, I'm still using it --neither the battery nor the charger that came with the new sweeper work.  The sweeper, itself, is great.  I use it to pick up cat litter after I scoop or clean the box, and it also picks up cat hair, crumbs and such with no problem.  I use it on floors and carpet and it works well on both.  It is not used as a vacume, but as a spot sweeper and works wonders for the little jobs for which it is used."
Home,5.0,buy this at walmart !!!,"In the spirit of X-mas , I'm giving you a tip !<br /><br />Walmart has this set for $34 !! Amazon is selling it for $59 ?! what a joke.<br /><br />I bought 3 of these sets, one for my son, my brother and me. every collection needs a few TIE fighters and for $34 @ Walmart, its a must buy. Stop reading and buy it...NOW !!"
Home,5.0,Lego Addict,I got this for a not so young Lego addict in my life.  Are you ever too old for Legos?  Heck no!  Yet another success for Legos.  They keep doing what they do well and they do it right.  If it isn't broken don't fix it.
Home,5.0,adorable,my daughter loves all the lego friends.  and this one is just as adorable as the other ones we have purchased.
Home,5.0,What can you say this is Martha,The most quick go to when having a party.  If you have your theme or not Martha can finish a theme or help you create a theme.  A most have for your craft library
Home,5.0,My Son Loves This,"I got this for my son's fifth birthday and he absolutely loves it! He's clearly under the recommended age range, and i sat with him while he assembled it and he had no problems. On a couple of the steps where you had to do something twice, he did one side while i did the other side so it wouldn't take so long. But he really enjoyed putting this together, i really enjoyed helping, and he loves playing with it!"
Home,5.0,"great product,great price",I like it.Makes sweep up easy.I would recommend this to a friend.Thinking of purchasing a second one for a friend
Home,4.0,Things I miss about the old,"Two things I didn't like about the changes made to the swivel sweeper, it no longer has the magnet to hold the base flat to the handle and the dirt tray is not attached to the sweeper. Everything else is great.sweeper."
Home,1.0,Roomba - Lighthouse - Bla,"I bought this to keep my Roomba out of the kitchen, is not compatable with my 500, I use virtual wall."
Home,5.0,It does what it is supposed to do.,The item works as it should be. Using it with the other 2 virtual lighthouse/wall and they worked well together.
Home,5.0,Gorgeous,"Gorgeous, lovely, sturdy and chic! I highly recommend for any style of decor, not just modern. I have a very French Country/Boho vibe in my apartment and this manages to fit in quite nicely.<br /><br />It's very easy to install and remove- but note to the wise- save the little screwdriver very carefully and clearly label it. Because if you don't have that, then removing the apparatus would be super difficult."
Home,3.0,LEGO City park cafe,"The product we liked but recommending that wearing blue base is complete, because when my daughter was opened to armo each time while joining the other pieces would<br /><br />Best Regards"
Home,5.0,Kinda small,"I like the detail, but it's about 1/2 the size I thought it would be. But my daughter said to give 5 stars."
Home,5.0,"Fun to build together, tougher for the little ones to build solo","I bought this for my five year old and it was great fun to put together.  She did have a few issues when we were putting the &#34;shell&#34; of the cafe together that she needed my help on, but for the most part it was a great experience.  We had a lot of fun with it and will definitely be looking at more LEGO friends sets.<br /><br />Major drawback was that some of the pieces were tough for her little hands to snap together.  We overcame this by building the entire cafe as a team, big fun.<br /><br />What we liked about it: Building the cafe was a fun experience for Daddy/Daughter time, and this was her first &#34;biig kid&#34; LEGO set.<br /><br />It also shipped very quickly arrived 2 days earlier than projected."
Home,4.0,Super cute,I love Eric Carle. After reading this we painted clouds with shaving cream. It was a great sensory experience. Carle's books always lend themselves to great projects and themes.
Home,5.0,Great Product and Fun Build,It was a great simple build. Bags were labeled and the instructions were clear and accurate. All of the pieces were there and it was fun to build.
Home,5.0,Best TIE Fighter yet,I want a couple more of these great models so I can have a fleet battle. The edging around the wings is an inspired piece of design. Coupled with the pieces that make the lines of the hexagon the wings are what makes this model so fine.
Home,5.0,SHINNY MOUSIE,"THIS LITTLE GUY IS SO CUTE.HE SITS ON MY WINDOW SILL IN THE KITCHEN WHERE I CAN SEE HIM PEEKING AROUND A POTTED PLANT. NOT USING HIM AS A KEY HOLDER JUST YET, WILL BE FUN TO HAVE IN MY POCKET TO PULL OUT TO UNLOCK MY FRONT DOOR."
Home,3.0,One came DOA other is AMAZING,"Seriously, if you get one of the ones that work, it will make your room brighter, use less electricity, and look great for filming,"
Home,5.0,Lego Genius,"My daughter loves the new 'girlie' legos.  This project was fun to build, colorful and had all those amazing touches (flowers, etc) that set Lego Friends apart!  So glad she has her 'own' legos now!"
Home,5.0,how can Lego's be less than 5 stars,"Great they finally came around to provide girls with the Friends line. Lots of small special pieces that can be lost but they also help make these friends sets more fun too. For kids younger than the age group noted either help from an Adult or a more experienced Lego builder will be very helpful but the picture guides are well designed to help them. I preffer toys like this that require the kids to think a little, invest some time and effort in the toy, and get exposure on following directions to end up with a creation they can play with."
Home,1.0,It does not live up to its name.,"I have purchased five of these same sweepers and I loved them, but the one I purchased on Amazon is almost worthless.  I am thinking they are now cutting costs and making them in a cheaper way.  The power is very low, maybe they changed the wattage.  Does not work well at all.  So disappointed because I loved these sweepers prior to buying this one."
Home,5.0,Sweeper,I love it. Easy to use. I have two of them and we even have one at work. Very handy.
Home,4.0,Works Just Fine!,I needed something to do quick carpet sweeping in between regular large vac cleaning and it works on hard surfaces as well so this works just fine for my needs...
Home,4.0,Pretty good,I get a little over zealous when ordering and this book is a pretty good craft book but I thought there would be more affordable crafts
Home,5.0,Great book,"This book not only has wonderful craft projects for all the holidays, but it's beautiful to look at as well."
Home,2.0,Sweeper fault,"The sweeper itself works fine.  This is our second one.  But, when emptying the dust cup, the entire cup falls off instead of just swinging open.  You then can pick the dust cup out of your trash.  The other one of these sweepers perfect.  What changed and why??"
Home,5.0,good craft gift,I bought this as a gift and ended up buying one for myself. Good for the crafty person that makes cards or scrapbooks
Home,5.0,This sweeer is an improvemnt design,The new Sweeper design is a very productive unit.and cost effective.  I purchased a battery replacement for the the old units.
Home,5.0,Nice replica,"Was the perfect final touch for my costume last year. It's a little heavy and will pull on thinner materials. However, the manufacturers help remedy this problem by placing two pins on the back rather than one. This also helps keep the badge straight."
Home,2.0,Parts Fell Off,"Sweeper worked O.K. the first few days.  When I put the sweeper over my trash can and opened the door on the bottom to empty sweeper, the unit with the door on the bottom fell off unbeknownest to me.  The next time I used it, there was nothing to hold the dirt as I vacuumed the floors.  Since I didn't know when it fell off, I had no way to send back to manufacturer.  I have had two of these units for 3 years and know how they work.  They work great on hard floors and are quick and easy."
Home,4.0,Cute clock,"This was a gift for my wife, a Starwars fanatic.  She uses it regularly and seems to really enjoy it.  The sounds it makes are fine to wake up to."
Home,5.0,It's about time Legos for girls,My granddaughter who is 9 loves the Friends Legos. She follows the directions and gets it done! Keep making them
Home,5.0,great!!,"Easy to install!  Everyone who sees it, loves it!  It is like a piece of artwork.  Holds 8 bottle of wine."
Home,5.0,Hit the spot as a gift.,Granddaughter really like the Legos and now all I have to do is purchase more for her.<br />Way to go Lego.
Home,5.0,Granddaughter loves it!,Granddaughter says it's a 5-star. Lots of fun. Christmas gift and has already spent hours playing with it. Very colorful & entertaining.
Home,5.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,I have one and love it.  Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She was thrilled as she loves mine.
Home,5.0,Great Toy,"As with all Lego products, you can't go wrong.  If you have a child with strong spatial and reasoning ablilities, it provides endless entertainment.  This particular set is really cute!"
Home,5.0,I recommend this product!,I think it is more good than original swivel sweeper.<br />It has a light in front of the product.<br />Thanks.
Home,5.0,Little cloud is a delight!,As always Eric Carle doesn't disappoint!  This is such an awesomely illustrated book and ties in very well when I teach lessons about clouds.  Just such a great book for my classroom.
Home,3.0,Older model,"This sweeper is the older model.  They have improved it so you dont have to touch the dirt compartment.  Also, the newer model has a bending handle for getting under short cabinets, etc.<br /> Although it is cheaper, I love the newer model Swivel Sweeper much better."
Home,3.0,Not what I thought it would be,"Probly my fault.  We had gizmos in the army... Nothing like these.  Ours were bigger -- and better, frankly.  Wasn't nothing we could not do with our gizmos."
Home,5.0,Perfect!,"My almost-5-year-old wanted \\""girl Legos\\"" for Christmas and this was a hit.  With little help she was able to construct the set using the provided instructions.  After that, the imagination kicked in and I foresee hours of fun ahead."
Home,5.0,Great Legos for Girls,I purchased this set for my preschool class. I am introducing a Lego Education Unit to my class and wanted to really get the girls interested in building. I built it first for they to explore and then will help they build it again. The figures are very cute and appealing to young girls to use their imaginations and try building.
Home,5.0,Awesome Pin!,"I ordered all 4 of these metal Star Trek pins (one for each division of Starfleet).  The Command Insignia came yesterday, and I absolutely love it. i've heard that these are &#34;exact replicas&#34; of the pins used in the 2009 movie, and it is so true!  I like the brushed metal look.  Plus, the box it comes in is usful for displying it when its not on your uniform.  I highly recommend these pins to any Trekkie/Trekker/Whatever you call a Star Trek fan!"
Home,4.0,Get the right one for your model,"I have purchased two Roombas -- a 560 and a 650. The virtual walls/lighthouses are specific to the model that they were made for. If you purchase a lighthouse made for the 560, it will not work with (nor look like) the lighthouse for the 650. Perhaps the manufacturer's description makes it sound like they can work for different models -- but do not be fooled. Make sure you purchase for your specific model."
Home,1.0,Not Happy,"My first swivel sweeper (which was black in color) was just great but this one (red) is terrible...will not hold a charge and the handle is very loose and acts like it will break.....I do not use it anymore, I went and bought a Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo.  I was always a firm believer in the Swivel Sweeper...bought about a total of 5 of the black ones, one for me and each Grandchild got one."
Home,5.0,Classic LEGO,"Great product, as always. My husband loves getting LEGOs still for Christmas, and he's been waiting to have the Tie Fighter... already put together and looking good."
Home,5.0,Who says a trash can cant look good,"Perfect for tight spaces  Its a two in one trash and recycle recepticle.  13 gallon bags fit it so no need to purchase special one  Its is sleek, slim, and great features"
Home,5.0,Great,Great service fast shipping.  I do not have that much to say. It was bought for a gift. My great grand kids liked it.
Home,5.0,So very convenient,"I could not be happier with my Swivel. My mother had the older version for years, loved it so much~ she bought herself 2 this time, and one for me. Neither of us have had a problem with the battery at all. We charged it fully before using it, and did not recharge until the battery was completely dead. Haven't had any issues, I can run it through the whole house a few times before having to recharge. Gets into corners and under furniture with ease, light weight, and more powerful than I expected. This is the perfect solution for in between deep cleaning with my vacuum. I also prefer using this over a broom in my kitchen any day!! No more fly aways and bending over to attempt picking up the pile with a dust pan. Easy to clean too, I just flip it over, use a pair of scissors to cut hair/strings from the brush, and it pulls right off. Worth every penny!"
Home,5.0,For the Lego enthusiast in your life.,I got this for my grandson who is Lego-crazy. He opened it for Chanukkah and quickly put it together as is his style. He has many Legos and this added to his menagerie.
Home,4.0,Finally...Legos for girls,"I think Lego is heavily slanted toward boys and was excited when my daughter (8 yo) told me about Friends.  I think it is a great ideal and she loved the set.<br /><br />What I don't like (and this applies to all current Lego sets) is all the sets are so specialized.  I find it difficult to be creative and build other things with a set.  Once you put together the City Park Cafe, that is pretty much it IMO.<br /><br />Overall it it s typical Lego product - well designed, good quality, over priced"
Home,4.0,Nice Set,A got to have for the Lego Star Wars collection. Cannot go wrong with Lego here! This is a good addition for your collection.
Home,5.0,It's really nice.,My husband is a very happy nerd!<br />The badge has two pins to secure it on with.  I'm sure it won't be lost while wearing.
Home,4.0,Was a gift Good package and fast shipping,Was just a gift and I think it was a great price for such a good quality toy<br /><br />Thank You

Home,5.0,Cute and Fun,"At first my 8-year old daughter was overwhelmed.  I started to build it and as she saw it forming, she got more interested.  The instructions in the book are real simple so once I showed her how to follow-them and she saw it forming into the cafe she really loved it and at the end she was very proud of herself.  A big confidence builder.  This was her first time building legos from a kit and it was a succcess."
Home,5.0,It's NOT a toy!,"I got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it! It's good quality, made out of metal, and looks really nice. But, as any Star Trek nut will tell you, IT'S NOT A TOY! It's a collectible. ;)"
Home,5.0,My 7 year old loved this,"A favorite Christmas present our 7 year old.  We bought her this set as well as one of the smaller ones.  The smaller one she was able to assemble &#34;solo&#34; which gave her confidence to work on this one.  She needed some help with this one, but was mostly able to put it together independently."
Home,5.0,Great LEGO for girls!,The toy of my childhood! Loved it then and still do as I play with my kid.  I love to get these as gifts as you can never go wrong with LEGO! Plus you get a great selection and prices on Amazon! With Prime shipping it is even a bigger winner!
Home,5.0,Great calendar,The photos each month are awesome and the daily squares large enough for our family to write in items we need to keep track of.
Home,5.0,Star Wars,My son loved it! I can't wait to see the pics of this put together!! He was very happy! Thank you
Home,4.0,Convenient,"It does what it is supposed to do, providing convenient cleaning aid for light jobs. It is a fragile tool, so you need to handle it with care. Cleaning the hair that gets tangled is very hard, and thus teh reason for the 4 stars"
Home,5.0,Quick shipping,"The kids really loved it and would recomended to anyone who likes legos, I would certainly buy this item again"
Home,5.0,Love this item,"My son rents a room and needed a small vacuum. We already have one at home, so decided to get him one. It is perfect for his small space."
Home,5.0,cute item,The item was cute it works and I gave it to a foreign exchange student and the instructions were in his language.  Was not planned but worked great.  I think it gave him a touch of home
Home,5.0,Lego,This toy was ideal for my Grand Daughter. She has had much fun role playing with the characters and has proven to help with her motor skills.
Home,5.0,Lego Friends City Park Cafe,Again thanks for fulling your comittment to send the order in time for Christmas. You made a little girl very happy! THanks!
Home,5.0,My 12 year old loves this,He received both the tie fighter and the x-wing for Christmas and wouldn't go to bed until they were both put together.  He loves them.
Home,5.0,Legos,Made Grandson VERY happy! He collects these toys and was very happy to receive it. It arrived in time and in good shape.
Home,5.0,10 yr old Grandson LOVED IT,Challenging and yet he was able to finish it with very little help from Dad.  When done he thought it was amazing.  Best price I found also.
Home,5.0,2nd Christmas gift,This was the second set I gave my granddaughter for Christmas and she was extremely excited over both sets.  Anything that gives her that much pleasure is a winner in my book.
Home,5.0,Good Quality,"This is not some Cheap Plastic. This is quaility Metal and it shows. Great durability and if you read the previous review about putting a piece of cardboard behind this item before putting on your cloths, listen to that reviewer! It works great and I bought the rest of the set. Very happy with this item. The only complaint is the box does not show the Division name clearly since it is written light, but who cares, its the box. The Product is great!"
Home,5.0,My granddaughter loves this!,She was so excited to have her own legos! She is a little younger and does need some assistance in assembling but overall a grat purchase for her (she is 5). Her brother has his legos so great idea to have these female oriented legos!
Home,3.0,R2D2,"its pretty tiny for the price, and it beeps every hour but the time is projected only when u click demo."
Home,4.0,my third one,"I am on my third Swivel Sweeper over the last 9 years.  I tried to go without one for a while, but missed the ease of it.  Totally hated using a broom and dustpan."
Home,4.0,Deluxe Coiling Gizmo- Beadalon Bead,I have only had these products for about three weeks.<br />Works very well just as stated in the advertisement. Have not had time or all the materials to completely test it completely.<br />I am looking forward to work with the Gizmos Coiling tools in the future.
Home,5.0,Cool Xmas Gift!,Cool gift - Scenery & products are quite realistic<br />Note from our daughter: The cupcakes were challenging because the circles don't stay well in the cupcake wrapper.
Home,3.0,Lego name garners high price but product is simplistic and unchallenging!,Very disappointing to see the minimal number of Lego bricks required to put this product together.  The age group for which it is intended will not be challenged and will soon tire of the simplistic construction.  I believe the product is way overpriced and doesn't meet expectations of the cost.
Home,5.0,Awesome Set,"Not a difficult build, but it looks sharp and is very stable.  I had fun with it and enjoy having it on display in my home."
Home,5.0,Fun!,This pin is really nice quality. Heavy duty.  Arrived in excellent shape and the package came quickly.  Great for those special Star Trek occasions.
Home,5.0,Exactly what I needed for waste organizing,"I needed to clean up the look of my trash area in the kitchen since it's adjacent to our main living area and this receptacle was just what I needed.  I love that I can consolidate my recycling and trash into one unit.  Since I have only a 2 person household, we don't generate a lot of trash, so we're using the larger container (black side) for the recycling and smaller container (blue side) for the trash.  Not planning to buy the specialty Simplehuman bags, a standard small trash bag fits fine for our purposes."
Home,3.0,Potentially OK,"I was thrilled that LEGO Friends came out. My daughter loves to build. She did do this and a couple others I got her. She'd do them all if I got them. This was for her 7th birthday. However, I was disappointed. She did them so quickly. They are easy. I feel LEGO dumbed this down for girls is all I can figure. But they didn't lower the price. Maybe purple and pink dyes are costly. The age on this says 6 - 12. I'd be SHOCKED an average 12 year old would care about this. However, this is the third Christmas my daughter - now almost 8 - has done pretty much all by herself the LEGO Christmas-themed sets that say age 12+. This year's did and had 1500 pieces. She was done in two days. No more than 8 hours. Three times asked for help - to locate something. Made one mistake that we could see. Makes me feel that LEGO teamed with the same folks who had t-shirts made that said \\""I'm to pretty to do my homework, so my brother does it for me\\"" or something like that. And from reading reviews of the books that follow these characters put out by DK, superficiality reigns - I hope not reality. But should not frustrate any 7-9 year olds out there. And if you are fine with girls shone only in a certain light and can afford the whole city, that girl will likely be happy."
Home,5.0,Nice,I love my new sweeper. I have purchased similar sweepers but they were not the same quality.  The others did not hold up as well. I'm very pleased.
Home,4.0,Pricey!!!,"Nice garbage container that looks great in the kitchen.  However, the price is a little high.  It should include someone that takes the garbage out for you."
Home,5.0,How can you not get this? The best version of an iconic starfighter!,"Although it might be a bit repetitive in its construction, you will never get bored of this! Swoosh-ability confirmed and good to go!"
Home,5.0,Second time around,"This is my second swivel sweeper.  I flat wore the old one out.  I could not keep house and the price was so reasonable.  I would recommend this for anyone, especially if they, like me, have a light colored kitchen floor."
Home,5.0,My 6 year old really likes this,We got for my 6 year old for Christmas. It was easy for him to put it together. He loves playing with it. He even takes into the bath tub. Great toy!!
Home,5.0,Very cute!,My daughter LOVED this!! She is 8 & put it together all by herself. She now wants all of them! :)
Home,5.0,Another great Eric Carle book,This is a fun story about cloud shapes. My 3 year old grandson and I read this all the time. He never gets tired of it.
Home,2.0,Swivel Sweeper,"I have used this sweeper,  I am not happy since there are no wheels on the bottom of this product.  It is not as smooth as the other Swivel Sweeper that I have purchased. The sweeper does not glide across the carpet as smoothly as my other sweeper.  I would not recommend this for that reason.<br /><br />Thank you"
Home,5.0,Amazing!,"My Daughter is such a 'Trekkie' and she adores Star Trek and she wore it around for a few days. Its good material, and seems to be able to withstand a lot of pressure."
Home,5.0,Adorable set,"My 7 yo daughter just got this set for Christmas. I wasn't a fan of 'girl' Lego, but figured we would give it a try b/c she hasn't wanted to play w many toys lately. It was a hit. She easily put it together and applied the stickers. She likes all the small utensils and accessories, although you have to be careful not to lose them and keep them away from younger siblings."
Home,5.0,"low price , works just like I expected","good price for product, work just like I wanted. would buy another if I needed one great in caMPER BUY"
Home,5.0,Last Olympian,"Great book, my daughter loves Rick Riordan! Why do you insist on wasting my time asking for more words ?"
Home,5.0,love,"My kids love love love this and so do I! Super cute, but falls apart a lot and it's probably better to glue the cafe together."
Home,3.0,Like the Magazine Only in a Book,If you read Martha Stewart's magazine you will know what to expect from this book. Lot's of fun and easy crafts for the holiday's.
Home,5.0,great present,my son collects star wars and this is the cutest thing ever  the time on the ceiling is fun and his sounds for the alarm are great reminders of the movie
Home,5.0,A++,Its Awesome. I love everything about this thing! The recycler is convient and eco friendly. I could not have asked for a better product
Home,2.0,Easily Broken,I dropped mine and the frame immediately broke.  The first one i had seemed to hold up much better.<br /><br />  Wouldn't buy one again.
Home,5.0,Excellant!,"My six year old granddaughter loved putting this together. It was a bit tough for her to do, but with help she did it and loves playing with it."
Home,5.0,so cool!,I am a Tarot collector and I have to say these are some unique cards. Very well done!  A must for a collector!
Home,4.0,Works well.,"Works well when I spill cereal, rice, popcorn, and broken chips which sadly I spilled in the first week of owning this device, but gladly it did the job and did it quicker then my old broom.  The only negative I have seen is that It will sometimes kick a pice of cereal clear across the kitchen but scoops it up quickly after I chased it down."
Home,4.0,Really cute,"We got this for my just turned six-year-old daughter, and she needed A LOT of help with it. Maybe needed a year or two before she was ready..."
Home,1.0,Battery lasted 5 minutes,The product itself is a great one because I was replacing it for one that I have had 3 years.  The battery was charged for 8 hours just as recommended but it will not hold a charge so I must return it.
Home,5.0,Gave as Gift,"This is our 4th Swivel Sweeper. One of our friends requested this as a Christmas gift. We purchased the least expensive model to see how long the rechargeable battery lasts. We've only been able to get 2 years out of them. We noticed they started selling the batteries separately, which is a good thing, because the sweepers themselves last and last and last. You can really get down low under tables and dressers, and this does a decent job of \\""in between vacuuming\\"" pick ups. I recommend this product."
Home,5.0,Original Swivel Sweeper,I had the original one and the motor died.  Then I tried the newer Swivel Sweeper and it was a disaster in that the battery/motor contacts didn't connect correctly and would only work for no more than seven minutes.  I was totally giving up when I looked at Amazon and saw you had the original!!!  It works the way it should and it's great when you have a dog who tracks in everything on his feet.  Just grab the &#34;original Swivel Sweeper&#34; and you're done in a jiffy.  I highly recommend this to all.<br /><br />Absolutely love it but only 'THE ORIGINAL SWIVEL SWEEPER&#34;.  The newer version is nothing more than a piece of junk (crap).
Home,5.0,Love Lego Friends,You can never go wrong purchasing legos for your child. It is so nice that Lego came out with a line for girls because my 6 year old loves to put these together and play with them.
Home,5.0,Good Calendar,I've had a Twilight Calendar every year since the series has come out and I love it. I'm sad this is probably the last calendar I will get of theirs since the series is done.
Home,5.0,very good.,"very good product, it is usefull and I recibed in perfect condition, i recomend for other costumers this item, very good."
Home,4.0,Well built place to stash your trash - and recycling!,"At first glance this seems really expensive for a place to put your trash and recycling, but I think overall I definitely got what I paid for.  This is a well designed item, made of quality materials and I have no doubt it will last for years.<br /><br />I love that the lid quietly closes, that I can keep all the trash and recycling out of sight and that the dog has yet to figure out how to get into the can.  I'm thrilled to no longer have to try and fit an ugly can under the sink!<br /><br />This size seems great for my household of two adults with a separate composter. A larger household might find themselves taking out the trash frequently.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the lid does pop up quite quickly and can wack against your wall - it's not leaving marks or anything but it is pretty exuberant about it.  Stepping lighter fixes that issue but I often don't even bother with the step - I just reach over and flip the lid up with my hand.  I will say the step seems MUCH better engineered than most. Every other step can I've had before this stopped working shortly after purchase. This one seems solidly built.<br /><br />The one thing I don't really like about this can is the liner situation.  I prefer to buy trash bags with some recycled plastic content and while I haven't done extensive research, it doesn't look like the custom liners SimpleHuman sells offer that. They are sturdy bags, and they DO fit into the can better than the other brands of kitchen bags I like to buy but I wish the SimpleHuman brand was a little 'greener'.  I'll probably just keep buying my preferred brand of bags and taking the extra time to tuck the excess edge of the bag down into the can to keep it stashed out of sight.  It's not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, a solid, attractive place to stow your trash and recycling in one secure place."
Home,5.0,SWEEPER,We have had these before and they work great it is used every day we have a wood stove and always there is a little to sweep up
Home,5.0,Lego Friends City Park,Loved it.  Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it also.  I love the fact that this is a toy that my granddaughter can use her imagination with instead of just sitting with her eyes glued to the TV.
Home,4.0,Like original sweeper better than latter,I like this ORIGINAL sweeper because the dust bin is easier to clean and I don't need the elbow joint of the later model.
Home,5.0,Grandaughter loves it,"Didn't know what to get my grandaughter for Xmas, and came upon this book of crafts. She loves anything and everything along this line, and this is a winner. Great ideas, varied and fun!"
Home,5.0,A great purchase,"It performs exactly as advertised, and is a vast improvement over my old one. I do recommend this purchase. I love it."
Home,4.0,It's a gorgeous set,"but I am still giving it four stars because I find it very gender biased to make a Cafe set only for girls. I got this for my son as he loves anything to do with cooking. It's not like only girls run cafes! you need to make a set for boys too. Better still, make a neutral one so both girls and boys can use it."
Home,1.0,Product not same as advertised,Was an earlier model tha that advertised and both the battery and charger were faulty. We have purchased two of these in previoua years and were very pleased with there operation and quality.<br />Looks like they are trying to unload some old models. Requested the replace it with the latest model and was told to throw it away and a credit would be issued.
Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper,"Excellent product for fast clean ups. Main thing, do not over charge and be gentle with it and it can be your best friend. I had one to last 5 years. I would have lasted longer but I left it on the charger for a couple of days. Set a reminder on your phone or I use my stove timer if I'm gonna be home.<br />I love mine !!!"
Home,5.0,princess peel and stick,"I bought these for my daughter, age 4, to decorate her princess room.  They are a nice size and make a wonderful edition to her magical room.  They come with lots of small stickers also, my daughter loves them."
Home,5.0,Great Lego Kit,"Received packed well and in perfect condition.  Nice size finished model, but not overly difficult to complete. A bit on the pricey side but all lego kits are in my opinion.  Good instructions.  Certainly glad I purchased it."
Home,5.0,Lego Gift,"This was a Christmas gift, and from what I understand, it was a huge hit.  My granddaughter built it the day she opened it."
Home,4.0,very handy,"I had the Eureka cordless vac, but every time I went to use it the battery was dead, also I could not keep it in the kitchen where I needed it.  This little sweeper does what I need and stays charged for a long time.  Keep in mind that it does not have suction, it is just a rotary brush sweeper, but it does a great job.  And I love how easy it swivels."
Home,1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My last sweeper broke (the plastic cover when I was cleaning it) and I was anxious to get a new one.  I tried to use this one to pick up hair after giving a haircut, and it just dept spreading the hair around my floor.  So disappointed.  Nothing like my last one.  I would no recommend this."
Home,5.0,"Good quality, and attention to detail.","For the price I knew it was going to be metal, but I expected some minor flaws. Overall it actually is much better than expected. Good machining in the construction, a realistic brushed look, and it has decent heft. It easily fits in with the movie accurate replica's in my collection."
Home,5.0,Excellent,It is actual size and pins on nicely. I have found that it is not intended for easy display moreso for being worn. But I got creative. Plus the box it arrives in also acts as a display.
Home,5.0,what can I say?,Their Legos....what can i say other than I don't like how costly they are. My daughter was very pleased. Glad they finally make them for girls.
Home,5.0,Great!!!,It was a b-day gift for my daughter. She never really was into the Legos until she got this set. Love it!!!
Home,5.0,Not for younger kids,"I know you must be laughing why I buy for my niece that is not 6 years old when the product said so. Well, I thought I could advance my niece but it didnt works. I have to sit and play with her and explain. So personal opinion, this is a GREAT gift but make sure they are old/mature in their thinking before getting them as gift. Lesson learned. LOL!!!"
Home,5.0,BEST GIFT EVER....,"I love my swivel sweeper.  I've bought it for all my friends and they love it too.  When you have tile floors, animals and kitty litter within seconds you can have the floor cleaned up. After charging, I use sweeper until it needs charging.  The charge lasts for many clean ups.  I have bought several &#34;extra&#34; sweepers so no one will be out of a sweeper when it is gives out."
Home,5.0,very good!,"My daughter likes it very much! In fact, I am collecting all the LEGO friends sets for her. Perfect for girls."
Home,5.0,Present for my Nephew,This was a present for my nephew's birthday.  It came on time and he has loved it for hours since.  The instructions are as good as the previous lego sets we have bought him.  I wish my childhood could have had star wars legos.
Home,5.0,Handy for coils,Couple of nice things about this coiling gizmo - it clamps on the work surface and has five different sizes of coiling rods.  It is easy to use.
Home,5.0,Cute,I collect R2s and I like this. A lot of vocalizations. But don't plan on it projecting across a room.
Home,5.0,"Expensive, but worth it; should last a lifetime.","If you have a stainless kitchen, and you're looking for a quality, covered trash can, this is a great choice.  The recycling hopper makes it easy to be a good human, and like another reviewer has said, you can always flip sides and use the big side for recycling and the small side for waste if your needs warrant it.<br /><br />The lid is amazing.  The slow-close is such a welcome addition after almost two years of the slamming lid our previous can had.  And the step is quite a piece of engineering itself; our can sits around a stub wall in our tiny kitchen, technically in the dining nook, we almost always step on the right-side of the step and the can takes the abuse in stride.  With our previous Big-Box no-name cheap stainless can, you could almost feel the stress you were putting on the pedal and linkage when you didn't step just right on it.<br /><br />Another perk over our previous can is that all the linkage and hardware is INSIDE the can.  The old one had a plastic bubble/blister/eyesore behind the lid that housed the hinge and lift assembly.  With the simplehuman its all inside, concealed, protected, and awesome.  The can sits perfectly flush with the wall (save for about 1-1.5&#34; of clearance to keep the lid from banging the wall when opened quickly) and looks great doing it.<br /><br />My wife balked at the price, but after we saw one in person at a local store, then she saw the Recycler model, she was sold as well."
Home,5.0,"If you love lego Star Wars Models, then you need this in your collection","My kids (6 + 8) are new converts to the Star Wars movies. They are also huge fans of Lego, so the various Lego Star Wars sets are hands-down winners in our house. Lego sets have come a long way since my  youth, not only in terms of lots of custom pieces, but also with much clearer instructions and the pieces in numbered bags i.e. assembly in stages. My kids had no issues with this model; usually I just check in occasionally to see that all is going well.<br /><br />Once completed, hours of fun re-enacting space battles."
Home,1.0,Wesco Star Wars R2D2 Projection Alarm Clock,"Fun toy, except it does not keep time accurately.<br /><br />AT ALL.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL from whomever made this toy, extremely disappointing.<br /><br />Don't buy this, get something else instead."
Home,1.0,Don't waste your $,"This clock is a P.O.S.  It is impossible to set the time and alarm, and the display screen is so small and not illuminated.  The only cool thing about it is when the alarm goes off, the time is displayed on the ceiling.  Not brightly, however because in the morning, the room is somewhat light, so you can't really see it.<br /><br />We got this for our son for Christmas, and it is already broken (the arm), and it is early February.<br />Waste of $ in my opinion."
Home,5.0,Good gift.,My grandson was very pleased with this gift.  The set came promptly and was as I expected.  I was pleased with my order.
Home,5.0,Great product,"I purchased this as a christmas gift. It is an excellent purchase. It was well liked, easy to assemble and she was so happy to get it. I guess Lego Friends is the gift for the year! Reasonable price also."
Home,5.0,A must have,"If you love Martha Stewart punches, this is a MUST HAVE!  I bought this particular item through another site as they have them in stock.  Any of the MS Circle Edgers will work with this adapter. Once I read the directions, it was pretty simple to use.  Just make sure that you have the magnetic holder completely in place or it will not line up properly."
Home,5.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,This is an extremely good product; it works as advertised; it works very well; it is very easy to use;
Home,5.0,Great Little Picker-Upper,"I have owned my swivel sweeper for about 3 years now. Yes, 3 years. It just recently started to have some problems holding a charge so I am in the market for either a new battery or a newer sweeper. I'm probably going to get the new sweeper because my handle did break but not because of poor quality but because I dropped it down a flight of stairs. Nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix. I use it a couple times a week to clean debris around the baseboards and under cabinets. My house is much cleaner because this thing is quick and easy to use, so I use it more frequently than having to drag out a vacuum or dust mop. I also know it is not meant o be a vacuum but just a little picker-upper between those big cleanings.  I also want to mention how great it is for doing stairs. This little thing is allot easier to haul around than my dirt devil hand vac with the cord that is so long it wants to trip me. And the only reason I dropped it was because of the cat. Truly a nice machine."
Home,5.0,This Lego good as always,The friends series of Lego's are very good. My kid loves to build this.<br />It is a nice activity to keep kids and adults busy!
Home,5.0,Captain Kirk,"Yea, awesome badges. Simple, cool, well made. I have no complaints whatsoever. They're even the right size so you can just tack it anywhere."
Home,5.0,I want to go to this cafe !!,Lego friends has made these products to appeal to girls and it has done it's job well. My daughter had fun assembling this cafe. It looks real nice. She comes up with vivid stories and plays it with often.
Home,5.0,Little girls delight,A gift for my granddaughter on her birthday and she was delighted to have her own set. Her brother has a ton of them and now she has one of her own
Home,5.0,Huge Hit for Birthday present!,My daughter loved this!  It has different foods that are fun to play with and the colors are awesome.  She put it together right away.
Home,5.0,Great product,Excellent quality and very realistic. It is the same used in the Star Trek 2009 movie. It has two pins and you can use it for real.
Home,5.0,LOVE IT,With all wood floors in a two story three bedroom house this is the best little sweeper I've ever owned. The ease of use is what makes it so great for me with the dog hair on our stairs every day. The rechargeable battery costs as much to replace as buying a new sweeper so now I have TWO. :-)
Home,4.0,S Sweeper,Good product shipped with crummy battrery. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
Home,5.0,Love it!,"It's convenient, easy to use and store away! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it to everyone!"
Home,1.0,Dissatisfied,The first day I used it the plastic covering broke I don't recommend this to anyone I had one before and I did not have a problem with it. But this one doesn't seem as sturdy as the last.
Home,5.0,It a great idea.,The lighthouse is a great idea. Unfortunately it does not work for my Roomba 564. The owner's manual explains that it is compatible for models 570 and higher. Sooo back to the seller it goes.
Home,5.0,Worth buying a new one rather than a battery.,"This is my third one.  I bought one, liked it, so bought another for the other floor.  One of the batteries appeared to be dying, so I bought a new battery ($17) a few months ago.  It was rotten... would go for half speed for about five min.  Remember, I've used these for five years, at least, so know how it should sound.  Rather than buying another battery, I bought the whole unit, and SURPRISE!  It's working well!  I put the new battery in one of the old machines, and it is working at half speed.  My machine is clean, but evidently it is just old, and even a new battery isn't doing it.  I charged the \\""bad\\"" new battery, and put it in the new one, and guess what?  The \\""bad\\"" battery is ok.  Now, I will have to use them up to see if my old charger is also worn out, but I am a happy camper... now have two batteries that are working, and will have to retire my old sweeper.. just worn out, I guess.  I do love these things though... quick pick-up."
Home,2.0,"Great product, but has battery problems that changes your opinion","When I originaly order I recieved 2 sweepers, it was my mistake in the order, one has already been sent back.  I will be sending the other one back if the battery can't be solved.  I have an older version of swivel sweeper, they all have the same problem.  the battery is advertized to run 40 minutes, after multible charges the most the batteries will last is 7 minutes  the two new sweepers acted the same.  I called customer service and they gave a suggestion about the contacts on the charger.  But that did not solve the problem.  Cheap batteries, I still have to send the other one back or get a solution with the battery.  Please contact me about this request.<br /> Trygve Hanson  (602) 616-8267 trygvehanson1@hotmail.com"
Home,4.0,Good performance!,"I've always liked this product; in fact, I've gone through 3 of them.  It's kind of a pain to clean out but worth it to me for cleaning up cat litter on the floor.  I can just grab it and do a quick sweep without dragging out my regular plug-in vacuum.  Battery doesn't last as long as I wish, but it'll do."
Home,2.0,No sharpener,"I received everything in good time.The major complaint I have is that it is promoted as pencils with SHARPENER, and that was the main reason I bought these mechanical pencils. With great disappointment there is no sharpener."
Home,4.0,Great for quick clean-ups,This is a good product for making quick clean-ups.  I happen to have two cats who use a cardboard scratching box and this creates bits of cardboard which end up all over the floor.  The Swivel Sweeper is great for cleaning these up in a hurry.
Home,5.0,Exactly what I was Looking for,"This is the exact star trek pin I was looking for. It was clean, new, and still in the packaging."
Home,5.0,Awesome!,"Ordered two for some friends. The badges look great, perfectly as described, and I LOVE the little boxes they came in. Very happy with this purchase :]"
Home,5.0,Lego Friends,"My daughter love this product,<br />the price was great on this item<br />I have ordered other Lego friends as a collection and I plan on ordering many others"
Home,4.0,"Fun Book, Gorgeous Eye Candy Photos","I love Martha Stewart publications (books and magazines) for their always beautiful photographs. Most of the fun I receive from these products are sitting down and thumbing through the pages just to look at the pictures.<br /><br />This book is no different.<br /><br />It is full of ideas for crafts for New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hannukah, and Christmas. The level of difficulty varies. There are ideas for decorations, party decor, gift wrapping, small handmade gifts, projects appropriate for kids, and more. Many of the ideas can be done just a little bit differently for different occasions (for example, we are not Jewish, but many of the ideas in the Hannukah section can be tweaked to use in other contexts)<br /><br />No, the patterns aren't within the book, but I actually prefer having them as files on the computer. I simply went to the website, downloaded the patterns, and saved them in a file on my computer. It didn't take very long to download all of them, and now they are ready for me to print when I need them. Easy peasy."
Home,5.0,Now I own 4 of these!!,"We have used these for years. Now have one for each floor of 2 homes! Still have the original that i now use in the basement. The Swivel Sweeper has proven effective for picking up crumbs, hair, pet food nuggets, etc from hard surfaces or short pile carpet. Works best on hard surfaces. Periodic cleaning keeps sweeper working well. If you are lazy and never clean the brushes, you will not get the best results. Most folks completely forget there is a small filter to clean. Keep it clean - it is crucial to air flow to allow effective pick up. These do not replace a vacuum, but are great for quick pick ups and reduce the amount of vacuuming you will need to do. Do not use on long shag or other thick carpet if it gets caught or bogs way down When used properly, these are the greatest cleaning tool I have seen. Worth having even just for kitchen use - hard surfaces are the perfect surface for these. I do use them on our short carpets though for surface pickup. Oh - and this $23 price is amazing!!"
Home,5.0,A wonderful tool!,"First I received the punches and I was anxious to try them out. So when the starter kit came I tried it and loved it!!<br />I showed some of my friends (cardmakers and scrapbookers) and they are very enthousiatic! Easy to use. I was a bit sceptic at first, because it looked so easy on the commercial. But it really is that easy!"
Home,5.0,Very happy,We used to have an original but gave it to my son. We tried the newer version but didn't care for it. We absolutely LOVE the good old original one again. Works great!
Home,4.0,Ok product,"Battery dies too fast.<br />sweeps fine, good for quick cleanup.<br />fast shipping, easy to assemble.<br />easy to store. Need to time recharge for 8 hrs, or ruin battery?"
Home,3.0,Very Handy,"I actually thought this was going to be the latest version of the swivel sweeper, but it seems to be identical to the one I already have. Even so, it's a pretty good deal for the cost...I REALLY wanted an updated version though!"
Home,5.0,sister,her shark died not the fish type but the sweeper this one is great for her light weight for stairs
Home,3.0,"OK, I guess","Does the job, accessory was cracked when arrived, kind of loud for such a small sweeper, battery life is what you'd expect,it's alright.  Like I said, does the job, and price is fair."
Home,5.0,LEGO Friends City Park Cafe,My girls who are 7 and 5 love Friends Lego.  The Lego pieces are tiny but fun to build. I like the girly colors.
Home,3.0,Blomus Wall-Mounted Wine Bottle Holder is difficult to install,I gave the Blomus Wall Mounted Wine Bottle holder as a gift this xmas. This person had great difficulty trying to install it and it is still laying on the floor in its box. I am disappointed that I gave a &#34;bum&#34; gift.
Home,5.0,Very Useful.,"I bought this with the hopes I could make a video using it. It looks Kind of scratchy in person, (Just the way it was cut) but looks 10x better on camera anyway. Excellent for videos or cosplay!"
Home,5.0,"The perfect gift for ""the sci-fi geek"" in your family","I bought this for a family member as a gift.  It's a really cool, well made Command badge, and it worked out perfectly!  If you have a sci-fi fan or Trekkie in your family, this will hit the spot... guaranteed!"
Home,5.0,I love it!,"I had the original red model for a few yrs & decided to order the newer model directly from company.  BIG MISTAKE! After waiting over 2 wks & not receiving I called to learn it was on back order w/no idea when it would be avail.  I was supposed to get 2 for about $74. (The \\""buy one get one free, just pay additional s/h,\\"" ad.) I cancelled the order, went to my wonderful Amazon & ordered the new one for a total of $22 w/shipping!  So I could have had the 2 for $44 vs the $74 from the company.  And I had it w/in a few days.  Ok, so the new gray model is basically the same thing & good news is older red battery works in the new grey model.  It does seems to pick up better on difficult surfaces, (indoor/outdoor ribbed mat), but basically the same thing which is a good thing.  It weighs nothing, swivels everywhere, anywhere you want, (this model does not fold in the middle like the red older one), but other than that, the same. I personally love this since it's so easy, great for kitchen & bath floors, & a good quickie on carpeting.  I live alone so not a lot of traffic but I would not be w/out this handy item!  It just does a great job for cheap money & doesn't weigh anything to speak of.  Easy to put together & if you have the older model, the battery will work in the newer model. But BUY it from Amazon!!!"
Home,5.0,Amazing Quality,Ordered the entire set of these and they are all amazing. I was shocked to find such nice replicas at such a low cost. I recommend the purchase to all Trekkies.
Home,5.0,Very good SWEEPER,"I purchased this little sweeper years ago and used it mainly to sweep up around the cat's litter box.  It did the job and then some. But while shopping at Costco one day, I saw the Eureka stick vacuum with a pop out dust buster unit and thought it would be better.  It was considerably more expensive, but I thought it would be more powerful, right?  Wrong.  I gave my little sweeper to my mother-in-law.  She loves it and boy do I miss it!  The stick vacuum doesn't do nearly as good a job picking up stuff as this little sweeper did.  It's heavier and can't get into places the sweeper did.  I'm getting another sweeper.  Like other reviewers said, keep in mind what this is and what it will and will not do.  It's not a deep cleaner; it does a great job on surface cleanups. You will have to empty the tray often and follow directions as far as preserving the battery life of the unit.  It will not replace a vacuum or a mop.  It's made for light weight, in between jobs."
Home,5.0,New one better,I had 2 of the first ones that came out and loved them because I hate to drag out the vacumn just for a few crumbs or a little dirt-these 2 work even better!
Home,4.0,"A great model, but a bit overpriced","I like this set. It’s a good looking model and definitely one of the iconic ships of the Empire, however, for the first time since I’ve been purchasing Star Wars Lego sets, I feel like it wasn’t quite worth the price I paid for it. Compare it to it’s rebel counterpart the X-wing fighter. The Lego X-wing was similarly priced but had more pieces and a much more involved building process. The Tie Fighter however has little more than 400 pieces which doesn‘t seem worth over $50. Also Steps 2 and 3 of the build are the same wing sections (or solar panels or whatever they are called in the SW universe), so you end up having to repeat the same step twice, which is necessary, but repetitious. Also, it might just be me, but I think the finished ship looks too narrow compared to ones seen in the movies.<br /><br />On the plus side, you get a good selection of mini-figs--four in all. There’s no important big name characters here, but I actually like to see more generic Imperial officers and soldiers represented to build the troops, rather than just sticking another Darth Vader in the set. The Tie Fighter pilot looks especially cool.<br /><br />I don’t want to knock the set too much. It really does look good next to the X-wing and it‘s actually pretty big when finished. Also building the cockpit had a bit of a puzzle like quality to it in that you didn’t know how it was going to shape up and fit together until all the pieces are in place, which is something I like about Lego. I just can’t help but feel it could be a bit more moderately priced."
Home,5.0,My daughter loved this calendar!,"My daughter loved this calendar!  It came in a timely manner.  I had originally ordered her a puppy calendar, but it never came (Amazon did give me a refund).  She is enjoying this calendar very much, especially since the movie is coming out today!"
Home,5.0,Its well made,I love this pin and its very well made. I get compliments about it. The silver finish is excellent and it has two cuff link type pins in back to attach it to your clothes and it stays put very nicely. I will buy more products from this company. Im looking for Star Trek type clothes of better quality than the costumes that are out there right now so if anyone knows where and if they can be purchased please let me know. This pin makes me very happy since Im a Trekkie from way back.
Home,2.0,I don't like it,The batteries don't last. When these first came out they were awesome. I will never get another one. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Home,5.0,handy,purchased to replace an older model that was missing some parts<br />lightweight and works great<br />would recommend to anyone for light cleaning
Home,5.0,blomus 65193-29 inch Wall Mounted Wine Bottle Holder,"I love it, get alot of compliments.  It makes my dining room look finished.  The product I purchase from Amazon are just great and I enjoy getting my books for my kindle from Amazon.  Never a problem  Thank you  I rate 5"
Home,4.0,was just as advertised.,"the sweeper does a fine job on hard floors.  we are using it mostly on  our outdoor carpeting, and does fine with small leaves.and twigs,  the emptying is not smooth...maybe a release lever could be installed ."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper,I do like this sweeper.  I had owned a shark previously (that I loved) and it eventually died out on me.  This sweeper picks up just as good - but it not as heavy duty as the shark - but for the price difference that is fine.  The only thing I noticed is that you have to use a 'mopping motion' while going over throw rugs...or it the sweeper head will flip up and out spilling the contents of what it has swept up (because it is soo lightweight). I love having something like this (ESPECIALLY for cat hair!) to tidy up between regular vacuuming with my rainbow.
Home,4.0,GOOD CONCEPT,"I does the job that we wanted it to do, in that it sweeps our hard wood floor prior to wet moping!<br />It does that job easier than using the heavier vacuum cleaner, which is why we bought it.<br />The battery should have a charging indicator light. (I will buy one if it becomes available)<br />The fact that the brushes go in all directions is a major plus.<br />Over all we like the product but it is lightly built and I do not expect to last forever, so I am looking for a more robust unit with the same features, to replace it when it wears out.<br />H Spruit"
Home,5.0,TREMENDOUS!!!,This is the fifth Swivel Sweeper I have bought from Amazon.  Obviously I am delighted with service from Amazon as are the members of my family that I bought the SS for.  Arrived just as you said it would.  No doubt I will buy more SSs as time goes by.
Home,5.0,SWIVEL SWEEPER,I BROKE THE HANDLE OF THE ONE I'VE HAD FOR OVER 5 YEARS.  I LOVE IT AND AM GLAD I COULD ORDER IT.  I MISSED IT!!
Home,5.0,exactly  as advertised,"purchased as a gift for a die-hard-trekkie, this did not disappoint. It would be nice to have it made of a heaver material, maybe metal because the plastic is, I hate to say it, cheesy."
Home,4.0,"revised, worth the money","I've changed my mind.  This device actually works pretty well.  I was appalled by the amount of hair and dirt in the brushes after the first use and assumed that I would need to clean this out after each use.  But it works as is.  The pick/comb is effective at cleaning this out when needed, which for me is about every other month and yes, it's rather disgusting. I only use this sweeper when I see a quick five-minute floor cleaning opportunity.  Otherwise, I use a regular vacuum cleaner for the 45-minute vacuum the entire house project...thus the reason that I only clean the sweeper brushes every other month.  It works better on hardwoods/tile than carpets, but when I recently cleaned up Styrofoam packing debris off my carpet, it did the job."
Home,5.0,Swivel sweeper,We have bought four origional and 3 new ones.......the origional ones seem stronger and last longer....so we bought 3 more origional ones.
Home,5.0,I absolutely love this little Sweeper,This Sweeper is so light and it moves effortlessly around the floor.  It is perfect for when I need to get up dust and cat hair on my laminate floor.  I couldn't be more happy.
Home,5.0,One of our favorite lego friends sets,My 10 year old daughter likes the hamburger but the pieces easily get lost if you take it apart. This set is good for all of your lego friends to hang out in.<br /><br />The broom is good for cleanup and you can clean it off in the sink. You can make smoothies in the smoothie dispenser. There are also some more little pieces.<br /><br />It would be better if there were more food and more little seats for your lego friends.
Home,5.0,Fun!,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. We both loved it! Now this badge sits in his collection of Star Trek items. Nice quality.
Home,5.0,Better Than Original,"This sweeper, is a upgrade to the Original, seen on TV, swivel sweeper. Very good for a spill, no liquid, but many other things, it is quick to grab and take care of the mess...."
Home,5.0,Fun block for my 6-year old,"It is a perfect gift for 6-year old girl. My daughter had fun with it for several hours. Plus, when we introduce other character from other Lego series, such as City, it is more fun and like community social."
Home,5.0,Great detailed instructions,"I love the detailed instructions and all the different ideas, it is a great book for any paper crafter in my eyes."
Home,5.0,Good product,"I'm using this for the past 1 year, this unit is working fine without any issue. Swivel sweeper is very comfortable for quick cleaning. You can't rule out the vacuum machine, but pulling out the vacuum from storage and repacking it back is a big process for me. I'm using the Swivel Sweeper to clean any visible dirt in my carpet and kitchen flooring. Till date I didn't face any problem with battery or the pole. Swivel Sweeper can't be a replacement for your vacuum machine, but it helps you a lot for quick cleaning and to keep the house always neat."
Home,1.0,Out-of-box defective,"I bought two virtual lighthouses, when I tried use they were defective. Contacting iRobot for replace took a long time in a very slow customer reply. Very time iRobot look for excuses to not do that is very simple they sold a defective product they need just replace, sound so easy the problem to me I don't understand the matter. The main problem was that I bought but travel abroad and was writing from an outside country. Finally they agree in replace, but I need post inside the country ok that is reasonable but impossible to me in that moment. In the very moment that I return I tried again make the return and now for my great surprise, instead of just replace that would be fair and easy I receive a reply (again a very slow reply from custom service) inform that I was beyond replacement period.<br />Worth to mention that:<br /><br />- Companies that show respect for the customer usually doesn't make hard replace broken products actually usually they do a RECALL when they know that is a quality control problem;<br /><br />- This problem an epic fail of a product out of the box and very restrict rules to fix their qualities problems should make every one thing about, maybe neato robotics is an opnion for product that simply doesn't work and companies that abandon you; (A fail out-of-the-box make you feel a foo, and a lack of support make you be sure that the companies foolish you. Think about Does you want be foolish? Maybe avoid buy from iRobot is wise)<br /><br />- Although I understand that iRobot will say simply that I was beyond the replacement period. Everyone should judge for yourselves. I contact in the period, they knew that was a batch with problems, sent a broken item was their entire responsibility, they never mention that was a period to send and i made all things as soon as possible to me, despite all this iRobot stick to his police."

Home,5.0,give rating on purchase,"I have always been pleased using Amazo for<br />all my purchases. Their policy is fair on any<br />tractions and their employees via phone or email have always been helpful,courteous,and knowedgeable."
Home,3.0,stale battery,My battery keeps not working. Just opened box two days ago used sweeper once. Charged battery couldnt get it to run! So i kept lifting it up and it popped on. Then next day  it needed to be charged. It was kept in OFF position. I think my battery had been used or weak from the beginning. So its useless unless i get another battery sent to me!!!!! (Or Im returning the sweeper for a refund.)
Home,4.0,nice item,This works very well for light cleaning and especially helpful for an elderly person to use.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for quick pick up.
Home,4.0,swivel sweeper,this sweeper works just fine for light material. it sure beats that back breaking broom. it makes for a quick and easy clean-up.
Home,4.0,Great little sweeper,"I have had one since they first came out years ago. This picks up hair, dirt, and debris very well from smooth floors. This is not a vacuum and not really made for carpets. I do use it on the carpet in my kitchen that has very low knap and it works great.<br /><br />I was disappointed that this didn't have the one touch empty tray. In order to empty you have to push the tabs on top to get the tray to release and then empty it yourself. This little inconvenience is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />Also, in order to extend battery life, when not using the sweeper take the battery out or it will drain it very quickly.<br />Mostly I am very pleased, it's nicer to pull this out of the closet than lug out the big vacuum."
Home,4.0,Great Tie Lego Model,"I've been waiting for an updated version of all the basic Tie fighters, minus the silly Tie Crawler and the droid brain TIE/d, which has rectangular wings. My son and I have every Tie thus produced and I was stoked to see a much sleeker version of the TIE/LN or &#34;standard&#34; Tie come out to replace the older black with blue accent models. I'm hoping they redo the Tie Interceptor. The older sets are worth more to collectors, but since I have no intention of ever selling any of our massive collection, I am happy to see new and better models come out. Anyway, #9492 is a great model and we only like the Defender (#8087) better, out of all our Tie collection. It is also nice that the set comes with four minifigs, three of them fairly uncommon. I feel it was a good value and we bought a wing of three sets. Highly recommended."
Home,5.0,Love it!,"Easy to install, very sturdy, very stylish. I get lots of great compliments on it. I may buy another one to stack them on top of each other or side by side."
Home,4.0,very handy little sweeper,I have been using this little sweeper for about one year and I use it everyday.  I have been very satisfied with the performance of the little guy and for the price I paid for it has been worth it.  Now in the past week I have the problem of the battery not holding a charge and I do believe that is my own fault.  I have left the battery in the charger for many hours beyond the 8 max they recommend and I am sure I killed the battery.  So I am going to order this $16.00 replacement sweeper and throw out the old one.  I bought the original in Ross for 19.99 so the replacement is cheaper to buy then a battery.  Well that's my story .
Home,5.0,I Love It,Exceeded my expectations as per quality and price. Just wished the battery lasted longer between charges. Otherwise it is great.
Home,5.0,Great Little Sweeper!,Love it! Very good value for the money. I keep this in my kitchen for quick clean ups. Works great and I don't have to ge the big vac out! Thank you!
Home,4.0,Much smaller & less durable than expected,"I purchased this for $50 which is much higher than i'd like for such a set. It's intricate so my little ones struggled to put it together correctly.  If you buy this, you're likely going to need to help out a little if it's for a child at the younger end of their 8-14 age range. The set seems to fall apart easily when we attempt to pick it up, fly it, move it, etc, as the center cockpit isn't as secure as it should be. Plus, there were a couple of pieces missing from my set. I was surprised that it was so small, considering it was $50. But the minifigures are fantastic and made the cost of the set more palatable.<br /><br />As far as sets go, i was just okay with this one. If you can score it for around $35-$39, that's probably a more fair price. If you hit $40, you've overpaid.<br /><br />Hope that helps."
Home,2.0,Disappointed,I bought thinking it was like the one on TV which you could remove the brushes to clean easy but theses don't come off its the Max that does that not this one
Home,5.0,Excellent,"Very easy to install, fast shipping<br /><br />wife loved it, would recommend to friends or family.<br /><br />highlight of the room it is in.!"
Home,4.0,Lovin' it!,Love it for fast clean ups.  Love it for picking up those pesty Asian Beetles and Boxelder bugs that find their way into your home and porches in the fall.  Does better than a broom and dustpan.  :)
Home,4.0,Great sweeper.,"Love the sweeper. But...the battery charger doesn't work. Fortunately, had an old battery charger. This is second sweeper I've had."
Home,4.0,Older model that works well,"The sweeper delivered was an older model, not the model I expected. This was replacing a newer model with a swivel dust bin that had broken and the batteries  had given out. The sweeper works well and the price was right."
Home,3.0,Rechargable battery issue,"This is our third Swivel Sweeper and have loved it in the past. There is no change in the construction and does work well, however, the quality of the battery has deteriorated. It does not hold a charge like the previous ones we have had. You have to recharge it almost daily as in the past it was about once a week. Definately will not buy another."
Home,1.0,cordless swivel sweeper,The charger is not working....the red light does not go on...older model because it doesn't have the magnetic piece so that when you hang it up...it's upright.  upright have had two before this and wanted . One for second floor of my home.<br /><br />It is completely useless because the battery cannot be charged.  charged.  Sorry I spent the money
Home,5.0,Try it your back will like it,chose this rating as this product is great.  One is for the litter trail the cats leave constantly.  The other is for the kitchen for rugs and over the tile on floor.  Price of a lunch out or dinner and they last almost a year.
Home,5.0,What's not to like?????,"Lego. Tie Fighter. Do I really need to say anything else here??? It's a pretty simple design, but still loads of fun to make again and again. There's also quite a bit of repetition in the building of it, but seriously who cares. The whole point is to make it so you can run around your house with it and make Tie Fighter sound effects, right??? And it's very good for that! Fly on my fellow Star Wars nerds!"
Home,4.0,Work fine and good for older people.,Work great I don't have the strength to lug the vac like I used to so this light weight swepper do the job for me.

I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT HAS A RECHARGABLE BATTERY, I USE IT ALL OVER THE HOUSE!"
Home,3.0,"The finish could be a bit better, even for the price...","I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and I've been a bit disappointed by the finish of  the badge. She was still happy, and it does look good if you don't look on the details, but one could tend to expect more from a licensed product.<br /><br />And I'm not convinced by the double pin attach. A brooch type attach would have looked better, have made it look a bit more &#34;real&#34; and be more secure if equipped with a security fastener. But I'm just nitpicking on this matter."
Home,4.0,Swivel Sweeper,Excellent product.  Not good for carpets but it works great for picking up cat litter from hard wood floors.  Wish the batteries would last longer than about a year.
Home,5.0,Most innovative decorative circle edge punch yet!,"I had been on the fence about this punch for some time.  But when I came across a 50% off coupon I bought it at Michaels.  Sorry, Amazon...  BUT some of the punches aren't available in the stores, so I went back to Amazon and purchased a punch I really liked, so I'm good again, grin.<br /><br />For those of you who don't really know what you can do with these punches aside punching out doilies in all sizes, I invite you to visit my blog, [..] to see what I have done with this punch.  The possibilities really are, well, maybe not quite endless, but definitely several-fold.<br /><br />True, the instructions are a bit bare bones, but then again, the punch really is simple to use:<br />1.  open the punch by pulling it out of the plastic sleeve that covers the bottom.  See that cutting plate wedged inside?  Take it out, and put it in the machine's moving tray smooth side up.<br />2.  Decide upon what size circle you want to cut out.  Select that size at the rounded edge of the tool (see that lever that can move?  Say you want an 8\\"" circle, so you slide it on 8), then also move the cartridge (punch) up to the 8\\"" mark.  Do not go in between, it won't work.  You need to work with full inches only.<br />3.  Next, you find the center of a piece of paper larger than 8\\"" diameter (can be an 8.5\\"" x 11\\"", that's fine) and put that center underneath the cross hairs of the \\""knob\\"" on the left side of the punch, making sure that both of the \\""knob's\\"" magnets connect with their counterparts underneath for a secure hold.  Then you place the punch head on top of the paper (which extends over the bottom cutting plate, okay?) and hear the magnets connect as you place it down.  Punch, lift off the punch, and rotate the paper with the knob one notch in either direction.  Replace the punch and punch down, lift off, turn, place punch, punch down, and so on.  It sounds a little labor extensive, and it takes quite a few punches to get around the entire paper, but before long you get the hang of it and then it goes easy.  If you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.  It may not have aligned perfectly before.<br /><br />In time, as your punch feels a bit \\""sticky\\"", use wax or freezer paper and punch through that a few times.  That lubricates the punch and eliminates the \\""stickiness.  If you encounter areas that aren't punched cleanly, try punching through aluminum foil a few times to sharpen the punch again.<br /><br />If you still have trouble understanding how this punch works, please feel free to contact me via my blog and I will try to help you.  Note:  I am not affiliated with Martha Stewart in any way, not exactly a fan of her ever expanding \\""empire\\"", but I do acknowledge when an item is well made and thought out.you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.

Home,5.0,My granddaughter (Sierra) ask me for this.,"My granddaughter ask me for this. When I gave it to her, she was happy and had to put it together right away. I was reading the instruction book and noticed that Sierra had it put together already. I ask how she could do that. She said, &#34; I remembered how to from doing it at dad's house.&#34; Her dad had gotten her this set and it was at his house. I'd give $200. to have her memory! lol"
Home,1.0,Okay,"This works alright, not the best. Its good for a quick pick up of dirt but does not do a througho job like a real vacuum does."
Home,3.0,I DON'T KNOW,"I purchased this item in December,2012, because my friend has one and enjoys it a lot.  Here it is the 3rd of April, 2013, and the gears are stripped in my sweeper.  It only has a 90 day warranty.  So I have a nice swivel sweeper that I did like using but now it is broken."

Home,5.0,Great for hard floors!,"The sweeper cleans up on all sides so it can go sideways, backwards, and still pick up. It is easy to clean and take apart if you need to untangle threads from the bristles. We have a tile floor and would not recommend this for carpet."
Home,1.0,didnt work for me,never worked frm day one -- couldnt get it to charge and or work.  i wish i had not ordered :(
Home,5.0,"Fun, Easy, and Ready to Strafe Rebel Scum","This is the first LEGO set I have purchased and assembled in a good many years. So, I decided that with some extra income I should take the dive and finally put one together. I chose the TIE Fighter because it seemed fairly priced for what the set contained and I'm a bit of a sucker for the fighter itself (I'd prefer it be a TIE Interceptor, but I won't be picky).<br /><br />The instruction booklet was easy to read, contained large, helpful illustrations, and was just plain nicely put together. I seem to remember booklets being a lot more vague and smaller back in the day. The pieces themselves were all there (In fact, I had a few extra small bits) and fit together exactly as intended.<br /><br />I think this probably took me somewhere around an hour and a half, perhaps two hours to build, and that was without any particular focus being put into it since I wanted to savor the build. The end result is a good size and displays very nicely. I personally like to pretend it is sitting in the hanger being serviced by the pilot and astromech while the guard guards and the officer supervises.<br /><br />Overall, it was a spectacular bit of fun and I'd recommend the set to others."
Home,4.0,it works fine i am satisfied,i have purchased an additional sweeper and sent as a gift i recomend this item to my friends and family
Home,4.0,Cordless swivel sweeper original model,"It is very light, but strong enough to do the job on my laminate floor in my mid-size family room.  I do prefer this original model over the recent model for its sturdiness.  Do not charge over 8 hours.  Charger does not have indicator light on nor automatically shut off.  This is a very good product that we use daily for our family room."
Home,1.0,DO NOT BE CONNED,This model was not the one I wanted. I wanted the one with the brushes that can be removed for easy cleaning &#34;as shown on TV&#34;.<br />The adds do not say that there is a &#34;Swivel Sweeper&#34; and a new &#34;Swivel Sweeper&#34; with the removable brushes. Don't be conned by the adds that leave out this important fact.
Home,5.0,Perfect Birthday Gift,"I purchased this badge for a friend's birthday- and he loves it. It's the perfect size, and isn't too heavy, so it can be worn perfectly on a lapel without wrinkling or weighing down the fabric. My friend wears it all the time at work, and he's extremely pleased, as am I.<br /><br />Fantastic product- would definitely recommend as a birthday or holiday gift for any Trekkie."
Home,5.0,Return,"I loved this product, but the battery would not charge properly.  I had to return item.  It was painless and prompt.  My money was returned promptly.  Give me a sweeper though.  Not easy to get the battery replaced."
Home,1.0,I regret using it with every use,"Don't believe the hype you see on TV. I did and I regret it with each use. I have a vacuum cleaner, but it's not always needed to pick up lint or a few scards of paper. You can spend the afternoon trying to pick up lint, going over the same lint over and over; only to have to pick it up again somewhere else. Alot of times I wind up picking it up with my hand. I have had it for about a year and have also found the handle not able to handle such light duty. I've had to replace the handle and a battery. Don't ask me \\""Y\\"". Just say \\""I'm A FOOL for punishment. The new battery most have been used because it has already gone dead after a few months. That's why I'm here at Amazon getting reviews BEFORE I BUY. To anyone who buys one, I say \\"" See ya later sucka\\"""

Home,1.0,Did not work,"I ordered this virtual wall because I thought I needed a third one to make it easier to control where our Roomba was going while it cleaned the floor.  It was delivered on time but, when batteries were put in it didn't work.  I changed the batteries several times to be sure it wasn't the batteries but that didn't work.  It was a defective virtual wall.  I wanted to send it back and get a replacement but, the rules for this purchase were I had to send it back, get a refund, then reorder.<br />I have nothing agains't Roomba.  I am rating this product based on it's performance.  It didn't perform so, it gets one star."

Home,5.0,Great Pick up!!,I love this sweeper.. it is fantastic for a quick pick up on hard wood floors.  I've speant lots of money trying to find something that would work on hardwoods.  They are all expensive and they do NOT pick up on hardwoods.  This sweeper is AWESOME!!  It does just what is advertised AND I got it for only 20 dollars!!  This is my second sweeper of the same brand same model.  The first one broke after about 2 1/2 years of daily use.. so I didn't hesitate to replace it.  Love it!!!
Home,2.0,Low capacity,I used it to sweep dry rabbit poop off the carpet but it has a very low collection capacity so I had to constantly empty it and get my hands dirty.

Home,5.0,More then I had hoped for,This is a great piece.  I collect Legos and this one was pretty impressive to me.  Easy to assemble and had all the pieces.  Arrived in a timely manor so no complaints here.
Home,2.0,This is a terrible product,"I should have listened to the people that said that it would not hold a charge but above and beyond the battery life, this sweeper doesn't pick up simple things like little pieces of paper or lint. I have tried to use it several times and every time I have been disappointed. Please save your money!"
Home,4.0,"My 6 year old loves these sets, this was the second one we got her.","the downside would be that it didn't take my daughter very long to out this set together.  the upside is that it is a very cute playset and she has been playing with it for hours since completing it.  It has alot of cute details, she is already asking for more!"
Home,3.0,Sold ME An Older Model,"I bought this for $25 i should have realized there was a catch.  This is an old machine at least 5 years old. It has a lousy way of  emtying dust tray. How do I know? Ive bought 5-6 of these over the years.. They last about a year, if you are lucky.. Buyer beware  the ones that are black are old machines, the red ones have a better way to dump the tray"
Home,2.0,Sweeper is OK but the battery supplied was terrible,The Battery for the Swivel Sweeper lost it charge very quickly.  This continues to happen after many uses after charging.
Home,5.0,excellent,"I have owned Swivel Sweepers ever since they have been on the market. I could not live without owning one. It's great the kitchen and bathroom floors and berber carpet. I am not the type of woman that drags her vacuum cleaner out once a week. The swifter will pick up all the dirt and crumbs on the kitchen floor and messes in the bathroom also. I run mine whenever need be, especially once a week before I mop the kitchen and bathroom floors, it does a better job on hard floors than my vacuum does.<br />Just follow the directions for the charging the battery and I use a metal thread puller to clean the bristles, which works great. Once you've owned a Swivel Sweeper you can't imagine your life without one."
Home,4.0,Sweeper is great for quick clean-up,Like this sweeper. Works well on floors but not so well on carpet. Great for quick clean up.  Would buy this product again & recommend it.
Home,1.0,Would give it a zero star if I could,"At first I loved it, bought two even from the tv ad, buy one get one free. What a waste. It worked well for about the first 20 times, then the battery would die before I even ran it 4 or 5 minutes. I bought a replacement battery from Amazon and it didnt work AT ALL. Chocked it up to live and learn. Also, using it on carpet would clog up the bristles and you have to dig it all out. NOT EASY. If you're planning on using it on a tile floor, the battery would probably work longer, but it doesnt clean the edges, you would still have to break out a broom."
Home,5.0,Deluxe Coiling Gizmo,I've just recently received this item and I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet. What I like about it so far is that it has an easy set up and can be anchored to my workbench and the instructions on the back of the box seem very easy to follow. I believe I will be very pleased with this item and would recommend it to others.
Home,2.0,swivel sweeper original,"It runs for just a little bit and then stops, it's got a full charge and it's not on anything that this should happen The swivel sweeper G2 I bought the first time works great, but the original I bought the second time is not worth anything."
Home,4.0,Sweeper great - batteries are not!,This is my second sweeper...I really love it but am very disappointed the the technology  that developed this machine hasn't been able to come up with a better battery.  The quality control on the batteries is very much below par.  Even my brand new ones frequently do not work well.  The replacement batteries are not much better and cost almost as much as the sweeper.  Swivel Sweeper needs to get on the ball with this otherwise my next sweeper  my come from someplace else.
Home,5.0,Good toy,Bought for my four year old niece...she loves it!  Nice buy....glad I went with this Lego set.  Hope others like it.
Home,5.0,Sweeper,I actually love this.  It does more than just push dirt around. Go over the floor once and you are done.  It holds a charge for me to use it on my kitchen and bathroom floor serveral time before I have to charge it and it seems to charge quickly.
Home,5.0,"wished it worked ,  but sending replacement !!!!!!!","the New Battery does NOT hold a charge!!!!! Runs good for about 5 minutes then just dies.  I have owned one of these for about 4 years and I have just worn it out, so I purchased this one and it runs down very quickly.  The old one was awesome !!!!!! Contacted Amazon cust. service, they solved the problem.  Company sending out a whole new unit with no return!!!!  That's service !!  Do not be afraid to purchase from this Company"
Home,5.0,Works great,This is a fast and easy way to spot clean between regular cleanings. I have one for the litter box room and one for the kitchen and dinning room.
Home,5.0,Convenient and well-designed,"I bought this a couple months ago for my apartment kitchen and it has been working great. I like the slow closing lid so after I throw something out, I don't have to worry about the trash anymore. When changing trash bags, you just have to lift the compartment up a bit and it stays there, about 3-4 inches higher than the rim of the stainless steal outside compartment. I don't have to take the inside out or try to hold it up to put in another trash bag. I don't know about you but I found this pretty amazing. The recycling bin is a bit narrow so if you just throw bottles in randomly, you'll run out of room quickly. However, it is tall enough to not be an issue often.<br /><br />My kitchen is rectangular and relatively narrow and small so I was worried about how bulky this would be. However, it fits perfectly along the narrow side wall and doesn't protrude annoyingly. You can also keep the lid open with the small switch on the side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to manage<br />Convenient design during use and while dumping.<br />Great for narrow kitchens<br /><br />Cons:<br />Narrow recycling.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great convenient design that's good for apartments with a couple of people. It might be a bit small for the waste generation from large families though."
Home,5.0,Great for Girls and Boys!,"First of all, I have to say I don't agree with people who think these are a frail attempt for Lego to address gender biasing claims. These are great Lego's and different from most stuff that they have released previously. I think it is a great idea!<br /><br />My daughter got this set as a gift and she built it by herself for the first time (she is 7). Now that it is built, she uses it occasionally but my son (who is 5) really likes to play with this set as well!<br /><br />We like playing out military/police/counterTerrorism scenarios with our Legos. With this set, I can finally teach him the importance of soft targets as a method of progression with a guerrilla based campaign fought by an under equipped and under funded army. We set up our artillery on the coffee table and put \\""Outpost Screwed\\"" (That's what we named it) out in the middle of the wood floor. If our artillery bombardment doesn't do the trick, we go in with our Armored Vehicles and supply .50 fire from a few hundred yards out. If all else fails (and if often does), we send in the foot soldiers to pull those cute little Lego Friends out by their boots and string 'em up on the Prince of Persia set we got 2 Christmases ago.<br /><br />The fun never ends in our house! I highly recommend this product."
Home,4.0,Broom Reveiw,Great product. I have a two year old and before this product I was using the old fashion broom all day. But with the cordless sweeper it eliminates the old fashion broom and dust pan. Great invention I'm ordering one for my mom and sister.
Home,5.0,Awesome and easy to install,This thing is so awesome. The look of it hanging on my wall is fantastic. Super easy to I stall and all you need is a brain to I stall this. If a man can't figure out how to install this then he needs to look in the mirror. Supplied hardware is fine when installed straight on drywall. Holds to wall with three screws mounting points. Wine bottles are held on at a slight angle and looks cool.
Home,5.0,Lego Star Wars TIE Fighter 9492,This is a fun toy that comes with 4 characters and is bigger than I thought it was going to be. It is bigger than the older TIE Fighters. I recommend this to any hardcore Lego Star Wars fan . I gave it 5 stars because it seems like better Lego product than the past products.
Home,5.0,cordless sweeper,"this particular one works well on hard surfaces, but not so good on rugs and carpets, it has a tendendy<br />to grasp threads and gets stuck instantly.  the battery needs to be charged after about 5 minutes of use<br />but otherwise works well"
Home,5.0,cordless swivel sweeper,Cordless swivel<br />works super love the flexability picks up everything and so lite and easy to handle<br />would recommend it to anyone will probably buy 1 or 2 more for the house and camper
Home,3.0,You get what you pay for,"I liked my original sweeper better than this one.  But this one will do for now, it is okay too."
Home,5.0,very useful,helps to keep the unit contained in a single area and not rome all over the entire house all the time
Home,4.0,Quick clean up!,Great sweeper for a quick clean-up. We use this product in our RV because often grass and other things are tracked in onto our carpet. The Swivel Sweeper is fast and easy way to remove this debris.
Home,5.0,GREAT GIFT,My 6 year old granddaughter loved this gift.  I gave it to her today and she couldn't wait to open the box and start putting it together.<br /><br />I would recommend Lego Friends City Park Café 3061.
Home,5.0,Better Than The Old Style,I love this sweeper. It really does a good job. I am using it on my carpet for spot cleaning and also on my kitchen floor. I wanted and old style one but this one is battery operated and the battery gets recharged. It's great. You are going to love it.
Home,5.0,Runs only 2 to 3 minuts on a charge,"We have two swivel sweepers.  The first worked well so we purchased a second and an additional battery and charger.<br /><br />The second runs well for about 2 minuts then stops.  If I recharge the new battery it again works well for about 2 minutes.  I havn't decided wheather it is the batteery, charger or the sweeper.<br />Richard W. Rose"
Home,5.0,Love these pencils!,"I'm not an artist, but my mother is and she recommended this brand. These pencils are GREAT for note taking. The sharpener is screwed into the top of the pencil, which makes getting a nice point really simple. The leads are nice and thick, so they never snap. My mom wants her own set."
Home,5.0,Best sweeper for the lowet price!!!,Great product and extremely easy to use. No cords and picks up everything on carpets and bare floor<br />Thank you
Home,4.0,Cool and gorgeus,"Is a good purchase, is large enough and detailed, if you're a Star Wars fan this is an obligatory addition to your collection"
Home,5.0,Awesome,This wine holder is so nice and better than I expected.  I had so many compliments on the wine holder.  Best of all I could even figure to mount it on the wall even though the instructions were in German.  LOL
Home,5.0,Beautiful and original,The work here is incredible; very original and mind-blowing. I enjoyed the tour around the world in so many different versions and styles of art. It really makes your mind race as an artist to find new and interesting ways to draw the world around you in constant motion.
Home,5.0,How much I like the punch,I think it is awesome. I made a bunch of dollies for my sister. She loved them. I will use it a lot in making cards.
Home,5.0,My grandson broke handle off one I had I missed it terrible till I got this one today.,I use cordless swivel sweeper every day and I can't stand it when  don.t have one.  I told several people about it and several has purchased them.
Home,3.0,Returned,"It may be a decent product, but I really wanted the Shark swivel sweeper which I love. Though I can make no real recommendation I can simply say don't settle if you want another brand."
Home,5.0,Best money I ever spent!,"This was actually a replacement for the one I purchased years ago that finally gave up the ghost.  It is so handy to grab this and run it over my carpet instead of dragging out my heavy, cumbersome tank vacuum.  It really picks up everything on the surface.  You will be amazed!"
Home,4.0,Nice and Quick,Having kids that make messes and a dust buster that died after 10 second of being turned on...this is a WONDERFUL invention!
Home,4.0,What a shocker!,It's a great sweeper which I bought for use in our caravan.  Unfortunately with it being American it has a different electricity voltage to Australia so I had to buy a different charger.
Home,3.0,"Months later I am finally well enough to write my review, so here goes...","This came beautifully packaged, is real metal and looks fantastic.  But I only got to wear it twice before one of the clasps on the back pins somehow wouldn't clasp anymore.  I am saddened that I cannot wear this and only have it sitting around as a keepsake.  I am also, I am sure, too late to try and get an exchange as I have had chronic illness and spent little time online and also taking care of anything other than the bare necessities that needed taking care of.  I have no idea where to find those little round squeeze-clasps that go in back either.  Perhaps if I could locate one, I could wear this once more."
Home,4.0,Looks very nice,"Only thing I didn't care for was with the weight of it and the way that it pins to the shirt, it does not stay nice and stiff, but flops a bit. Would be better if the mounting was different (Like magnets instead of pins)"
Home,5.0,Great little cleaner,I use it for small pick up to whole rooms. My first one lasted 10 years. Hope this one will to.
Home,5.0,LOVES IT,"Adds to her lego collections, LOVES Her GIRLIE legos!!!  Now the kids love coming to our house for play dates!."
Home,3.0,It works but not as powerful as I expected,It picks up dirt and crumbs alright but glides right over anything flat like scraps of paper. It is not very powerful<br /><br />It works Ok but I was disappointed.
Home,4.0,Great at daily sweeping.,"I wish this had a longer charge (and that it turned off automatically so it didn't burn out the batteries), and a bigger dust bin.  Those issues aside, I have 3 small children, and use this 2 or 3 times a day for crumbs.  I purchased an additional battery, but I find that the battery will last for a few days of sporadic use.<br /><br />I do have to empty it a few times if the kids are particularly messy, and I've had to clean the brushes off more than once, but they make it very easy to remove the plastic casing and get to the brushes, and sent a utensil designed to clean it."
Home,4.0,The cordless swivel sweeper,Ilike the cordless swivel sweeper. I use it also on my carpet and my floors.. It beats using a broom and dust5 pan. The little pan doesn't hold much. In other words I like it. O&#62;W&#62; of Boone NC.
Home,5.0,does exactly what it promises - easy to use,I use this for papercrafting - very effective and looks good - the results can be used in many different ways - will look for more designs to buy
Home,5.0,Circle edge punch,Excellent paper punch which is easy to use with beautiful end product. I have made some stunning cards with it.
Home,5.0,Great product,"It is a great product for scrapbookers and a good value for money to buy or have one. Should the price been more cheaper, I would love to buy it more."
Home,3.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"This is a great device for use between heavy cleanings.  The only thing I don't like is the trash collector is not attached to the sweeper.  I don't like reaching in the garbage bag to retrieve it.  Otherwise, it is a really nice sweeper."
Home,1.0,IT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED!!,"BEFOR IT WAS SHIPPED OUT I CANCEED BOTH OF THE ORDERS I THOUGHT BUT ONE WAS SENT ANY WAY  I KEPT IT ONLY SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO PAY RETURE SHIPPING , I ALREADY HAVE FOUR OF THESE. THAT IS WHY I DO NOT NEED MORE!"
Home,1.0,not worth it,"this item starts out good, but with in 2 months it dies and never gets back to being good. I had to return mine ,due to it dieing. so I won't waste money on it"
Home,5.0,love it,This is the second  one that I have had and I  just love them.  I  can't use a broom because the sweeping motion hurts my back  and the  swivel  sweeper is perfect  for me.  They  pick up  just about everything.
Home,5.0,Beats a broom by miles!,"Love this little sweeper!  Had one before.  Lightweight, gets at hard-to-reach places because of the swivel action.  Great for someone with mild disabilities like me."
Home,5.0,Circle Edge Paper Punch encircled my  heart!,"The Martha Stewart Circle Edge Paper Punch, although pricey, is easy to use and produces wonderful doily shapes from 5.5&#34; to 11.5.&#34;  Sure, you can buy doilies at a store, but with this device, you can make them in any color and for the size you need.  Many uses for doilies are shown on the Martha Stewart web site, from stringing them as garlands to cutting them in fourths to use as cup cake holders.<br />The first purchase is for the system.  After that, one buys &#34;cartridges&#34; to provide additional designs for doilies."
Home,4.0,My neice loved it,"Need I say more, perfect birthday gift for a lego fan. She had it assembled in record time and was thrilled"
Home,5.0,Great Book,I am new in this art and found this book very useful. I will have to start with very simple things at first.
Home,3.0,Not what I expected,Seemed cheap; made in china concept is  good but my old vac will continue to be my mainstay unless needed in tight space quick cleaning.
Home,4.0,Love it!,"It works very well, is very easy to use, and is not too big to store in your craft space."
Home,5.0,The perfect add on,"Going to replace the honda emblem on my motorcycle with these pants, I will encased in plastic and replace it"
Home,5.0,I love the sweeper!,I use the sweeper all the time now. The handle could be a bit stronger but if you don't abuse it it will be fine. Goes a long time before needing a charge. We have cats and it picks up cat hair off the carpets even...Keep up the good work.
Home,5.0,Well worth the wait,I waited for this to come to my Michaels Store.<br />Everytime I went to get one they were out.<br />I am so glad I got it from Amazon. Price was great. No Gasoline to use to go get one.<br />As always Martha is one smart lady when it comes to an idea
Home,4.0,Not the most current swivel sweeper out there!,I didn't pay attention to the detail of this sweeper....I know there is a newer version out there that lets you just press the buttons on the top and the lid opens up over the trash can to let it fall in without having to touch the dirty catch all!  The newer version lets you swivel more easily in tight places!  But I had a swivel sweeper previous to this one and just love it because you don't have to get the vacuum out!
Home,5.0,Circle Edge Punch,"Very much enjoy using the Martha Stewart circle edge paper punch, find the minimum size circle of 6 inch, a little restrictive, if you need to make a small card, but it is very effective and gives card instant impact. Would recommend."
Home,5.0,"Love, Love, Love this!!!",This product is so amazing. What beautiful paper edges you can make. I don't know what I did without this. I have bought two more edges to play with. A must have for any scrap booker.
Home,5.0,sweeper,"Sweeper came on time and was as described, this sweeper is just great for little jobs when you do not want to have to get out the big vacuum cleaner, good for crumbs and lint."
Home,5.0,Star Wars jut,"Bought for my grandson and he loves it. Can't buy a better toy for a child, male or female. It's educational and keeps them entertained for years. I've been buying Lego for years and have always been well pleased."
Home,3.0,Not so great,"I'm disappointed in this product.  I had used the red product, the next higher quality one, which worked MUCH better.  This one flips over every time I go onto a throw rug and spews out all the dirt it has accumulated.  It works OK if I use it ONLY on a smooth surface - ceramic or wood floor.  I bought one to use at home and one in my vacation 'home' but will return the second one and get the better one for $10 more.  Having used the other one that belonged to someone else, it's well worth the extra $10.<br />3 stars."
Home,4.0,"enjoying the circle edge starter kit, wish it was a little smaller.","I like it a lot, but the size or the circle is a little too large for my cards.<br />wish she would make a smaller one."
Home,5.0,A good product for drafting and drawing,This set of six 0.2 mechanical pencils with sharpener built in is excellent set. Kohinoor is a reputed company in drawing equipment business. It took a while to arrive from Czech republic. The set is in excellent shape and came with a metal case. The colored leads are great. I may not  use them immediately as I will be drawing using graphite leads(black and white). The mechanical pencils do not have clips. It would have been nice if they came with clips. Overall it is a useful set and if you are thinking of drawing using pencils it is a good substitute.
Home,3.0,Great item fast shipping,Because i needed led lights to install in my expedition but i thought tht it would be a power source cord or maybe instruction on how to install them. & where can you install them i liked tht the strips are waterproofed but other then that i want recomend them to anyone unless they knew what they was doing
Home,5.0,"Quick cleanup,",I read all the reviews and knew I was NOT getting a vacuum cleaner. This is a lightweight electric broom and it works great.  Small enough to fit behind my kitchen cart out of sight.  The battery lasts about a week and I use it every day to pick up crumbs and the grass and leaves tracked in from the garage.
Home,5.0,Love the legos for girls,Love these Lego set's for girls.  My daughter plays with these for hours at a time.  Expensive but well worth the cost.  Now she plays with her sets all together.
Home,5.0,Love my swivel sweeper,"I will never be without a swivel sweeper.  Can clean the floors in a small amount of time.  Even though it is not a vacuum, I use on my carpets also on the days I don't feel like dragging out the big vacuum -- It does a decent job."
Home,3.0,really sucks not worth the money,I like the sweeper but would be nicer if It had more brushes on it. I am unable to lift a reg. vaccum it 's too heavy. the sweeper does not do as it days on tv. until I can order a better or a replace brush with more brushes this on will have to do thank uit kind of suchs very disappointed in this product
Home,1.0,4 Month Life - Tips: Updated 1/16,"The lightbulb shipped was a bright white instead of a warm white, and as mentioned on another review it does get hot.  It's a nice alternative to CFL's for less energy use.<br /><br />EDIT:  About 4 months after having it, using it perhaps 4-6 hours at most a day, the LED's have started to malfunction and flicker on and off every 1-3 seconds.  Considering I don't want my living room looking like a club with the lights flashing on and off, the lightbulb is now useless and far short of it's advertised lifespan (and that of most LED's) so it was not worth what was paid.<br /><br />After searching longer I found these LED bulbs that are not only a better price, but I've bought about 32 of them so far and they've all lasted the 2-3 years since I bought them with ZERO issues. Highly recommend you check these out: [[ASIN:B00KDZGBM8 TCP LA1027KND6 LED A19 - 60 Watt Equivalent Soft White (2700K) Light Bulb - 6 Pack]]"
Home,5.0,Love it,"I love it and my kids love it. This item was more that i was waiting for it. Its beautiful, have all the princess and little gems. It looks really cute. Im gonna buy another one just because i love it!"
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart Crafts Circle Edge Paper Punch Starter Kit,"Worked stright out the Box used copy paper at first  not a good resalt but when i used 120gsm card it worked fine<br /> and worked well with thicker card.<br />orderd from Amazon USA and recived in 7 days first class, After being let down in the UK"
Home,5.0,Sleek & Sturdy,Very nice wine-rack to compliment any stainless appliances you may have in your kitchen. Installs easy and holds strong if installed properly.
Home,1.0,Disappointed,"I purchased original Swivel sweeper from Menards and was quite satisfied with it, until it finally died.  I decided I liked it enough to get another from Amazon. The product was inferior in every way from the original.  The brushes are not as good, the hinged drop door was replaced with awful dust tray that comes completely off. To make a long story short I would not buy this again."
Home,4.0,I love Little Cloud....,"This is a perfect book for the very young reader.  In true Eric Carle fashion, the text and illustrations are seamless and it conveys such wonderful feelings about an old fashion pastime of watching the clouds go by.  This sis a great book for a weather unit for very young learners.  Love it."
Home,5.0,Swivel Sweeper,Great product. Just what Mom wanted to get to hard to reach spaces. Worth twice the price. Get one now!
Home,1.0,Did not care for this,I saw this advertisement and thought it was something I would enjoy using.  I coiud not get it to pick up anything and went back to my broom.  Waste of good money for me.
Home,5.0,Great Toy!,These are great toys!  The girls have so much fun playing with them and using their imaginations.  Also a great creativity toy.
Home,4.0,Kids loved it,"Bought it for my grandkids and they loved it.  It added to the already purchased set from Friends line.  Keeps the kids busy, interested and happy for long periods at a time.  Wholesome and fun LEGO item."
Home,4.0,Great service,I love my product.  I received it so soon.  It was a little cheaper. This product price does not go down to much.
Home,5.0,Super product,"As with other Martha Stewart punches, this is great.  It cuts easily and works really well.  Watch a video on YouTube before you start and then it is simple.  I am using it for scrapbooking at the moment and the shapes are lovely.  Will probably use for cards another time.  Just wish the other cartridges were a bit cheaper!!<br /><br />Great product - don't hesitate to buy."
Home,5.0,i love it,"it's quite a big tool and maybe need a little time to master using this, but the result is so pretty!"
Home,4.0,Tooo Little,"Is a very nice lego. Only that is too small. I think that may be more big. However, is a great toy."
Home,5.0,I love my swivel sweeper,I would not be without one ever again. It is perfect for all of the little crumbs in the kitchen!
Home,4.0,Martha Stewart circle punch,I am having fun using this with scrap booking. I've even purchased 2 additional punches to go with it. Would recommend for other scrapers.
Home,5.0,2nd one,I owned one of these for a couple of year and loved it.  Used it daily and the battery finally started to wear out and so it the bristles on the part that picks up the dirt so bought a new one because its handy dandy to have around.
Home,4.0,Classy Looking Recycler,"I designed shelves in my utility closet around this recycler and it looks fantastic, but I agree with some reviewers that right bin is too narrow. It would make more sense to add several inches to accommodate more bottles, in my case glass jars and bottles. Having said that, the solution I apply is to take full bag out and put aside (garage, car )and start collecting in a new bag ( by the way fitting beautifully in a bin).<br />Overall it is a classy sorter, the best on a market."
Home,5.0,This device works wonders on carpets.,I feel very happy with the swivel sweeper at its picks up lint and small dirt from my carpet.  I wish the battery would last longer; I already had to change the one I bought after a year.
Home,5.0,Super Product,The batteries last and are easy to change. This is the secont one I have owned and love it for small clean ups.  Thanks
Home,5.0,Great!,We love this wine rack.  It's unique and looks great on our wall.  We've received a ton of compliments on it and have even bought it for gifts several times too!
Home,5.0,Great Sweeper!,I bought this original sweeper when it first came out. I was always happy with it but gave it to my son for his college dorm when the new one with the hands free dirt release cup came out. It no way performed as well as the original one and after a year or so finally quit working. I recently made this purchase and am happy again with my sweeper.
Home,1.0,Thumbs down,One can't expect a young child to put this together.  There must be 100-200 mostly small pieces.  Very disappointed with the purchase.
Home,4.0,"Bright, work at 12V, tiny wires","These are bright, good quality, and work well at 12V.  Take note that the wires are very thin, so you may need to solder them in place rather than use a barrel connector."
Home,4.0,paper quilling book,"Expected a lot more on Quilling, so was dissapointed in the book itself..it's more for card making than learning how to quill."
Home,5.0,Rounding out my Lego Original Trilogy Tie Fighter Squadron,"Well, this getting to be hard to find version of the iconic TIE fighter was delivered and promptly put together and added to my collection.  I have to say it is far and away better designed than the ones I have from the older sets.  Great model for the price, and a beautiful addition to my Lego Original Trilogy collection!"
Home,5.0,The Perfect Gift for a College Student!,"For those who, like myself, are getting ready to go to college, and are going to be living in a dorm, this product is perfect! It's extremely light weight, versatile when moving around, and small enough for easy storage. This is by far the best dorm gift you could give or get at a great low price!!!"
Home,5.0,as always lego puls though,My kids love this new line of girl friendly Lego. the product is as described and your kids will love it. nice to know that a brand you know and trust keeps pumping out great products
Home,1.0,Does not work,Product displayed black but received white one.  Put in batteries and did not work.  No clear turn on and off button.  I have another that came with my roomba and it's great.  Did not stop roomba from going through a doorway.  Will double check with different &#34;c&#34; batteries that i now have to go and buy two more to make sure its not faulty batteries.
Home,5.0,Perfect !,Very pleased with this rack . Stylish and modern looking. It blends well in my kitchen among the other stainless steel appliances .
Home,3.0,It's an average to less than average device,"I had the Swivel sweeper with the flex handle before.  It was great,  It was easy to empty and held a charge.  This one is messy to empty and can't run long enough for me to do one rather small room.  Great conversation piece, but less than average product."
Home,5.0,Good for star wars fans,"10 year old son likes it because he likes star wars. Too expensive, though, as all other star wars toys."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,Awesome. Picks up food easily off Restaurant floor. Battery stays charged up to an hour of use. Love this item.
Home,4.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"Great for those  spilled crumbs, at the front door for tracked in dirt,  and around the dinner table.  I use it a LOT."
Home,5.0,just as expected,haven't assembled yet and the first of the star wars group.  i'm sure we'll end up getting more as with the other themes.
Home,5.0,Sweeper,"Fantastic product! It's my 2nd, for downstairs. Get additional batteries, they are nice to have on hand! So I had to have 2!!"
Home,1.0,SWIVEL SWEEPER,I have ordered these in the past....this one is very cheaply built....it does not have the good power of the first ones. This one falls apart every time I use it.  I put the battery on a much older one and it had twice the power.  Now the newer ones have less time for the battery life.  WHAT A SHAME
Home,4.0,veru useful,"I just received, I learning how to use it. But I can say this kind of punche is beautiful... I recommend"
Home,5.0,Love it,Great little sweeper....easy to handle...keeps the charge....has a very small waste bin but it's simple to empty....tried the swifer sweeper and this is so much better....
Home,1.0,What's There to Like?,"Well, here's a truncated list:<br /><br />It resists being propelled forward, balking up and sideways.<br /><br />If lifted even briefly when running, it fills the air with clumps of crud.<br /><br />Emptying any collected dirt defies reason. One can open only a port slightly larger than a quarter, over half of the collection chamber. There is another fixed port over the flanking chamber -- transparent so one can admire the captive sweepings.<br /><br />Do the designers want users to rap the sweeper so clotted dirt moves toward the single port? If so, my dust is intransigent. One solution: Use a bend coat hanger to scrap the chamber clear."
Home,5.0,As expected,I love it and it was as expected. I don't like surprises and that is all I ever ask for.
Home,5.0,Works fine for us,"We have simulated hardwood floors, laminated, and a dog and it is great for minor dusting and vacuuming.  I'm sure you could spend much more for an appliance that might do a better job, but for the money, tough to beat."
Home,4.0,So far so good,"My sis and Mom have one, and I've admired it from afar.  I was a little disappointed in the lead time, but the company says I ended up with a better model for the same price.  It works well on my tile floor, I intend to use it as a broom-it is not meant to be a vacuum.  It works well so far."
Home,5.0,Legos are rad,This took my daughter a long time to build but it made her happy and it made me happy so it's a good toy...
Home,5.0,Cant Live Without It,Handy time saver. Bought three more !!
Home,3.0,No good variety of card ideas,"I mainly brought it for greeting card ideas. The card ideas in this book are pretty monotonous, hence the 3 stars."
Home,5.0,Perfect!,My daughter loves this girl-conscious toy from Lego and kudos to them for being sensitive to needs of little girls.  It was perfect and she loves it!
Home,5.0,Great Item.,We use it in our motorhome and it works great.  Use it for the quick times instead of the vacuum.
Home,1.0,"It is NOT ""Made in USA""","The title of the review says it all, so save your money and go get something chiper from Walmart, probably will have better success."
Home,4.0,Perfect,"Great for making coils to saw into jump rings. They do not have measurements but they create nice and tight coils, perfect for sawing with a jewelers saw!"
Home,5.0,Cool little Gizmo!,"I saw this on a YouTube video for how to coil wire and for such a small price, I thought why not?  Well you can have loads of fun with this.  It's easy to use and although it does one simple thing, it does it well.  I was quickly able to learn how to use and within minutes had produced some cool looking coils.  By following some instructions on YouTube I was able to put coils on top of coils and made some fun earrings in a few minutes.  I recommend you practice using artistic wire until you get the hang of it.  Coiling eats up wire super fast so if you use silver or gold filled you will yourself with a small compact item that took up a lot of wire to make.  I recommend going to Auntie's Beads and looking at the video links she has on YouTube for some great instructions on how to use the gizmo."
Home,5.0,Awesome!,"My girlfriend uses this as her key ring and she loves it. It's cute, fashionable, and goes well with the Minou (also by Alessi)."
Home,3.0,Keeps falling apart,This works alright but when I empty it the flap underneath falls out and I have to fish it out of the trash.  Not what I had in mind.
Home,5.0,Punch starter kit,Brilliant results. A great asset to my craft room. I hope to collect the whole set of the cartridges. A must have.
Home,5.0,Great product!,Easy and convenient to use.  Great for quick clean ups.  Easy to empty.  So easy to use that young children can operate!
Home,3.0,The old model!,It works fine but with not as many amenities as the new one.  I use it anyways.  It gets the job done!
Home,4.0,Show,"It s good, I like it much. Is easy, simple and the efecct is amazing. I recomend it? Enjoy !"
Home,5.0,Great gift,My grandson couldn't find this set anywhere and i was very happy to see it online.  He put it together with his family and enjoyed every minute of it.
Home,5.0,Charming keychain,"I love this keychain!  The only hazard I've found is that the mouse unscrews quite easily during routine use.  I've made it a habit to check it every day to make sure it has not come loose.  On a few days it was close to coming apart completely.  Other than that it's a great keychain--it's easy to change keys, and I love the sleek yet playful style."
Home,5.0,Amazing ideas,This book covers everyone of the holidays on the calendar.  The ideas cover various ability levels from the beginner to the experienced.  Instructions are detailed and well illustrated.  So many exciting inspirations that I can't wait to try them all.
Home,5.0,Really great design,"This was a fun build. It took a little longer for me to build than other sets of similar brick count (which is a good thing). I'm really, really glad they chose not to use flat bricks again on the wings. On older TIE-series models, the offset flat bricks gave the diagonal lines a \\""staircase\\"" appearance which was very ugly in my opinion. In this model, single-piece bricks are suspended between two points, maintaining the clean, diagonal lines. Well done, LEGO."
Home,5.0,Great Little Sweeper,This is the best little sweeper.  It is so much easier than using my large vacuum.  The only drawback is the battery charger doesn't last very long.
Home,2.0,Don't buy this model- get the touchless dump feature.,"This original model requires you to go underneath and physically remove the trash picked up.  It's messy and sometimes hard to get back together and you can drop it before it gets into the trash k  I thought I was buying another one like I had, but was bitterly disappointed.  Pay the extra money for the touchless dump.  I own the flip dump model of this machine and absolutely love it."
Home,5.0,WOW! one of the best SW legos,My kid loves SW Legos and Iike building them with him. This one looks great and is even proportionate to the little lego action figure. one of the best SW Legos for the price
Home,5.0,Should have bought sooner.,"I saw the Tie Fighter in stores and online and thought it didn't look very interesting or fun to play with so I never got it. But I wanted more ships to play with with my kids so I finally ordered it and it turned out to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />It's very sturdy and well designed. My 4 year old, who is constantly breaking the other ships, can play with this one and I don't have to worry about him being too rough with it."
Home,4.0,Very cute,"A little tricky to write on with the actual chalk.  Great if you're writing ONE word--- I used it to label teas in mason jars for a tea party, and it was cute, but hard to get in 2 words and clean/erase.  Would get 5 stars if it had a better stylus."
Home,3.0,THE PRICE WAS RIGHT,"Serves the purpose, just a little too cumbersome.  The price is good though.  Makes a really good edge once you figure it out."
Home,1.0,Poor Battery Compartment Design :(,"I returned two of these units already because of the poor battery compartment design. The third one that I just recently purchased had the same exact flaw. It seems you have to wiggle the battery back and forth because the contacts in the battery compartment don't connect very well with the battery contacts. I managed to fix this by using a dremel tool and cut away the small plastic surrounding the holes on the battery, now it works like a charm.<br /><br />I rate the functionality of how it cleans much higher (4 stars) than my one star posted here but given the fact that I had to return two of them already and this one having the same issue just really ticked me off. The technical support team was of no help either.<br /><br />If you purchase this item I also recommend you purchase a dremel tool, you're going to need one."
Home,4.0,Nice set,It is a very nice set but for my taste it was too easy to build. I prefer more challenging things.
Home,5.0,"Nicely-designed, Functional Recyler","This is the third in a series of Simple Human products we've purchased for the kitchen, and have been impressed with each one.  The bin is indeed smudge-proof and designed to lift the two buckets out easily.  As our recycling is co-mingled, the separation is unnecessary, but we find we place glass in the large section, and paper and small plastic containers in the other.  The separate buckets also make is easier to tote downstairs to the large, curb-side collection recycling bin.  The large foot pedal is appreciated by my petite foot as well as my partner's size 15s, and we find the &#34;silent close lid&#34; to be a very pleasant feature.  Our trash bin which is also by Simple Human, does not sport this feature and I've found the bang of the lid to be a bit distracting when used repeatedly.  Overall, we are very pleased with this product."
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts Book is one to buy!,The book was new and had many craft ideas I think I will use. Pictures of crafts were great and instructions were easy to follow.
Home,5.0,Good sweeper,Good pick up and battery lasts long.  Great way to pick up small messes on the carpet and hardwood floor
Home,5.0,easy as pie,"actually, easier than pie  :)  Easy set up and use.  Plenty of instructions on line for more elaborate uses.  The only thing I would change is to inrease the length of the crank rods so one could make a coil longer than (almost) 6 inches."
Home,5.0,Dear Martha,"Martha is the best, no question.  I have a ton of her craft supplies, crafting tools, etc. I started my obsession, I mean my collection 3 years ago for my wedding, and I haven't stopped. I love all things Martha.  This book is a great book of ideas."
Home,1.0,NOT a touchless dirt tray,"dumb that you buy this sweeper, but when you get it the cheaper version doesnt have a touchless dirt release.  the dirt tray it gross.  Just too bad the ad doesn't tell you it's crap"
Home,5.0,LEGO Star Wars Tie Fighter 9492,"I wouldn't know, but I'm sure my Grandson would say it's teriffic.  He plays with it all the time.  Legos never wear out"
Home,5.0,My Grand daughter loved it.,Great little play set for the age range.  Granddaughter had fun assembling and the playtime was nice with the little scenarios she imagined.
Home,5.0,Can't go wrong with LEGO,My granddaughter loves playing with it.  LEGO is always a favorite with kids and it keeps them entertained for hours.
Home,5.0,Love it.,"It's not available in Singapore and it came speedily.  Easy to use, usual signature design fit for not only scrap booking but party setting, food deco and many other usages.  Value choice."
Home,4.0,"good product, very convienient!",This sweeper is a must have in my book. Once you experience having one you almost cannot go without it. only downside is that the one I received was brand new in the box and I charged the battery accordingly but it never would really hold a charge. My fault for not sending it back but I had a lithium ion from a previous one I owned so that one worked perfect. I would recommend grabbing one of these.
Home,1.0,Not a clean punch,"I bough 4 four of these puncher for my friends. And I own of them but everytime I punch, it is always not a clean punch. Same as the other 3 circle edge punch, they face the same situation like mine.<br /><br />Maybe it is the catridge has become blunt. Luckily other catridge desgin can be bought separately and use with the same starter kit base. I want to test with other cartidge later."
Home,5.0,Wire coiling is cool!,"I had one of these with only two mandrels, so I knew what I was getting with this one with more sizes to coil. This one also has the attachment for temporarily fastening it to your work table, so If you don't have a large enough workshop to be able to screw it to a table and keep it there, you can put it all in a bag or container and keep it in a drawer or on a shelf when not using it. It's a space saver. The one I had before would have to be permanently attached, or hand held in order to be used, and I found I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to have the stability this one offers."
Home,5.0,Cute.,My son gave his to his science teacher at school because he's a big trekkie and because brownie-points.  It worked well.
Home,5.0,Great Wire Coiling Gizmo,If you have ever coiled wire by hand you know it can take hours to do large projects.  This really does do it much faster & once you learn to use it and find your rhythm it also coils much more symmetrically than by hand.<br /><br />There are a couple different Coiling Gizmo products by Beadalon but this is the better version and the stabilizing bar is much larger.  The other version is much smaller & does not offer as many size variations. I purchased the smaller one first then found this one on Amazon for about the same price I paid for the smaller version.<br /><br />As with any new gadget there is a bit of a learning curve but there are some great videos on YouTube to help you out.
Home,3.0,Difficult to install,"Don't be fooled by the many reviewers who misleadingly claim that this product is easy to install.  If you are a generally quite handy person, you may have no difficulty.  But precision is required, given that this is a product designed to hold a lot of quite valuable weight on drywall.  After a fair amount of effort, I was able to install mine (making sure to drill into studs), though it doesn't feel quite as secure as I'd like to put my mind at ease.  The basic mechanics involved seem just a bit off, as there are no hooks--just screws and stainless steel cylinders that support the full weight of 8 bottles of wine.  The finished product looks nice on the wall, though if you have children or pets, take great care to make sure that they go nowhere near the wine rack."
Home,1.0,2/3 burned out in my sons room after 2 months.,"I like the price.  I like the light output.  I like the low use of energy.  I DON'T LIKE the premature failure. The box says these are supposed to last 18.26 years based on 3hrs/day use.  Two of the three bulbs I bought burned out in about 2 months in my sons room.  It is now too late to return the items to the seller.  Now I am stuck having to deal with the manufacturer.  I'll try to update this review, depending on the response I get from Lighting Ever. Update 11/23/2013 I called Lighting Ever, they acted like they were going to send me replacement bulbs at no cost.  I have yet to receive any replacement bulbs or refund. Since the initial review, more of these bulbs have burned out.  I have many LED bulbs in my 5,000+ square foot house.  None have been as bad as these.  I WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THESE BULBS!"
Home,4.0,"Love, but the pin clip fell off","Cosplay worthy pin, did meet all my expectations, only problem is that the pin falls of easily. Fast shipping in a ok box with no damage to product"
Home,5.0,As described.,"There was some slight wear to the cover, but that often happens when someone ships a book.  The corners usually aren’t covered.  The recipient of this gift loved it and used it right away.  This is a good gift for a craft lover."
Home,2.0,Not so great to hold the grapes,"Not so great,bottles nest upward not perfectly horizontal. They need to rethink this one. It also said German made in the description. the box it came in said made in China. What's up with that?? I will use for now. But, $50.00 was too much. Should be half the price."
Home,5.0,Great toy--on sale!,"This toy is now $39, which is less than we paid--a good price.  My 10-year old son really likes it. He says, \\""It's really fun to build.  It comes with a death star trooper, a tie fighter, an imperial officer, and an R-2 unit. It has two missiles under the cockpit.  The only problem is the wings fall off sometimes when you're playing with it.\\"""
Home,5.0,Christmas gift,"She loved them, couldn't find in stores any where was sold out. Only thing she ask for. Had to find"
Home,4.0,Great product and good price,These mechanical pencils are great. I did not know they came with the lead already in them so that was a plus.<br /> They also arrived in good shape and in a nice little tin holder with an eraser as shown. So product is good.<br />My only complaint was the shipping was slow. I ordered on Aug. 22 and just got my package today Sept. 6th.
Home,5.0,An Awesome Series of Punches,I rated this item because I really like it.  When I first saw the demo on youtube I was inspired to create something different.  My good friend Ruth recommended that I check it out and now I have four additional punch designs.
Home,5.0,Awesomeness,"Great.  Just what the grandboy wanted. Lego products are exceptional, never ever can you go wrong with a Lego toy."
Home,1.0,not even close,Was to not even close to wht I and my daughter thought its just tiny kitty like a key chain<br />totally off my thought
Home,5.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"The product arrived several days after I ordered it instead of the anticipated shipment date.  It is easy to put together.  I purchased the sweeper specifically for a quick clean-up with my area rug under my dining room table, as well as other areas in need of a quick clean-up.  It arrived yesterday. I charged the battery last night.  I used it this morning and it is an EXCELLENT product.  It is also very easy to empty the tray with all the debris inside.  I am very happy with the entire transaction.  I highly recommend this product."
Home,2.0,i bought it for my grandchild,"as i said above i bought it for my grandchild and even for me its not easy to use ,unfortunatley"
Home,4.0,fun cutter,I have never seen anything like this and found it really easy to use.<br />I will be using it a lot.
Home,5.0,"Star Wars + LEGO's, Enough said",Easy build instructions and result is impressive. They use some clever tricks to get it to fit together. Comes out the size you would expect.
Home,5.0,Love this set,I am a 23 year old Lego and Star Wars fan.  I loved building this set and it looks great displayed next to the UCS Red Five X-Wing.
Home,5.0,Cute!,Super cute stickers and I loved that the chalk is included. Makes things much easier. Can't wait to use them at our wedding.
Home,5.0,Another Quality LEGO Product,"Very pleased with this! It sure ooks great, and it was fun to build. A wonderful addition to my collection."
Home,5.0,Great product.,I love the way this product works and how good the results come out. With no practice I was able to make the product preform just as advertised. Beautiful perfect circles!
Home,5.0,Incredible tool,Martha Stewart always innovating. The cut is perfect. Easy to use. I love the possibility to work with several sizes at once.
Home,5.0,Love This!,This is so easy to use and adds a lot to your scrapbook pages.  I love that you can make the design any size you need from 6&#34; to 12&#34;.  I like the doily design a lot and will be adding more cartridges also.
Home,4.0,Purchased as gift.  The box was totally damaged.  Not the shipping box but the one in the photo at left.  Disappointing!,"The box was obviously damaged when it was put in the shipping box.  Had I had time to return it I would have.  Again, disappointing."
Home,4.0,Simple and modern,Looks really nice in the kitchen with my stainless steel appliances. I might have gone overboard but I actually went out to buy wine bottles that matched the color scheme of my kitchen. But it looks great!!!<br /><br />It's very sturdy and I lucked out with studs in the location exactly where I wanted to display the wall mount. Not sure if it was necessary. I think on a dry wall you just need screws along with plastic anchors and you might be ok.
Home,2.0,POOR BATTERY LIFE,"I was able to use it only once, after that the battery died and now I have to buy another battery. I do not recommend this product to anybody."
Home,5.0,Great Lego toy and just as presented,"My 9 year old daughter just loves Lego friends.  She has been asking for this set for a couple of months and I found it a great price.<br />Since my daughter is a Lego fan, she found it easy with a little challenges to built it.<br /><br />We just loved"
Home,3.0,Its OK,"I bought this book thinking I would find a lot of new crafts that I had not seen before from Martha. I have to say that a lot of the crafts that you will find in this book you can find on her website under crafts. I am going to keep this book because of the ease of having the crafts at hand rather than going online. If you are debating on whether or not to get this book though, remember all of these crafts you can find online."
Home,5.0,Great,Ordered this for my boss for Christmas. It's in a plastic packaging for the new movies. But the pin looks nice. Sturdy. I now want one for myself! Would buy again.
Home,5.0,Yay!,"I was so excited to find these at Amazon.com! I have used these for years. Love it! Never seem to be able to find in the stores! I cannot live without one in the house, camper and even use it to clean up the boat! Thanks!"
Home,1.0,Appears some are defective,"Since day one this swivel sweeper had problems with the connection in the sweeper and unable to hold a charge.<br />I have had 2 swivel sweepers in past (one at office and one at home) and both worked fine until worn out.<br />Unfortunately I had discarded the box upon opening and doing the overnite original charge. I kept trying to use it with the defects and finally gave up.<br />When I contacted the seller, As Seen on TV, they would not replace as it was after 30 days and did not offer any other options."
Home,5.0,Newbie,"I am new to these circle edge paper punches. I am sure I will love them as much as my other Martha Stewart dies. I was a little surprised how large the &#34;smallest&#34; punch is, but will still enjoy them."
Home,5.0,Great,Works well used daily in day spa for pedicure massage. The item is used in my day spa for pick up during business<br />when vacuuming is too disturbing.
Home,2.0,Disappointed,"Besides the fact it took well over a month to get this in the mail from the date I ordered it, it does NOT hold a charge very long. This is my 3rd swivel sweeper (I ordered the other two directly from swivelsweeper.com) and I never had any problems with my last 2. The first one last several years and the second one I accidently broke. They both held a charge. I could use the other two several times in several rooms before having to charge it again. I have been using this one from Amazon for over 2 months, almost daily. I have to charge this one as soon as I'm done using it on my kitchen floor because, the battery is dying which, is not a way huge area. I don't know if I just got a bad one. I know it's not the battery because, I've been using my battery from my last one to see if it is the battery that came with it but, the swivel sweeper still doesn't hold a charge long. Now I have to spend more money on another one. I'm not happy about that at all."
Home,5.0,Happy with this Product,My daughter is into this type of thing and says that she is very happy with it.  The price is also better than the local retail stores.
Home,5.0,Very good!  I am so excited for Halloween,I bought the pin so I could be Captain Kirk for Halloween.  It came in a timely fashion with all its pieces (namely the two pin covers on the back) and was in perfect condition.  The two pins on its back hold it up very well instead of letting it get top heavy or wobble around too much.<br /><br />Now if you wanted to get really detail oriented I can tell you that you can see the small scratches in the metal from being formed.  But they are so small that you can't see them unless you look hard and it is still smooth and lustrous like the picture.  I find I like the little things because they give it a bit of texture and maybe indicate that Captain Kirk has already gone through some battles.<br /><br />Be assured that if you want a Star Trek captain's badge then this is the one you should be getting.  It is a great size (big enough to not get lost in the fabric or anything) and weight (not too heavy to pull down your shirt but heavy enough to lay right and solidly).
Home,5.0,Woot woot,What more is there to say its Star Wars in Lego form<br /><br />It's a great size and has a nice weight to it great display piece
Home,3.0,"Not Screen ready, but durable.","This is not nearly as acceptable as a version that would be used on screen but it is an accurate replica and works well from a distance. The pins may be hard to connect / break easily but if you're looking for something just to use as a display, it is very good."
Home,5.0,You paid HOW much for a trash can??,"Didn't tell the SO how much we paid for it until it was unwrapped and set up. We LOVE this thing, and the price tag became a non-issue once it was in action. It's spendy, but with a 10 year warranty and completely solid and smart construction, it's entirely worth it.<br /><br />We replaced an old plastic trashcan with this, and it works perfectly for our needs. We love the fact that there's a separate compartment for the recycling, and the liners are great. We're seriously considering purchasing the SimpleHuman liners in bulk. It's incredibly easy to keep clean, it looks great, and it can bear the weight of our dopey 15lb cat without denting (nice bonus, but we discourage his jumping on it as much as we can).<br /><br />We haven't had any issues with the lid banging against the wall (another reviewer mentioned) unless we're particularly forceful in stepping down. It doesn't require a lot of pressure to open, so we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />The trashcan itself is huge (in a good way) - it doesn't look as big in the pictures which made me nervous until I grabbed the measuring tape. It won't hold as much trash as a conventional trashcan might, but we really don't need to hoard our trash that long either, so taking it out when it's full works and helps us avoid old trash stink in the kitchen.<br /><br />That being said, with the lid and the construction of the trash can, smelly stuff doesn't really escape unless the lid is open. All in all, we love it and we'd buy it again if we had to (but shouldn't need to for at least 10 years)."
Home,5.0,Great,"Honestly i was expecting something cheap because that is how everything is these days. I was pleasently surprised when i got this. Good quality, durable, does exactly what it needs to do."
Home,5.0,Grandson Thrilled,Colby (age 9) had been wanting this for awhile when I surprised him.  Put it together immediately and it looks great.  He'll take it apart and put it back together several times.
Home,5.0,Great punch,The started punch is wonderful and come with a very useful design. Love that you can make different size doilies.
Home,5.0,not yet given,"This is intended as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son. He's a star wars fanatic for some reason. He has many star wars Legos and loves them all. No Legos sit for very long without being played with or created into something. So, that's why 5 stars. I know this will be a hit. It keeps him thinking, creating and away from TV and video games."
Home,5.0,It's really cool !,Just what I wanted.  Shipping was fast.  It was everything I expected and more.  I would recommend this item to any Star Trek fan. Thank you!
Home,5.0,Good value,"It still is in the box, but someday I will put it together.<br /><br />Lego's are for kids of ALL ages."
Home,5.0,Great for Cosplay!,"Solid construction, and perfect size for a costume! I'm very happy with it. The two pins are on the right side of the badge (the thicker side) and support the badge unnoticeably well. It has good weight, but doesn't droop your shirt. I would definitely recommend this product for any costume/cosplay. On a quite nerdy note: There is nothing like putting this on your shirt for the first time! It feels so real, you can't help but tap it and say, &#34;(Your name) to the bridge.&#34;"
Home,5.0,Made my life easier,"The swivel sweeper has made my life much easier. I have tile floors, so now instead of using a dust mop or broom, I use the swivel sweeper."
Home,5.0,Beautiful lacy circles,"After a bit of experimenting, I finally got the punch to work (trying to get a full 12&#34; circle).  Love it now."
Home,5.0,Star Trek Badge,I bought the Spock shirt which came with a plastic badge which really looked tacky. This metal badge looks much more authentic and makes the quality level of the Spock outfit much better.
Home,5.0,One of my best purchases to date!,"Very stylish and fits our home perfectly, lots of compliments from friends.  Price was good also so highly recommend this."
Home,4.0,love it,I bought mine from Ross store for 24 dollars. I don't like or trust  things I seen on tv but I was looking for something  for my hardwood floors.  would give it 5 stars but it doesn't pick up things like paper that's bigger than a  quarter.
Home,4.0,Craft ideas for your holidays,"It is probably cheesy but I wanted to see the ideas Martha had for holiday decoration.  I am pleased to report that she lived up to her reputation of clever easy craft ideas, best of all most of them are cheap!  I tried her Easter egg decorating ideas and appeared above average ingenious when company arrived for Easter dinner.  The projects have clear instructions with pictures for those who only read instructions as a last resort—yeah, you know who you are.  For more craft book reviews check [...]"
Home,5.0,Great item!,Good item for Star Trek fun- is made of heavier duty metal and is true to the original design. Would recommend.
Home,3.0,"Great, but not functional.","For my Star Wars enthusiast 8 year old son this was a perfect gift. The sounds are completely realistic and the projection is okay, however, it is so difficult to set the alarm. You have to go through a series of steps, and it's just too much to do each day. He doesn't use the alarm now which was the main reason we purchased it, so we are disappointed."
Home,5.0,It is great!,It is great! I love it and it looks very good. It is a good toy and I will buy related toy further.
Home,5.0,Perfect,I only wish I had found this sooner!  It's a major time saver and it's made my life so much easier and painless making these coils for jump rings!
Home,5.0,Good set to build,This Lego set is a good size and fun to put together. My husband had it done in a day. Great for a day project.
Home,5.0,Great little gadget!,"Its a great little device if you don't expect it to do too much ...... it works well on smooth floors like linoleum or tile or wood, but you'll have to clean the brushes often if medium to long hair is regularly swept up."
Home,5.0,Great Lego set,"I bought this Lego set for my niece's birthday (who says teenage girl's can't have a Star Wars obsession also?). She really loves the set and it looks great assembled. I didn't put it together, obviously since that would be terrible of me...no matter how much I was tempted to). She said it was great though and it seems to fit together really well.<br /><br />Just as a note, this does not contain a Darth Vader figure in it. I could have sworn the picture showed him in it, but it's actually a stormtrooper."
Home,3.0,Not happy,Very unhappy with book. Nothing noteworthy or eye-catching.<br />I suppose I expected much more from Martha Stewart. Clearly not worth purchase price.
Home,5.0,Looking forward to jazzing up my jewelry designs!,I saw this tool demonstrated and wanted to learn how to make wire-wrapped beads and charms. Initial set up and samples have been easy to learn. All parts arrived and delivery time was good. Thanks.
Home,5.0,Very good replica,This is a really good replica. It actually looks like the ones in the movies and it's very light.<br />It has two brooches to help hold it in place so you won't have to worry about it being upside down.<br />I would highly recommend it!
Home,4.0,Love It and Hate It,"I love the 'idea' of this punch but at times it is difficult to use.  I've recently bought another punch pattern and for some reason, the larger of a circle you make the pattern comes out different and doesn't line up correctly.  Also, when you press down to make your punch if you don't line it up right you will dull the metal and it will not cut neatly with future punches.  I bought the other punch pattern at a craft store and I was able to exchange it due to the dulling of the metal (I've only had it for 2 days).  This product gives me a headache when I use it but at the same time, I love it.  I love the idea and I love the end product......just don't look too closely at;  you'll then see where the metal doesn't cut it smoothly and it looks like there are 'fuzzies' everywhere.  If you have used this, then you will know what I am talking about.  I gave it a nice 4 star only because I love the whole idea of it.  If the end result of the punch looked horrible, I would then give it a 1 star."
Home,5.0,MMMMMMMMMM,Bamm son to the tune of two twenty two and then one son mom dada son father mother sister uncle aunt cousin nephew niece.
Home,5.0,"Ideal ""cat person"" gift",Bought it for a Christmas gift for a good friend who is a &#34;cat person&#34;.  It makes a perfect gift.
Home,5.0,Great buy!,I wore the pin on my Halloween costume and it looked awesome. Loads of people complimented me on it so I'd recommend this to anyone.
Home,1.0,swivel sweeper sucks,item broke 1 month after purchase. spits out dirt and finally cracked. absolute piece of garbage. great idea...very poor quality and execution.
Home,5.0,"My grandson is really into the Lego sets, and this one he loves","I bought this for my six year old grandson and his Mother said he loves it.  He uses his imagination, and with other Lego sets he has, does a whole war game on the living room floor."
Home,1.0,DO NOT BUY!!  IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE THEY ADVERTISE!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!! I was so excited to get the Swivel Sweeper.  It sounded like and end to my frustrations trying to keep my floors clean.  Easy assembly.  I charged the battery according to directions, and was very anxious  to put this sweeper to the test.<br />About 25 minutes after I started cleaning my floors, it just stopped working.  I thought maybe hair caused the problem, so I used that tool to get all the hair out of the brushes.  No luck.  Then I thought that maybe the battery died even though it is supposed to last 45 minutes.  I plugged the battery in, waited 12 hours, and No Luck!  I can not get this sweeper to work.  The only truth about this sweeper is that it assembles easily and is light weight.  VERY disappointed, and back to searching for a new vacuum for my hardwood floors."
Home,4.0,Brilliant,"It is very good tool, look as advertised, and works smoothly and of high quality but not so easy to use because need to wiggle it around to punch through"
Home,4.0,Good quality.,"A big upgrade over the plastic pin that came with my costume.  Not too heavy (I worried it would make the shirt sag).  It uses two pin posts, which I think is smart since it distributes the weight of the pin."
Home,5.0,I am enjoying this item!,"It was a little tricky to get started but once I got the hang of it, I realized I will really enjoy this piece of 'equipment'."
Home,5.0,MS Holiday Craft Book,Enjoy working on crafts with family I dont understand why saying you simply like and enjoy something isnt enough. so here are a bunch of extra words and i will never rate anything again
Home,5.0,cordless swivel sweeper,"l love this cordless swivel sweeper it is the bomb.  It works good everywhere, I go under everything, on stairs."
Home,3.0,Ok,Used it to label candy jars at a wedding and it took way to long to write on them .The chalk didn't work well.
Home,5.0,A great replacement bulb,Works very well in with our living room lighting. Has a nice soft glow and makes reading easy. It will last much longer than the incandescent bulb it replaces. I'll buy another one as soon as the other light in the fixture burns out.
Home,5.0,"Great at ""Cats""","We order one of these calendars every year as we have a cat, and these photos are so delightful and so &#34;cat.&#34;  Last year, I purchased a different calendar for my husband, and we both regretted not seeing a new cat every day.  The qualities of these photos and the unique locations and cat expressions make this my favorite calendar ever."
Home,5.0,Great product in Jewelry making,This is a great jewelry making tool. I love how easy it is. I think it will be just right for you too. I am never disappointed when I order it from Amazon.
Home,4.0,Good design and easy to use.,I know that this product is a good one but I haven't used it yet. My friend has one that I saw her use.
Home,5.0,No More Odors,"Replaced a similar, though smaller recycling bin with this one.  This is large capacity and easy to use.  Best of all, it keeps the putrid odors from empty dog food cans contained.  Got a slighted dented one for $30 less than perfect."
Home,4.0,PACKAGING SUCKS,"The pin is very nice, however the packaging was disappointing. It was a gift and I guess from other ads I expected it to be in a box not a blister package. However the product is nice so far."
Home,5.0,Star Trek replica prop,Well made.  This prop replica of the Starfleet Command Division is made of quality metal.  Great addition for any Star Trek aficionado.
Home,5.0,Fun!,"This is super fun to use.  Bought one for my daughter, tried it, kept it, and ordered a second one for her."
Home,5.0,bf is a fan,got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. he's a huge star trek fan and he was surprised that i got him the correct one (he prefers the command like picard). it fits with his other themed gifts as well.
Home,4.0,LEGO Star Wars Tie Fighter 9492,"My grandson liked this LEGO Star Wars Tie Fighter 9492 , if you have more star wars at good price please let me know."
Home,5.0,Worth Every Bit!,"Ordered this to complete my hand-made costume for a local convention; it was perfect! Solid metal, but not heavy enough to pull the fabric of my shirt down (I wore a regular cotton knit similar to t-shirt fabric). It was secure and comfortable to wear and I got TONS of complements on an amazing outfit! From one genre geek to another, this is a great buy!"
Home,4.0,Originals Were Better.,This original sweeper had a strong stick that did not seem breakable.  The under-the-furniture feature on the newer style was difficult to use as it felt fragile.  I wish these originals were still available.
Home,5.0,Great Additional Wall,"Just as compatible as what came with my unit. Works great, no setup just unboxing and batteries. Perfect gift if you know somone with a roomba."
Home,5.0,Easy and pretty!,"This product was the first materials after deciding scrapbooking as my hobby.<br />This is for making beautiful edge of paper. It is very easy to use and make fantastic decoration papers for scrapbooks, albums, wall decoration and so on. Nobody need to be afraid of fail even a beginner. Just follow direction when you try very first time, and you will ready to be advanced!!"
Home,5.0,Perfect Command Pin,"This pin is precisely as advertised: a nicely-crafted, durable, attractive metal Federation Command pin. I gave it to an avid Trekker who loves it (he's wearing it on his hat at the moment). It's sturdy & well made; if you have a ST fan on your gift list this makes an excellent & inexpensive present."
Home,5.0,My Son loved it!!!,"Really great, good size, fun to build and a great price as legos go.<br />need more words need more words"
Home,4.0,For little perfectionists!,"Shipping was great and on time. I was disappointed at first because it was a board book, and I bought it for a 5 year old. One a second look, I think it will be great for her because she is a perfectionist and this will be both funny, and help her not to get so frustrated when something happens to her art- like a 3 year old brother making his won mark on it! It's a cute book with a good message."
Home,3.0,Great product but...,"The Cordless Swivel Sweeper is a great product! Easy to manouvre, provides a quick and easy way of picking up day-to-day dust, crumbs, etc. BUT.... Beware, the battery (or so we think) stopped working after only just 1.5 months, beyond which the warranty no longer covers!!! Extremely disappointed!"
Home,5.0,It was fun to see a new cat each day.,I enjoyed seeing a new cat each day and also the little comments that were on the top of each page.  Just wish I could have gotten a refill rather than buying the complete calendar again. I did buy a couple of them for gifts.
Home,5.0,Great ideas,I liked the book and considering the many craft ideas for the different holidays.  Martha's instructions are always so easy to read and implement.
Home,4.0,A great present for my grandaughter,"The toybox is quite nice and seems very well made. I thought the box would contain a number of Barbie accessories and was disappointed that it didn't. I contacted the company and, although there is VERY small print notice that dolls and accessories are not included, the company agreed there was room for misunderstanding. Their customer service was outstanding and they have agreed to review and revise the ad to clear up any possible confusion. I'm convinced this is a reputable company and I'd gladly do business with them again."
Home,3.0,Not perfect,I thought this would be exactly like my first one but this one is very difficult to empty and doesn't just drop down and empty out the trash. The entire bottom comes off. There wasn't a pick included with this one to clean out the brushes. Other than that it's OK
Home,5.0,The Boss.,The Boss and I are great friends.  We do the once around every day and sometimes in between.  Why do I call  it the &#34;BOSS&#34;?  It is my BATTERY OPERATED SWIVEL SWEEPER.  I have given them to my daughters as gifts and they too are delighted with the sweeper.
Home,2.0,first time Amazon has disappointed me,i ordered 2 new sweepers<br />i got one that was new<br />and one that was used and also broken(but it was in new wrappers and new box)<br />i could not  fix the broken handle<br />so i will have to trash it
Home,4.0,Cordless sweeper.,I BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE FROM A RETAILER AND LIKED IT SO MUCH i BOUGHT TWO MORE  ON LINE FOR TWO OF MY CHILDREN. THE ONLY DRAW BACK TO IT IS THAT IT DOESN'T GET IN THE CORNERS AS WELL AS I WOULD LIKE. BUT I REMEMBER THAT IT IS A SWEEPER AND  I LIKE THAT IT IS ANGLED SO THAT I CAN GET UNDER FURNITURE.
Home,3.0,Reuseable only if your surface is totally smooth.....,"I love these on my containers that have a totally smooth base, however if you have one that has a bump in it or curve, they just don't want to stick.....otherwise they are ok."
Home,4.0,Fun for all ages,This was my first lego set that I built in an hour and a half. It's a start to a very fun hobby and I plan to find more.
Home,5.0,If you can stand watching laserdisc quality...,"...then this is the most magnificent way to watch this saga.  Only available on VHS and laserdisc (and really, laserdisc now looks to my eye the way I used to think about VHS a few years ago), this is Coppola's beautiful restructuring of the story.  Missing scenes restored, straightforward chronology (for the most part), and being able to see it more the way people watch a season of \\""Breaking Bad\\"" (in binges), I would agree with the reviewers who wrote when it was released that this cut finally makes Part III work as a fully emotionally-satisfying ending.  Shower Paramount (or how about Criterion?) with emails and letters to get this released on DVD and Blu-Ray.  It's time!"
Home,4.0,so many good ideas,so many good ideas for any holiday - tells you everything you will need.  Lots of pictures to help you get it done
Home,5.0,Easy to Assemble and Holds all the wine bottle weight :),"Was afraid it wouldn't be sturdy enough, but it is WONDERFUL. i would recommend it.<br />Only can be used with certain wine bottles..not the champagne style bottles"
Home,3.0,Wish it was 1 page for each day like it used to be where Saturday and Sunday had their own page,"Not everyone only works a 5 day week so when Dilbert started mashing Saturday and Sunday on the same page, it was very disappointing a few years ago.  They need to put it back to individual pages and have 365 pages per year.  Jokes don't seem to be as funny as they used to be but that is probably due to my aging.  However, once in awhile the man of the house gets a chuckle and points it out to me whereas otherwise I don't even read the jokes anymore.  I use it to write notes on what I need to get done that day or dentist appointments."
Home,4.0,oh~~,Ever spent much bigger in size than other punches. This unique and simple to use. The order was also a different shape. Expected.
Home,1.0,Virtual wall lighthouse,Because when i install the batteries did not work. I loose My money! And i don't how to send to you
Home,4.0,Great product,"The quality of the badge is great.  I had it on my wishlist for awhile and someone bought it for me for Christmas.  I got lots of compliments, but over a very short time period.  I had decided I was going to wear it to work everyday-because why not.  First 8 hour shift went fine, then about 3 hours into the second one the bottom pin back broke.  I had to take it off as it was stabbing me in the chest.  I don't usually wear wear clips/badges/pins on my shirt, so I don't know how common or uncommon of an issue this is.  I am currently placing an order and adding some rubber pin backs-50 pack for $6.61.  This would have easily been a 5 star review if the backing hadn't broke, especially so quickly.  It was most definitely not misused/hit/abused while I was working.  Eh well as soon as my order comes in the badge will be back to 100% in no time."
Home,5.0,Star Trek Starfleet Command Division Badge,"Awesome looking badge, gave it as a Christmas present and the receiver Loved it. Made from metal so it did not look cheap, and has a good weight feel. Nice replica"
Home,5.0,very good,"It is a very good product. Light ,easy to clean the floor or carpet. Also easy to remove the inside dirty. I got 4. One for my sister, my daughter, my mother in law and for myself"
Home,5.0,Great book for teaching Quilling,Great book for teaching Quilling.  Great ideas and simple steps to follow.  Students in my class had a great time learning and creating.
Home,5.0,Love it,"Simply love it, I can cut circles with beautiful edges and in a so easy way, just love it, it is great"
Home,5.0,Perfect,"This was exactly what I expected.  It didn't arrive when expected, but this year the UPS, and USPS were all running behind.  Perfect Gift.  Thank you."
Home,3.0,Broke too easy!!,"It was more work to clean it after use than it was to just use my own vacuum, that is ridiculous!!"
Home,5.0,QMx Star Trek Starfleet Division Badge - Command,"Captains-to-be, this is for you, but it would have been nice if it came with a magnetic backing rathern than pins as those could destroy your uniform.  If you bought an ANOVOS, you would not think of piercing it. They are about 2.5 inches from top to bottom."
Home,5.0,Awesome read!,The book was awesome...I had already read it ..I bought copies for both my two daughters...they loved it as well.
Home,5.0,Loved it,"I got this item as a gift for my Father. He watched Startrek as a kid and raised me watching Startrek. Most of my family loves the crap out of Startrek. ANYWAYS, This item was shipped promptly, and arived in a box that was undamaged! It is a solid piece and my Father loved it! The other badges also make great gifts and additions if you are collecting!"
Home,5.0,Perfect!,I'm actually really surprised with the quality of the pin! It's a nice weighted metal and is polished beautifully. It just pins to your shirt like a regular pin - it has two pins for security and keeping it in place. Really happy with it! Especially for the price I got it for! :D
Home,3.0,Like the older model better,"I had this product from several years ago, it was red.  I broke the handle on my old one so I had ordered this one.  Pan is very messy to empty.  Battery life is good. Still like the original red one better."
Home,5.0,Super,"It happen to be the thing that I wanted! Bottles hold perfectly and it looks amazing, just as I wanted to"
Home,5.0,Perfect tool for crafts,"Is a tool very useful for crafts to do a lot of beautiful things. For the vendor, only little offtime because customs."
Home,1.0,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,"I received only the sweeper.  The battery, and long handle to hold the sweeper, and the battery charger is missing.  The box looks like it was opened.  The directions were missing. I paid over $60 for this.  I have emailed the dealer.  How can I use a one foot sweeper without battery or handle to hold it?  Very Bad Business.  I would like a complete refund of my money if this cannot be resolved.  I will submit ONTEL to the better business bureau.  Please contact this dealer."
Home,5.0,Dilbert Rules,"As always, Dilbert is awesome.  Good thing Workman Publishing doesn't publish it, or they may decide they aren't making enough money and quit selling it."
Home,5.0,A must have for the scrapbooker in you!!,I was at a Scrapbooking retreat when I saw a lady using this tool and knew I had to have it.  I love it!!!  It's easy to use and it looks so beautiful with the different cartridges you can purchase.  The ladies that were with me have all ordered one as well.  I told a couple of scrapbookers on my job about it and guess what....they ordered it too :-)<br /><br />I hightly recommend it and I have recommended it.
Home,5.0,Great product for the Star Wars lover,"The projection was quite good, the only thing I would say as an improvement would be for the settings to be easier accessed."
Home,5.0,Love!!!,I love to scrapbook and I LOVE punches! This punch is so neat and I want them all!! If you get want go to YouTube and watch videos on how to use it. Really helped!!
Home,5.0,Awesome,"Cool, heavy, exactly what I wanted. Will work great for Halloween! Looks just like the movie, and it will likely last longer than a patch."
Home,5.0,A+ Badge,"This is a well crafted replica.  Made of solid metal, beautiful, durable and well presented in its packaging.  A fun gift for any Trek fan."
Home,5.0,Impressed,"I was impressed with this little tool. I always cut a piece of paper, so I can see how it cuts, so I can get the excess oil off of the tool, so I don't ruin good paper, and lastly so I make a sample of the pattern to place in an example book to reference later. I did put this tool together wrong, but found a happy &#34;problem&#34;. I'm guessing most have already discovered this, but if you put the cartridge holder (the plastic piece that goes on the base to determine the size of the circle) in backwards, you can cut your circle to use it as a border. Instead of cutting the circle out of your paper with the design on the outside, you can cut the circle out, so the design is on the inside of the paper.<br /><br />The tool seems very sturdy, I am not one to follow directions, and I just dive into putting items together. I put this together wrong, Instead of sliding the plastic size determining piece into the bottom of the base, I kind of shoved it in the teeth area. I was afraid, once I realized my mistake, that I might break the tool trying to fix my problem, but the plastic piece came out without anything breaking. Don't let this scare you into thinking it is hard to use, it really is very easy."
Home,5.0,Cute and functional!,"I had gotten a few scarves for Xmas and didn't want to keep hanging them on top of each other on a closet hook.  This organizer is really cute, holds LOTS of scarves and allows you to have access to all of them with their own individual rings.  It's simple and stylish!"
Home,5.0,Best Cordless Sweeper Ever!!!,I love love love this sweeper.  This is my second one and it is awesome for a quick sweeper that is very compact.
Home,5.0,Nice Badge,I like how this badge looks. Its heavy enough to give you a scene of quality but not too heavy to sag down your shirt. If you are a fan of the  new movies you will like this.
Home,5.0,Wow!,I got this book for my Mom as a Christmas gift and she just loves it.<br />This book is full of lots of cool projects and information.
Home,5.0,This is a great tool to have,I have been making jewelry for about a year now and I am so glad to have this tool. I have seen such gorgeous work done with wire wrapping and I ma looking forward to using this to join the group of very good artists. Thanks
Home,5.0,Excellent for the price,"Yes, there are more accurate replicas out there. Any time you're dealing with replicas for fans there's going to be a wide range of prices and quality/degree of accuracy. This pin is sturdy, has two pressure back closures, and wears well. I've had it on my messenger bag for several weeks and it hasn't come unpinned despite the fabric being rather thick. It may not pass Starfleet inspection, but it's a wonderful, low-cost fan piece. It would make a great gift for any trekker in your life."
Home,5.0,FOR MY MOM,THIS WAS PART OF A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY MOM WHO LOVES SCARVES AND HAS SO MANY OF THEM. SHE THOUGHT THIS WAS A NICE IDEA AND SHE LIKES IT ANS IS USING IT...NOTHING REALLY MORE TO WRITE OTHER THAN I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED MORE THEN ONE....
Home,3.0,Works as advertised.,"A pain to empty and clean brush. does pick up scraps and dirt, lightweight, easy to push, don't use very often. C.Eves"
Home,4.0,Excellent product,I do wish it could be sized to 3/4 inches. Sometimes I would like to have a smaller one. But the way this products works is excellent. The magnet holds the paper properly for the next area to be punched. The circle is a perfect cut! Love it
Home,5.0,Well Made,"Well made, metal, looks sharp!<br /><br />I was disappointed that Scotty didn't answer me though. I also have a related bruise on my chest...."
Home,5.0,Awesome,Awesome pin for my lab coat.
Home,5.0,Husband enjoying book!!!,My husband is enjoying this book...he says it has a lot of useful information. He reads the book every chance he gets!
Home,5.0,It looks good but I can't get anyone to beam me up.,"I bought this for my daughter, her sci-fi friend all have these.  they look good, all metal and the size looks perfect.  She wears it to school and so far it has never fallen off."
Home,5.0,swivel sweeper,have had this sweeper since it first came out. not one problem. had to replace battery once. very efficient. cleans easily.
Home,5.0,Works well for making e cig coils,"Bought this product with the intention of using it to make Kanthal wire coils for my mods.  I use 28, 30, and 32 gauge kanthal.  I use the two smallest sizes, which allow for both micro and nano coils.  It makes coiling a breeze."
Home,4.0,"Simplehuman Rectangular Step Recycler,","This is a very nice and resistant trash can. The can for regular trash is a little small, and we have to empty it every 1 or 2 days (for a family of 4), but this is not not a big deal. We empty the recycle can every day but I think that depends on how serious you are about recycling. It blocks and isolates odors as it advertises and the silent close lid works perfect! Another very nice feature is the little red switch on the right side that prevents the lid to close without stepping the pedal while you're taking out the trash. Fingerprint proofing is not as good as they advertise, but overall I give it a 4 star."
Home,5.0,great stickers,"I used these to decorate a toybox for my granddaughter for Christmas, it work very well and she loves it."
Home,4.0,BFF loved it!,Bought this for my BFF for Christmas.  Even though it was late she still loved it!!  Super cute and nice quality too.
Home,3.0,Decent,"Cute!  You can write on it, but not as well as I hoped.  Works ok on a smooth surface.  I don't like it to label my Ball jars I use to store my homemade laundry detergent.  The Ball jars don't have a large enough smooth spot for these labels.  At least not the 1 quart jars I got."
Home,4.0,funny,Great calendar for the Dilbert lover in your life.  Just the right size for the desk of your office.  Shipped quick.
Home,4.0,well pleased,Bought this for my brothers birthday.  He enjoys it.  as he loves the Star Trek movies.  He is well pleased.  So am I.
Home,5.0,Love it!,I got one for me and one for my daughter so we can wrap perfect coils for our vape (ecig) equipment. These work great!
Home,1.0,Loses suction easily,Loses suction easily and slows down significantly on carpet. Wouldn't buy again. Battery does not keep charge. Lasts only 3-5 minutes.
Home,4.0,screws,Works amazing. Looks nicely mounted to the wall. The screws they furnished would not have held 8 bottles. I used 2.5 inch wood screws into a stud.
Home,5.0,No more bottles on the counter,"This is a good trashcan. We've had it for awhile without any issues. The trash portion is a bit smaller than a normal kitchen trash can but it should be if you aren't putting anything recyclable in there, right? I love it!"
Home,5.0,Love it,One more step to organizing my clothes in a creative way.  Easy access to scarves and also a unique art piece on the wall of my bedroom.
Home,5.0,Happy boy,"My son loved putting this together, it was bigger than I thought it would be which was a big win with my son. the only thing is, he wished it had more pieces than it did, but all in all a good buy.  It goes great with all his other Star Wars models."
Home,5.0,Beautiful book.,"This is a lovely book.. clear, concise directions, good ideas.  Maybe not exactly what I was looking for but great nonetheless.  Love the pictures."
Home,4.0,rating for pin,"Would have given it a 5 but the retainers that came with it were horrible. They just fell off and would never hold the pin on. After replacing them it stays on fine, I still like it a lot."
Home,1.0,ALL SEVEN DEVICES ARE MALFUNCTIONING,"I have purchased two of these from Michaels previously and love them.  But the ones I ordered on Amazon were malfunctioning.  All of my students using these new devices experienced the wire wrap sticking to the rod.  It was embarrassing!!!  I used WD40 to try and lossen them from the rod with little to no success. HELP!!!! Any ideas on how to prevent this from happening again?  As I said previously, I have two from Michaels that work just fine but what is the material in the rod that it makes the wire wrap stick??? I will have to return these if I can't figure it out."
Home,5.0,Great!,"The product is easy to use, just like they show it in the videos online. It was a good purchase."
Home,5.0,switch the recycling/regular bin,"I too switched the recycling and regular bins. Only pain is that SimpleHuman does not carry size H recycling bags (big bin) and only carries size V (small bin) recycling bags not regular, despite giving them as a free sample when you receive the trash. So you end up using generic brand which anyway saves you many bucks bc Simplehuman bags are outrageously priced."
Home,3.0,Great for a Star Trek fan,i bought this for my dad as a joke and he wore it once and it is currently sitting in a bowl… it comes in a cheap box not like the one showed in the photos  BUT it does look nicely made and very cool.
Home,5.0,Very nice patterns and good origami paper too,"I have found many uses for this paper, so much so, I bought another packet.  It is a really nice set of designs as well as very nice paper for the butterflies and tatos I like to fold."
Home,4.0,Starfleet Badges,"The product is delivered in an attractive hard plastic package. The badge, 3 x 5 cm, is a bit larger than had been expected, but is well made."
Home,2.0,Terrible shipping experience. Twice!,The product is okay. It does what it's suppose to.  But I wanted to give this as a Christmas gift and the way it was wrapped to ship crushed the box to the point it was torn open and pieces were falling out.  The second shipment was also crushed but it looked like all of the pieces were still there so I wrapped it up and apologized for its crushed packaging once opened.
Home,4.0,Great for re-building electronic cigarette coils!,"I purchased this specifically to rebuild coils from my ProTank (a nicotine delivery system for electronic cigarettes), and it works beautifully. The integrated clamp makes it very sturdy."
Home,5.0,Love it!,"My only wish is that it had a slide type pin instead of two stick pins. I want to attached it to my visor and cannot the way it is currently set up. Other than that, I love it!"
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart Crafts Circle Edge Paper Punch Starter Kit,"I haven't use this yet, but a friend of mine has one and she has made some fantastic things. ..."
Home,5.0,A very nice present,"I bought it to give it to a person who already works with paper quilling ans was quite afraid of the book´s content, but the person who received the gift was really surprised by the ideas and information on how to turn them into reality."
Home,5.0,The hottest scarf dress ever. And it's one size fit all!,It's stylist and chic and a nice way to dress up your closet. Clutter free idea and a great gift as well.
Home,5.0,So easy and pretty,This is so easy to use and produces beautiful results.  Now I'm anxious to get more punch designs and put doilies everywhere.
Home,4.0,Purchase as a Christmas gift,Gave to my daughter-in-law for this Christmas along with several glass cannisters and she has beautiful writing so they look lovely on the cannisters.
Home,5.0,Very fast shipping & great stickers!,Love Olof stickers. He's also a decent size and he seems to not come off the wall yet (unlike my Elsa review). The package comes with 2 Olof stickers with different facial expressions. He definitely brightens up the room :D
Home,4.0,Beautiful & fast shipping :),"Beautiful sticker & decent size. However, with my experience, in order to put it on the wall evenly with other parts, I had to touch the wall couple of times and now it seems that it won't hold onto it. I put it on last night and this morning the back of Elsa's dress was almost completely off the wall :("
Home,5.0,Cute,This scarf holder is perfect and holds a lot of scarves the bonus part is the dress design that is has it's very cute.
Home,4.0,Doilies,"I really like making my own doilies.  Great for decorating, cards and scrapbooking...However, it takes some<br />time  getting used to fitting the center of the paper under the magnet.  Once in place it is a easy click to punch and move.<br />I have friends that have skipped buying this item and are purchasing Big Kick or Circuit Doily makers..This is easier for me to take to a friends for a scrap get-to-gether."
Home,5.0,It works,"This is my second swivel sweeper in ten years and II use it everyday.  I thought it would be a waste of money when I bought the first one and was surprised how well it worked on tile floors in the kitchen.  I f you have tile you know how it shows every speck of dirt and is a pain to use a broom..  This sweeper is the cure, at least for me."
Home,4.0,for our r.v.,"now this works good in our camp trailer, and price was good, a broom not much less in price, plus the sweeper is powered, it does a wonderful job, it was a good buy, even does great job around the house.<br />R.W."
Home,5.0,Great crafters product,"Excellent addition to my wife's crafting tools.  She loves it.  Works great.  Not a big fan of Martha Stewart, but like the product."
Home,3.0,Look good once installed,The wires are very poor quality-extremely small and hard to wire.  Somewhat frustrating as crimpers break the wires very easily.
Home,2.0,Swivel Sweeper,"We have a swivel sweeper that was purchase a few years ago.  We loved it.  This one, not so much. Would not purchase another.  The batteries do not hold its charge for very long.  Very disappointing."
Home,5.0,Interaction with Amazon.com-ordering Zentangle.,"I had seen this book at a retail store and found it fascinating,but I couldn't afford their price. I looked on Amazon.com and easily found the book at a lower price. It arrived very quickly after being ordered. it was in excellent condition and I've been enjoying it since. Thanks!"
Home,5.0,Good quality and good looking!,"Love this garbage/recycling can!  We switched the use for each can though -- big for recycling and small for garbage.  This has held up very well over the past two years we've had it -- and with three young kids in the house, that's saying something!"
Home,5.0,Great little device here,I use it to make micro coils for my rebuildable atomizers. It makes perfect coils every time and saves me from having to spend time adjusting.
Home,3.0,Cheesy might be good if you are from Wisconnsin but not if you are looking for Star Trek collectibles,"Bought for my Trekie husband.  Quality was pretty cheesy.  I am not even sure it was made out of metal. Had I looked at it in a store, I would not have purchased it."
Home,5.0,Easy to use!,I love this thing.... No more wrapping wire around odd object to get my swirl on.  It's easy to use and attaches to any flat surface.
Home,5.0,Great Set,"I wanted a simple set of colored pencils to sketch with where I wouldn't have to carry around a separate sharpener.. and here it is! Love the fact that the sharpener is screwed right into the cap.. so all you have to do is twist it off and sharpen (the points don't end up being SUPER pointy.. but its pointy enough). I also love the fact that it comes in a case. The colors of the pencils are great .They are not as waxy as Prismacolors or Faber Castells.. but the quality is still decent (the colors of the lead are as they appear on the pencils, except the green lead has more of an olive color and the blue is on the darker side). The pencils seem very sturdy, as well.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants decent sketching pencils with a built-in sharpener at a great price."
Home,5.0,Really Awesome Tool To Have!,"I absolutely love this product! It is so easy to use, and the work I've already done has turned out amazing! You can really make so much creative wire jewelry that turns out just right each time! If you need more instructions on what to do, they include a link to the creator of this awesome tool. I also was able to find extra visual help from YouTube. It helped me a lot to see how other people use this gadget. I was able to start doing some cool project's right away. I really love this tool. It is a great wire wrapping tool to have, and so easy to use. I do highly recommend this product."
Home,5.0,frozen,Made little girls room great just like Frozen.  She sing Let it Go every night before bed.  Super easy to install.
Home,1.0,Seriously disappointed and will be returning this item,"I love punches and was looking forward to playing with this one.  I was disappointed with the results, it is cumbersome to use and I dislike the die that comes with the base tool.  Spend your money on a nice pretty circle die set."
Home,5.0,Perfect alarm,this was a chrismas gift for my nine year old whom asked santa for an alarm clock. Its very simple and does take batteries that have lasted since christmas. This little guy is not really a clock his an alarm clock. He does tell time but the display is too small to see from across the room. His alarm is loud and my son loves waking up to him in the morning.
Home,2.0,It broke.,I love it so much but it broke a few weeks after I got it. Such a disappointment but I don't want to purchase another in case it'd break again.
Home,5.0,Awesome quality for the price,"I bought this as a gift for my friend that was dressing up as Kirk (and me as Spock) for a costume party and it lived up to my high standards. She loved it and everyone got a kick out of us in our full-on costumes. It was metal and looked exactly as pictured, and wasn't all that expensive either. If I had to give one con about it it would be that the metal was a bit too heavy and weighted down the shirt slightly causing a ripple, but that's just a fussy detail and it's not really noticeable. Overall, I was very pleased with this product and it was exactly what I was expecting/hoping for."
Home,5.0,Awesome,the trash bin is a little smaller than usual bins but it makes up for the fact that now recycling and trash are in one cool looking receptacle.
Home,2.0,Once again.,"I have had several of these, because it's such a good idea to have a portable broom around, just to pick up crums, kitty litter, etc.  I have had three of these, and they have all been cheaply made, and the batteries wear out quickly and cost as much as the unit to replace.  Why have you continued to buy these you may ask.  Because there is a need for this type of item.  I haven't found anything better. I have tried Brissel and Electrolux.  They were both heavy and awkward to use.  Gave them away.  But I won't buy again.  Just drag out the old canister."
Home,4.0,Perfect for my 9 year olds room.,They stick nicely but there are 44 pieces to place.  If your child loves the movie Frozen he/she will love these stickers.
Home,2.0,Not working anymore,"Hate it, through the money to garbage, and couldn't returnt it.........Not working anymore, so i dont know what to do with this."
Home,5.0,Great for preschoolers,I read this to my pre k class when we talk about clouds. It's perfect for them. And Eric Carlie's illustrations are always so beautiful to look at
Home,5.0,Best thing invented since sliced bread!,"I use it daily.  Never buy a jump ring again!  Makes perfect coils for wire wrapping, too.  A must have!"
Home,4.0,Battery dose not last,"I love the sweeper, it cleans good, picks up most every thing, except bird feathers.  Easy to use and very easy to clean."
Home,5.0,nice,The badge came on tine withou missing any pieces.  It wrap nice as if I brought it  at the federation gife shop.
Home,5.0,Excellent,I found that this book provided some very helpful information and made it easy to become creative on my own.
Home,2.0,usually Martha makes a good quality product.,this works well until it gets dill... too expensive for one medium project. I will not buy one of her similar tools.<br /><br />.
Home,4.0,Never Believed Until Now,"I never thought I'd be one of those persons who paid so much (almost $200) for a trash can.  But here I am.  And I am so happy I did.  I've only had this trash ca for a month.  i don't regret this purchase at all.  The trash can is so easy to use, change bags, etc.  and it keeps the smell contained."
Home,4.0,don't expect a long life,"This is working well, just extra work cleaning out the brushes.  It is just what I needed.  Didn't have any problems with the rechargeable battery and when charged stays charged quite a while.  It is what it is, not a vacuum just a light sweeper for crumb-like stuff.  CAD  This would have been a good product if fit you ld have lasted.  It only works for so long and then the battery just dies and the charger does not work.  I bought it in 2014 but didn't think it would be done in 2016.  Wish I knew if there was a neat sweeper out there that has a better lifespan."
Home,5.0,great for vaping applications,handy tool for making coils for my dual coil drippers!! nice consistant nano coils in seconds! works like a champ
Home,5.0,simple and effective sweeper,"I got this to clean my office.  The cleaning crew does the hallway but not the offices unless asked...and even then, it's not that great of a job. I love how well it picks up the tiny bits that the carpet's pattern hides.  It's lightweight and portable so I can disassemble it and take it home if I want."
Home,5.0,Works well,Great product to make coils for my rba's/rda's.  Simple and easy to use.  That is all I have to say.
Home,5.0,I love scrapbooking,I saw this on home shopping network and thought it was just great.  I know it is great now as I have used it several times.  Great product.
Home,5.0,A good thing!,Martha's published crafts are always well-illustrated<br />and have clear directions for completing.<br />A good buy.  Have used it for several occasions.
Home,5.0,Gift for a friend,My friend loves Dilbert! She gets this calendar every year but for some reason she didn't. She looked all over and could not find one. So I went to Amazon and found one. She laughs every morning at work!
Home,5.0,Good pin for us trekkies,"Well made and relatively inexpensive.  A bit heavy, but I hope that means good quality.  My kids love them too."
Home,5.0,I relate to Dilbert,"Scott Adams must work part-time at my company because most of his strips are about what goes on there.<br /><br />These strips are from what was in the newspaper in 2011, but I still laugh at them."
Home,5.0,Love the quality,"It's so nice to have a quality trash can.  I've had it for months now and it's held up very well.<br /><br />cons: the recycle side is too small, not much fits.  The simplehuman liners are expensive (I use regular tall kitchen bags for the trash side).  There's something rough on the inside of the trash side that often rips the bag when it's pulled out.<br /><br />Even with those cons, I love the trash can and recommend it. The quality and look is great. There is a hole in the back of each can, stick the bag liner through the hole and pull, this will tighten the bag around each can.  There's a little switch on the inside that allows the cover to stay open, that's a nice convenience."
Home,4.0,Going on Five Years!,"I bought this product five years ago when it came out on TV. I did the \\""but wait! there's more\\"" and got two of them. I took one to work and kept one at home. Both of them still work like a charm. I still have the original batteries even and they show no signs of wear.<br />It's a great product."
Home,4.0,Works as beautifully as it looks,"Serves it's purpose and looks really cute, my son thought I bought a new dress too.  I wish it had more scarf rings but I can manage to get more than one scarf per ring since most of the scarves are of thin fabric."
Home,5.0,simply elegant,This is very beautiful and brightens up a room. it takes a little while to put the pieces together but it is worth the time and energy.
Home,3.0,Biggie,"I got this along with another order I placed here on amazon. It came nicely packaged. But to my surprise it looked a little.....how can I put this.....BIG. its about half the size of my palm. In the movie they are small and fit perfectly without weight...above the chest to the left. Sadly...this is way to cheap to send back so, I'll keep it. Its ok. Yet not great. Be careful what you hope for."
Home,4.0,good,"These arent quite as big as they look in the picture but still really cute, I will for sure be using them"
Home,4.0,Fantastic Elsa!,"This is a giant, beautiful wall decal.  My daughter adores it.  I would have given it 5 stars except for one flaw and while it's not worth me sending the decal back, it's not perfect.  One side of Queen Elsa's face is not lined up.  Almost like when it was being printed, there was a hiccup in the machine and part of her face juts out.  It's hard to explain.  But it's a definite flaw.  However, everything else is absolutely perfect and beautiful.  So worth the price.  Also, it was surprisingly easy to install."
Home,5.0,Lots of FUN,This is lots of fun.  Easy to use and have fun with. I am looking forward to learning and expanding my wire working with this
Home,5.0,Coolest thing,"Like I said in another review, I thought they would be a little bigger, but other than that, they are great looking, good quality and I couldn't be happier with them."
Home,4.0,Neat,"I like this product a lot. I don't plan on using it for coins. I removed the spring inside and use it for a wide variety of small items I want to keep on my keychain. Sturdy construction, and looks good, too."
Home,5.0,Cute labels!,"Haven't used them yet, bought them for a candy buffet for a child's birthday party and it realized the kids didn't care what was written on the jars.  Will save them for another occassion"
Home,5.0,what's not to love?,My husband is a huge Dilbert fan and loves having this calendar on his desk at work.  Always good for a laugh!
Home,4.0,great gift,"I bought this for my bachelor son.  He is always borrowing mine so this was the next step. He put it together and charged it with ease.<br />He loves it and understands why I didn't like lending it out.  He even purchased additional chargers and batteries, just in case.  Thanks!"
Home,5.0,Fabulous,This a great circle punch....plus you can buy additional style punches for it.<br />Very pleased.  Scrapbooking very easy.  Will recommend.
Home,5.0,EXCELETE,EXCELENTE ME ENCANTO MI CIRCLE EDGE PAPER PUNCH STARTER KIT DE MARTHA STEWART YA COMENZE A USARLO PARA MIS MANUALIDADES
Home,5.0,Princesses,These are adorable. Bought for my grandbaby's room and she loves them. They add a little sparkle to her room and the accents with them are a nice touch!  A good item and I would defintitely recommend for the Princess in your life!!
Home,4.0,LOVE IT!,"After my mom and one of her friends bought theirs, my mom sent me one too. I use it every day on my kitchen tile where my dogs drag in very small leaves and dirt.  This extends into my living room as well.  The sweeper does a FANSTASIC job on both surfaces.  I can't believe the hair it picks up! I use it every day and absolutely love it."
Home,4.0,Good product,These are mostly great- I put them on my jars that I use at Whole Foods to get bulk items. I don't really like the chalk that it comes with but I can write the PLU number on the labels at the store and don't have to use the tags.
Home,3.0,Cordless Sweeper,"It was not as powerful as I thought and did not hold the charge very long,  I like the Shark better."
Home,5.0,Wish I Bought This Years Ago...,"I eventually want to get one of these for each member in my family. It's a bit heavier than one would think but, it's a great piece and I cause smiles when I wear it...thus I wear it proudly :D"
Home,1.0,Swepper not in working order.,"because it cost me 2 times as much as it should have and charger does not hold cahrge was not complete cleaning tool was not with it,  I WILL NEVER USE AMZON AGAIN TO ORDER ANYTHING.  So now i will have to pay 20.00$ FOR A CHARGER SO THAT MAKES IT 80,00$ FOR A SWIVEL SWEEPER , HAD TO PAY YOU 60.00$ FOR SWEEPER & SHIPPING.  THIS IS VERY UPSETTING TO ME.  SO  no more Amazon."
Home,5.0,Awesome,"Easy to apply. Peel and stick. My daughter loves this movie. I applied these in her room while she was with her grandparents and the reaction that I got when she came home and saw them was priceless! &#34;Oh my goodness, oh my goodness! Elsa! Anna!&#34;"
Home,5.0,I love this one!,"It is awesome! I love key-ring stuff and this one is really good, not only for coins but for multipurpose stash. Love it."
Home,1.0,Disappointing build quality,The screw cap pulls out even when low pressure is applied.<br />Not worth the money (paid over twenty). I am looking to return the item and be refunded.
Home,5.0,Darling Labels,"These labels were quite cute.  The package was terrific and came with the labels and their own piece of chalk.  I used a liquid chalk marker to write on my labels for a candy bar I had and it worked fine.  Love the idea of real chalk, but it is more difficult to use and get a good effect than I was willing to giving it.  The shape of the labels was perfect - very cute with different sizes and shapes.  I would definitely order again."
Home,4.0,"Solid badge, but pin clasps a little disconcerting.","I like this badge overall; here is an overview of the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The badge is solid metal; you won't find cheap brittle plastic here.<br />- It looks like the one in the film; dimensions aren't distorted.<br />- Detailed; the back has fine wafer-like texturing to help cling to your clothing<br />- 2 pins help keep the badge secure and aligned.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- If you want to pin this to a really thin shirt, the badge's weight may tug your shirt down.<br />- The clasps wiggle a bit too freely, and may loosen over time.<br /><br />This is the final frontier if you're looking for a good metal badge seen in the 2009 Star Trek film."
Home,5.0,great product,recommend it to anyone and easy to use and for so many different projects. best price in town from amazon
Home,5.0,Great idea,I wanted something I could use to display scarves with instead of just store them. I hung it on a master bathroom hook as a decorative display. Looks great.
Home,3.0,Fun tool.,I must admit this is a fun tool.  I actually had to buy it because I made the mistake and bought one of the cartridges without knowing I had to have this starter kit to get it to work.  My mistake totally.  While I think this is actually a genius idea I'm really not too sure I'll be using it much in my scrapbooking.  The designs really aren't my style.  I can't see dropping any more money into buying other cartridges to go with it.  It's fun but unless you're really into circles it's really not worth the money.
Home,5.0,reusable stickers,These work very well for my purposes on jars in the pantry. They are sturdy and hold up well to re-use
Home,5.0,Great product.,"Had one of these before & it finally wore out.Does a great job as stated.Very timely service.Thanks again,very very much."
Home,5.0,Koh-I-Noor: From Art in Your Hand to Art on the Page,"The Koh-I-Noor mechanical pencil set is well designed and presented. If you appreciate Art as a functional expression, then you might also appreciate that the color-coded pencils are visually attractive nestled in their attractive and convenient case.<br /><br />The grip on the pencils fits your hand easily, however for large handed individuals, the pen-barrel may be small to hold over a long period of time-you might want to add a soft-grip to the barrel.<br /><br />The pencil lead is soft enough to glide easily on the page but firm enough not to lose its point too quickly. The pencil lead colors are very close to the barrel color – I was gladly surprised.<br /><br />The clutch (the thing that propels the lead out of the barrel) works typically: it does not hold the lead as the lead is propelled forward-you have to limit the lead’s travel by holding it just above the desk. Interestingly, when you release the clutch, it draws some of the lead back into the barrel. It just takes some getting used to.<br /><br />These are wonderful tools that work well and are very nice to look at as you give life to your art."
Home,5.0,Super cute!,"These Disney princess room decals are just the right size.  All the little embellishments that come with the princesses - flowers, fairies, etc - are great.  And the stick on gems are adorable.  My daughter had a great time decorating with them and they stick on nicely.  Sticky enough to stay up, not so sticky that you can't remove them later."
Home,3.0,Great for the first 20 uses,"It's a great punch, beautiful design, but I found that after the first 20 or so uses that it started to punch less crisply, and any paper slightly thicker it left fuzzy edges on each punch out."
Home,4.0,Not bad,I bought this to wrap micro coils after watching a YouTube video tutorial that suggested it.  I have not been disappointed.
Home,1.0,DO NOT BUY,"I've had this sweeper for a few months, but only use it on occasion on my kitchen floor for crumbs, like once a day.  I've always followed the instructions regarding the battery.  I was really impressed at first, but as the battery started not doing so well, I started trying to recharge it per directions.  The recharge procedure just only gave me minimal power.  Recently I just wore down the battery thinking that a full recharge would be the answer.....NOT.  It's deader that a doorknob, as my mom used to say.  Please do not buy this product."
Home,5.0,Look Great,"I stuck these on the speaker grills of my Stern Star Trek pinball game...they look great, and like they are factory installed."
Home,5.0,Very cute,Olaf looks great in our &#34;Frozen&#34; room!  We also got the large decals of the sisters and the glittery snowflakes
Home,5.0,Love this book!,"Similar to the book looks like spilled milk!  Clouds change shapes.  Can read the book and make observations about the clouds and record in science journals, during different cloud patterns."
Home,5.0,LOVE THESE!,These are very cute! smaller than I expected but they will work just fine. I like that they are reusable :)
Home,5.0,Girls love it,"Easy to apply, to adjust and to move.....perfect size.....bright and looks very durable..... and the girls love it  would recommend"
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart comes through again,"Martha Stewart Crafts comes up with really nifty gadgets that one would think are totally frivolous, but nevertheless create such beautiful results. This circle edger can be fitted with an array of different patterns to make small to big circles, it's a very clever device.  Let me warn you, it is a little tricky to get the paper exactly centered, so I made a template for each size of paper and opened a tiny hole in the center of the template. Then I get a pencil and lightly mark the center on my paper. I place the magnet center on the little dot and play around with it for a few seconds until the magnet clicks into place in the unit, nicely centered. After I finish the circle I erase the little dot, and voila. I hope this helps you because it's hard to center it with the naked eye. I use it not only to make banners and scrapbooking, but I also use it to make doilies for desserts and drinks. If you like tea parties, like me, you can certainly find a lot of uses for this circle maker."
Home,5.0,BEWARE! This thing is addictive!!,"Ingenious design to easily and quickly make various size decorative circles. Compact footprint doesn't take up too much storage space. Nice selection of additional punches are available on Amazon. This punch is so much fun to use, I found myself experimenting with papers of different textures, sizes, and colors just because I didn't want to stop!"
Home,5.0,Thor rocks!,"Yes this movie is packed with a good story and more hammer smashing action. It picks up where the Avengers movie left off, in a different realm of course, with Loki imprisoned for his actions on earth and the rise of the dark elf ruler who is the new adversary to hit back at Asgard, Thor must face off with that faction. Natalie Portman plays a stronger role in this also and she is great. I believe that Thors hammer in this movie is twice the size as compared in the first movie. That's massive!"
Home,5.0,2 for the price of 1,Was very pleased and surprised to have two in the package... They look awesome where we've placed them.  Truly cool.
Home,4.0,Cool Tool,"This is a really cool tool for winding wire. It is easy to use and works well. I've only made a few things with it so far, but am excited to try more!"
Home,5.0,Question,"I just bought the Elsa, Olaf, and Anna wall decals.  What color combos would you suggest in the room?  I was thinking powder blue and white."
Home,5.0,Great product,"This  is a particular good item for me, since I had a back injury many years ago, sometimes using a regular broom will aggravate the back, this is handy and does the job."
Home,5.0,Martha Stewart Circle Paper Punch Kit,This is the best little invention for scrapbooking and card making.  Makes beautiful perfectly punched circles.  There is a very nice variety of cartridges to fit any style.  The kit comes with the lace doily punch.  I'm really happy with this buy.
Home,5.0,Love It,I did my daughter's room in Frozen.  Love the Elsa my favorite even though it took alot of patience to put up.

Home,5.0,swivel sweeper review,I love this item. Had one before but when the battery died I had no idea you could get a replacement so I threw it out. Now I know. I am disable and it is so great because it's lightweight and easy to handle even from a sitting position if needed.
Home,3.0,swivel sweeper,It's ok--the sweeper is for my Mother--it's not a vacumn cleaner but does the job it's supposed to do..I hope that helps
Home,3.0,Over priced,You need to look for this somewhere else.  I was just too lazy to go to the store and pick one up.
Home,4.0,great for a dorm room,Got this for my daughter for her dorm room.  She says it works great and is so much easier than lugging the big vacuum around.  It is great for everyday sweeping up and lightweight too.
Home,5.0,easy tool,"Great Tool For My Jewelery Projects.  Super Easy To Use.  Makes Great Coils, Different Sizes, Good for Gold Or Silver"
Home,1.0,missing instructions,Pieces missing and no instructions inside box. Box smashed inside box. Didn't know how to use it and then I cut my finger on sharp edge
Home,3.0,A word of advice,"This gadget does what it shows on the box - and therein lies the word of advice . . . .  The description of the item says it includes instructions - but the only instructions are actually the pictures on the box, so keep the box for future reference!<br /><br />I ordered this item from Amazon, and it duly arrived, but in a very battered and squashed box.  The 5 crank rods were present, but the U-bracket was in pieces, one of the screws was missing and there was no sign of any instructions.  I assumed the instructions were missing in view of the other problems.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon Customer Service, who immediately arranged the delivery of another Gizmo.  The next unit - again in a rather battered box - had a properly assembled U-bracket, 5 crank rods, but no instructions.  It then dawned on me that the instructions mentioned on the list of contents, namely 1 U-bracket with built-in mount, 5 crank roads, Instructions - had to be the pictures printed on the box!<br /><br />Perhaps I should have been tipped off by the 'Econo' included in the title on the box, but not in the title on Amazon.<br /><br />After several attempts, and lots of wasted wire, I got the hang of it, but proper instructions and some tips would have been so helpful.  You have been warned!"
Home,5.0,Live Long And Prosper,This is a must for all star trek fans! The badge seems sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. I bought this for a friend and he wore it to work today and people were asking him where he got it. It looks like the real thing!
Home,5.0,Functional and cute! Love this!,Love this! It appears like a very unique dress but it has all my favorite scarves.  I would buy this again.
Home,4.0,Completed the Costume,So I bought this Star Trek Commander's uniform that had a cheesy iron on patch. I needed something that 'looked' commanding. This Prop was perfect. Now I look like the Treckie geek that I have always wanted to look like . . . very cool!
Home,1.0,Not good,"Blows,... Not helpful at all, cheaply made,  bought it for making could for my mods, an nothing was helpfully, waste if money"

Home,2.0,returned :-(,"we ordered this cordless SwiveSweeper and did hope to be able to use it daily.<br />The TV demo was absolutely persuading.<br />Unfortunately we had to return it because it is equipped with batteries, a battery loader and a motor designed for use in the USofA, where outlets provide 110V. In all of Europe outlets give 220 V.<br />But this was NOT mentioned in the promotion of this product.<br />Also we were instructed how to return it, which we did,but still do not know if it also is available with European standards :-)<br />Thanks for an answer."
Home,3.0,lights,lights are good and bright but the wires are really bad small wire very head to work with but from that thay are really good but bad tape but that anit the lights fiet
Home,4.0,i enjoy this little thingy,its cheap its plastic but runs a year on its bateries already and is a fun gimmick bit cheapy in the plasticky feel but hey
Home,1.0,A Curmudgeon review,"This thing works great if you use a broom and dust pan and physically put that dirt into the sweeper!  When you push it on carpet, it flips over.  If one uses it on an uncarpeted floor, it throws the dirt everywhere and will get some of it if you push it against the wall, if the dirt is there.

Home,5.0,Five Stars,thanks for nice book and transaction--
Home,1.0,Complete waste of my money.,In a sense I am glad I purchased this product. It is such a poor product it has cured me from being tempted to ever purchase anything but books online. I don't have the time or inclination to try to repackage it. I should have known I was going to have problems when I didn't even get instructions. Actually the  poor quality was an even better tip off. I will stick to the bricks and mortar stores where you can easily return things from now on.
Home,2.0,won't last long,"I bought this product (the Swiffer Sweeper) and received it yesterday. I read the instructions and the reviews and charged the batteries exactly 8 hours. I timed it because both the reviews and the instructions indicated that it matters. Then I tried it out.<br /><br />It is like a broom with an automatic dustpan. It sweeps stuff up and into the little tray, but has no suction whatsoever. If you expect it to act in any way like a vacuum, you will be disappointed. I didn't, as I had already seen my aunt's in action.<br /><br />Her model is a few years old, and mine is not the same. The two tabs you squeeze to empty the tray on hers very conveniently releases it from a hinged side, and after shaking out the stuff you just push it shut again and you're ready to go. What I just bought releases the whole tray which drops into the trash where you must fish it out, turn it over and empty it, and then aim it back and push to click it into place. The directions on how to do it say to put it flat on the floor, squeeze the release tabs, remove the sweeper, pick up the tray and empty, place it back on the floor, and then aim the sweeper and push down until you hear the click of it going back into place. The lack of ease and convenience in emptying is a big negative on my list of attributes.<br /><br />Next, I ran it around my kitchen. I have 3 cats so cat hair and dust bunnies are a big problem. The sweeper did a good job of getting it all up. A positive on my list.<br /><br />I decided to empty it before moving on. The cat hair mostly had wound around the various shafts and brushes. I used the seam ripper they provide, and got the stuff out but it was not quick and easy. This is a negative on my list. I believe it is because there is no suction to direct the hair so it wraps around.<br /><br />I went to the bathroom next and tackled the crumbs and grit from the litterbox, another issue with 3 cats. I use the clumping litter which has a finer grain than standard litter, so I amreporting on the finer grit, not the heavier standard grit litter. It picked it up beautifully. A positive on my list.<br /><br />However, before I got it run around the whole bathroom and the master walk in closet, it slowed almost to a stop. At first I thought it was the battery malfunctioning, but after I cleaned it out again and let it sit, it was back up to speed. Apparently the tray is small enough that I will have to stop partway thru to empty it. I know that three cats is a lot, but that seems just too small to me. A negative on my list. Perhaps if emptying it was easy and convenient it wouldn't seem like such a big deal. Fussing with that tray is irritating.<br /><br />Again, I had to use the seam ripper tool and work the cat hair out when I emptied it.<br /><br />All in all, the sweeper would be okay for someone to use on hard floors, who didn't have much animal hair to cope with, who doesn't mind fishing in the trash to get the tray back and onto the broom, and who doesn't have much dirt/hair/litter crumbs to sweep up.<br /><br />Addendum after about 6 months use: the battery won't hold a charge. i read all the info about the batteries, and how charging them too soon or for too long would shorten their life. i was obsessive about that, as i wanted to keep it functioning for a long time. i let the battery run out each time, and i set a timer and charged it for 7 hours each time. the instructions that came with said 6-8 hours, so i selected the middle and timed it, every single time. it is dead and won't hold even a small charge. what a ripoff. my considered opinion after using this unit is don't waste your money unless you don't mind replacing the battery every few months. given that batteries in other devices of all sorts manage to last more than 6 months or less, i think this may be a planned thing on the manufacturer's part to ensure a continuing revenue stream."

Pros:  solid construction, attractive stainless steel, sortable bins, and the fact that the bag ties are neatly secured around the edges.  The only cons are the price, and I would like a bigger recycling area since most of our recyclables (mail, plastic bottles, milk cartons) are bulky.  I saw that many people switch and use the blue for trash and larger area for recycling.  This is a pretty good solution."

Home,5.0,Best Sweeper,"My husband saw this sweeper on a TV ad and bought it - I absolutely love this lightweight but powerful sweeper!!  It totally picks up any crumbs, hair, or even dust from my hard surface floors and low pile carpet.  Easy to empty and store, plus it's cordless - just a small rechargeable battery that I plug into a socket in my kitchen.  Very handy for quick clean-ups so I don't have to take out my larger vacuum.  Recommend this sweeper to everyone."

Home,5.0,Five Stars,Great sweeper. I highly recommend. It's works on both hardwood and throw rugs.
Home,5.0,For the vapor people.,This makes perfect micro coils and it's so simple to use. I use the second smallest rod and do 6-7 wraps (28 gauge wire) and use sterile cotton.  I use a single coil drip atomizer and it end up being 1.2-1.4 ohms. This means you can use it on your little ego twist battery's. You won't believe the clean tasty vapes you can get with this simple set up. Make sure your air hole is drilled out on your cap for good air flow. Changing flavors is as simple as changing cotton.
Home,1.0,One Star,Ok
Home,5.0,Great for hobbyists and vapers alike!,"Great tool for the vaping crowd, as well as the jewelry hobbyist.  In our household, I use it to make coils out of A1 Kanthal for my RDA, RBA, as well as making replacement coils for the Protanks.  For those interested in using it for vaping purposes, I'd suggest torching the Kanthal first, to make it easier to get it in the shape you want.<br /><br />My daughter uses it to make rings and other jewelry for her and her friends.  She makes long coils with thinner wire first, then wraps those into larger coils that are pretty cool looking<br /><br />It is very simple to use.  Clamp it to the table, select the proper sized mandrel, which is supplied, insert the mandrel, wrap a bit of the wire around the handle, apply some tension to the wire and start cranking the handle.  You will always get uniform and precise coils with this device."

But the instructions that are available are confusing and seem to leave out steps.<br /><br />I would love for someone to let me know what book I should try to get started.

Would be great if this company offered other rod diameters targeted to the E-cig community, such as 5/64&#34; or 1/8&#34;, but I realize that they are marketing for the jewelry craft (for now).  This thing saves me a ton of time and I find myself building a supply of coils at a time now."

Solution is to put the can 1-2 inches from the wall, so that you can really just stomp the step and get it instant open.<br /><br />Quality is very high, with many details cared for like a small internal stand for the bins when you're changing the liner. Oh and if you're getting this, then obviously use the proprietary liners and you'll feel like luxury while doing the trash. A couple are included, and they're not crazy expensive in bulk."

Home,5.0,Cool process for Stamp and Cut -- WORKS!,"I actually like this mat better than the original mats I've used... and it is a favorite of one of my personal students too.  I'll be introducing this PixScan feature to the entire class in the next couple of weeks, and I'm very excited about it.  I've really enjoyed this feature.  Thank you, Silhouette for making this available for us and on Amazon.com too!  The only reason I can figure out why people would not like this is if they aren't using it properly... and I'll have to admit, it was difficult to &#34;get&#34; it because, at first, there wasn't much in the way of tutorials or instruction.  I haven't looked lately, but I hope Silhouette is doing a better job at this because the technique is well worth having -- if you know how to calibrate your camera. I never did figure out how to calibrate my scanner.  It never did do right... and I'm a techno geek.  But, the saving grace was the ability to calibrate my camera(s).  With this, I've been able to photograph my 8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34; stamped cardstock on the PixScan Mat and cut the stamped images out precisely using the upgraded version of the Silhouette Design Studio software.  You have to be sure to upgrade your computer as well.  It is an easy process once these two things are done:  Calibrate camera and upgrade computer with Silhouette Design Software version 3.1.417.  I have not found the need to buy the Designer version since I have Sure Cuts A Lot and can manipulate SVG files with it and also do the Rhinestone features and more, but my students are enjoying the Designer edition of the software.  I would have bought it if I had needed it.  You don't need the upgraded Designer program in order to do this PixScan technique. I had figured out a way to stamp and cut without PixScan, but it was a drawn out process.  This PixScan made the task much easier.  I hope this helps!"

Home,5.0,Five Stars,Use it to make atomizer coils
Home,5.0,It was so nice to have this new feature available to me,I got my new PixScan this weekend. I stamped an intricate image and then cut it out. It was so nice to have this new feature available to me. I love it!
Home,4.0,too cute!,Very cute! Only complaint is one of the rings was coming off out of the box!
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Love these little suckers..Don't change a thing.
Home,3.0,Good to use infrequently. not much recommended for heavy duty punching,"Love this paper punch from MS. Just that after using it for a couple of times (25 times), I noticed that the punch bar keeps slipping even with the slightest touch. This creates problem in maintaining a regular size for the doily mat."
Home,5.0,Five Stars,"EXCELLENT, THANK YOU!"
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Great for making coils for vaping....if anyone wants to know lol....
Home,4.0,Makes Great Coils for My Mod,Works like a charm for coiling my mod!
Home,4.0,"Solid, but needs magnets :)",I wish it had a magnetic clasp instead of pins. I always worry about damaging fabric. Solid construction though!
Home,4.0,"Cutting/ Scan area only 8.5 x 11.5"" A4 size only.",luv I can now stamp or scan any pcs of  scrap tat i wish to cut out! cool! The mat is 12&#34; but not the scan area! its only 11.5 x 8.5&#34; like A4 only. so means it wont fit any 12x12&#34; cardstk! hope it helps!
Home,2.0,I even heard reviews that said the new versions were terrible with this problem but the original didn't suffer from ...,"I should have heeded the other reviews about the length of power supply from the battery.  High rotation speed from the brushes dramatically reduces after about 30 seconds of use, shifting to a speed about half as fast for an additional couple of minutes.  I thought I was safe because I was going to give the battery a proper initial charge as one should to get quality performance for the life of the battery.  NOPE.  I even heard reviews that said the new versions were terrible with this problem but the original didn't suffer from it.  NOPE.  Stay away.  I guess the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I can't build one myself."
Home,3.0,More Adjustabiliy Would Be Great!,"Would have been nice if the bottle neck grommets rotated so you could use this as a single wide bottle rack.  As it stands it is a double wide rack as every other grommet only supports every other bottle horizontally.  If you want to use this in a limited space as a single wide rack, it will only hold 4 bottles.  Instructions were sparse.  Mounting using brackets and set screws is needlessly over complicated."
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Works as expected
Home,5.0,Five Stars,"verry pleased with my item,"
Home,5.0,Convenient and Painless Companion For Your RDA,"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, building coils for my mechanical mod. I've gotta say, it's the most painless solution I've found yet.<br /><br />I haven't seen mentioned yet, though, that you're also going to need a small machine screw, washer, and wingnut to be able to hold your Kanthal in place while wrapping. I took a trip to the hardware store and found that #6-32 hardware fits perfectly - MAKE SURE to grab this, as this gizmo isn't going to wrap nice tight coils reliably without it.<br /><br />The bars all fit common coil sizes pretty accurately. I found I use the bar that matches 1/8&#34; and 1/16&#34; the most, and once wrapped, the coils will fit on their respective drillbits to position while mounting them on your RDA.<br /><br />Construction is solid for a $10 item - I haven't damaged anything yet, even though I do apply some considerable force to make sure my coils are wrapped tight.<br /><br />Does its job, and I definitely recommend this to anyone using a rebuildable atomizer."
Home,1.0,Wouldnt Fit,These will only fit very large jars. And they have to have a flat surface to stick. My apothecary jars I wanted them for are oval or curved shape. SO I couldnt fit them on there properly.

Home,4.0,Decent little Gizmo,I use this to recoil my vape mods. Makes things a little easier as I can use it sort of like a Helping Hands device which allows my hands to be free in order to coil my Kanthal wire around my wicks.
Home,5.0,Great Gizmo,"I received mine today in good working order. The box was slightly crushed because Amazon shipped it in a flat book package but it was not damaged. I have made coils by hand before for wire jewelry and I regret not getting this sooner. It makes coils so quicky and evenly, and it's very reasonably priced. The pictoral instructions give you the general idea of how to orient it, and if that's not enough search coiling gizmo on youtube for all kinds of instructions and projects. The variety of crank rods give you a good range of sizes, listed accurately by other reviewers as well as on the artisticwire.com website. The built in mount works to hold it securely. I know I sound like a commercial already, but I have no relationship to the company. I'm looking forward to trying some projects."
Home,5.0,Five Stars,super happy with my purchase :D
Home,5.0,Awesome,Awesome!
Home,5.0,Great for rebuilderbilds.,"This product is as advertised, If you new to rebuilding and winding your own  coils  this is just what the doctor ordered, also great for the Pro making several coils at time, quick and easy to use. Will mount anywhere. I put rubber padding on the top & bottom & side of the mount so not to scratch any thing I attach the winder too. Great price for a great product. I told all of my vaping friends about this product. Don't forget to check coils ohms before installing on your power supply.... Vape Safe, Vape Happy."
Home,4.0,I bought it to make coils for my ecigs and it seems to work just fine.,I ordered this product on a friday and it was in my hands by the following Tuesday. I bought it to make coils for my ecigs and it seems to work just fine.
Home,4.0,kind of small and not super functional,this is a nice garbage and recycle combination bin. however because they are combined it makes both sections a bit smaller than I would like. You also need to buy expensive garbage bags specially man by simplehuman to fit the recycle bin perfectly.
Home,5.0,Five Stars,good
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Its just perfect and it's so cute!
Home,5.0,Great for mechanical vaping atomizer builds,Love it. Use it for building my mechanical e-cigarette wire and it's awesome.
Home,3.0,"For vaping? no, not really","I tried to use this for vaping with no luck, few sizes are usable for this purpose, the rods are unwieldy and you some kind of support/table to do properly. I'm way better off with a regular coil jig."

Home,5.0,Five Stars,interesting gizmo!
Home,5.0,Love these!!!,The labels are so cute and fit perfectly.  I make my own lotion sticks that I put into empty deodorant containers and the labels look amazing on the white containers.  The shapes fancy them up and make my products look fancier than they really are.  I didn't like the chaulk it did not look that great so I bought a silver Sharpie and they look great.  Definately will be purchasing these again closer to Christmas when I make the lotion bars as Christmas gifts for family members.
Home,5.0,love,so cute.  love it
Home,2.0,A great idea.  Just doesn't work that well.  :(,"The PixScan cutting mat is a great idea, but the reality is disappointing.  In theory you place the sheet of printed objects on the PicScan mat and take a photo.  The Software reads the photo and magically it knows where every printed object is. You place the cutting area round the objects and the Cameo cuts object out, perfectly.  Not so.  Many times the software is unable to detect the registration lines, but if it does then the Cameo itself can't detect them.  Very frustrating spending the evening trying to get this thing to work.  Save your money."
Home,4.0,Poor support for a great idea,Works fairly well when you can finally figure it out.  Silhouette's support of this item is really lacking.
Home,5.0,Great and Light Weight for Someone who does not like Heavy Vacuum Cleaner,Got it as Christmat gift for my mom last year. She is 82 years old and does not like heavy vacuum cleaner. This Sweeper handles majority of sweeping for her so it does not take much to clean after that. Still no complaints after one year.
Home,4.0,Happy Cutting made a little easier,This is going to be a great tool to use with my Cameo.  I haven't used it yet but can see it is of good quality. I've read reviews and watched You Tube vids to know some of the issues and limitations.  All in all a good if not perfect solution with my much loved Silhouette Cameo

Home,5.0,Great picker-upper,"This is my second swivel sweeper.....yes, they wear out and in this case the battery wouldn't hold a charge.....but I use it every single day and it's been a lot of years....must be nearly 10 years.  We just put down laminate floors and this sweeper picks up crumbs and incidental 'stuff' in a jiffy.  Someone knocking on my door and I spy some lint, etc. on the floor I can have it picked up with my sweeper before I get to the door to say hello.  What will I do if this one also wears out 10 years down the road?????  If they still manufacture them, I will purchase another one!!!"
Home,5.0,Perfect way to identify the candy at the wedding candy bar.,We needed to identify the candy in the jars for the wedding candy bar.  These were perfect and went well with the other decor we had already made.  Easy to remove and write on.

Home,3.0,Not too excited about this one...,"The product is confusing, with so many pieces and confusing instructions. Do not buy for wrapping coils for a mod! This is a product for jewelry making. Using this to wrap coils for a vaporizer will cause you to use much more wire than necessary."
Home,1.0,too bad,Really disapointed with the swival sweeper! Wanted something light weight & easy for my kids to help clean with. Like everything about it except the battery life. Only got about 15-20uses out of it & now the battery will not hold a charge.
Home,1.0,One Star,Battery only lasted three charges - then wouldn't hold a charge
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Great!
Home,5.0,DIY creative.,Chock fulll of ideas.
Home,1.0,I would really like a replacement but,"I purchased this sweeper in August and by November, it stopped working. After you charge it and try to use it, it just stops and doesn't do anything. Even when it's fully charged. I would really like a replacement but, no returns available and it's over 30 days. Last time I will purchase anything that's &#34;As Seen On TV&#34; mail order again!"
Home,3.0,Only if you really need it...,Works decently enough.  I thought an extra one would help guide my Roomba around more smoothly.  It did not help at all.
Home,5.0,Wonderful quick cleaner.,I love it!  Have an older one and bought these for my daughters. So quick and easy to clean up my vinyl floor.  Works on smoother carpets but uses lots of battery.
Home,5.0,Five Stars,as described
Home,5.0,Perfect for wrapping coils for rebuildable atomizers!,"I use this device for wrapping coils on rebuildable atomizers and it's great, it makes a perfect tensioned micro-coil (or whatever diameter) every-time. For anyone wanting to use this for rebuilding atomizers, there are a few extra things you'll need to trap the kanthal. That being some 6'32 size screws, washers, and wing-nuts. Honestly, anything 6' in diameter should work just fine for these rods.<br /><br />Additionally, if your looking to use the gizmo for these purposes, here is an excellent in-depth video that shows the correct way to use this device: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XLIHmm5p2Y&list=UULWoUhjf61yHLlCuRfOHPuQ&index=12"
Home,5.0,Increases my creativity,"I love this product!!!  I am using it to make my Christmas cards this year, it just lets my creativity come to life!!!"
Home,4.0,"Great idea, saves paper","This mat is such a better alternative to the Print & Cut feature. You do not waste any of your paper printing registration marks because they are part of the mat. It is very easy to use.. you just put the paper you want to cut in the box, take a picture of the entire mat, import the picture into Silhouette Studio, and use the Trace feature to get the cut outline. You do need good lighting and a decent camera to get a good solid trace. One downside is that the max cut area is only large enough to fit 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; paper."
Home,5.0,Neat invention,Works great!
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Nice item at a fair price.  Works well.

Home,4.0,I'm satisfied with my purchase,"I'm satisfied with my purchase. I got the program to sort of work on the first try (though I referenced a lot of youtube videos first). I think it helps if you can take a straight-on shot as level a you can in good even light. My angle was slightly off kilter and the program shifted the cutting to the right just a little bit. (Also, it helps if you choose to add some wiggle room to your cuts vs cutting as close to the edge of your designs as some tutorials show.)"
Home,5.0,Five Stars,Sweet
Home,3.0,Frustratingly Small Recycle Bin,"The recycling bin is annoyingly small.  Because it is so narrow items stack on top of each other making the bin too small to hold much and we are constantly emptying it.  We empty it 3-4 times as often as the trash.  Another inch or two of width would have made it much more usable.  Also, if you plan to use a bag in the recycling bin it's even worse.<br /><br />That said, the trash is wide enough to scrape food scraps from cutting boards and the like into and the lid lock has survived our young kids for the last year plus.  The plastic lock will give way instead of breaking, which is great.  I put a small block of wood behind our to help with the banging, but it still happens.<br /><br />The crevasses in the top take a bit of extra cleaning every now and again.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't buy it again - I think I'd opt for 2 cans so we aren't emptying the recycling bin so often."
Home,5.0,still looking for the best way to secure the wire when wrapping the coils,"Product arrived on time and everything was included in the box as described.

Home,3.0,but I HATE it. The recycling bin is too small for ...,"I can't fault the construction of the thing, but I HATE it.  The recycling bin is too small for a 2-person household (2 adults) and not big enough to handle trash unless you want to change it almost daily (only a slight exaggeration).<br /><br />Quality is good, but it is annoying that they lock you into their trash bags -- I've been using regular branded trash bags (hefty, I think) and they get the job done, but obviously don't fit like they're supposed to and can be seen around the edges even when the lid is closed.<br /><br />I give it a 3-star review because it's good quality, but I personally can't stand the design.  Perhaps it will work for you, but really think about how darn small that recycling bin is.  I've been thinking about it for the past 3 months!"

Home,5.0,For putting boundaries on your Roomba 800 series,"We have a new Roomba 880 and it is doing a great job cleaning our living room, which is why we bought it.  However, our rooms are more cluttered than most with furniture, bird cages, and the like, and there are several areas where we do not want our Roomba to go (behind the TV for example, where there are lots of wires that can screw Roomba up).  You can use  these Virtual Wall Lighthouses as lighthouses or more as virtual barriers to put boundaries on Roomba and prevent it from going where it should not.<br /><br />The virtual lighthouse function works fine.  If I put the VWL as a boundary into the kitchen (which adjoins the living room, where Roomba lives) and put it in Lighthouse mode, Roomba will also clean the kitchen.<br /><br />If you have a Roomba, how many of these devices you need will depend on your room configuration.  Very happy that we added a third VWL.  RJB."

When I purchased the lighthouses I did need to reset all lighthouses so Meesh would &#34;see&#34; them all. EVEN THOUGH the lights turn on and it looks like they are operating like normal!<br /><br />Simply take the batteries out and replace them while your iRobot is on it's docking station. One lighthouse at a time, no extended time is needed with the batteries out. Just take them out and replace. Then move on to the next lighthouse. Once all batteries have been removed and replaced, start your iRobot and everything should be liked appropriately."

The punch blade is not sharp at all, many tiny circles in this punch pattern remain in their places, I had to remove papers from those tiny cut circles by adding a little cut using a paper cuter.  It is also hard to look for another punch in all craft store, all punches are so pricey."

Home,4.0,My son says it's the coolest alarm clock ever,"My 8 year old son is MAD about Star Wars.  This gift has him excited.  When visitors come, I ask myself why he has taken them into our kitchen walk-in pantry.  Turns out it is a window-less room and perfect to demonstrate the light-up time on the wall or ceiling.    The noises are cool.  There is a button to press to hear the noises on demand.  R2 has a little repertoire that we all enjoy.  He beeps once softly on the hour, every hour, he tries to wake you at the alarm-set time.  There is an option to have the alarm off.  He looks great on a bed-side table.  Or anywhere.  Good for collectors, too.    So he is a clock, and not much use except for telling the time and waking you. And looking good.  It's not a toy, and having accepted this, my son loves it.  R2 is a great novelty for my son and he compares the digital time on R2 to an analogue clock also in his room.  The screen for reading the time is small, so you won't be checking out the time from across the room.  But on the bedside table, my son finds the numeral sizes are not an issue for him when he is in bed.    He's had it since early December 2014 and I'm waiting for the novelty to run out.  Hasn't happened yet."

Home,5.0,SO GLAD I ordered this!!!,"This mat literally SAVED MY HIDE!!  I've been wanting a Cameo for years, and after taking on the task of helping my best friend create her baby's first birthday party theme and decorations, I finally had a reason to get one!  I thought surely I'd be able to figure it out and use it for what I needed, but unfortunately, being so new to the machine and software, what I needed to do was so simple that it ended up being hard, lol, and I did not have much time to work with.  The tutorials I was able to find online were all WAY above what I needed to do right away (someday, though...) and I ended up spending 2 completely sleepless nights trying to figure out how to make the simplest things possible, and only realized at absolute crunch time that I'd gone about it all completely the wrong way from the beginning, since I was using a design package that my friend had chosen from a website and not a Cameo design.  The PixScan Mat was an Amazon suggestion at the time I bought the machine, and after watching the Cameo video, I thought it looked really cool and went ahead and added it to my order.  As I sat in the wee hours of this precious baby's birthday trying to figure out how I was going to undo all of my hours of incorrect work and get the things I needed to cut to actually go through the Cameo and cut (not something I could've just done with scissors!), it finally occurred to me, I had the PixScan Mat!  I whipped out my cell phone and snapped a pic of one of the million sheets of uncut card stock I had here and crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  It WORKED, and it was SO SIMPLE!!!  I had gotten so frustrated before that point, I actually went to my husband in TEARS of relief to show him my perfectly cut card stock that I was FINALLY able to accomplish with the PixScan Mat!  So, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!  You not only saved me, but you saved one sweet little baby girl's very first birthday party, too!!  I look forward to learning the machine better and being able to do all of the amazing things that I saw in the MANY tutorials that I watched, but, being such a newbie and needing to do something right away with the machine like that, I am SO GLAD that I added the PixScan Mat onto my order, and I can't wait to see what else I can do with it, too!  Seriously, how COOL is it to be able to just snap a pic with your cell phone and then create?  Also, since I ordered the Cameo kit, I actually got two of their regular mats, and I have to say, I MUCH prefer the texture and stickiness (it's sticky enough to hold the materials in place well, but they come off SO much easier and I didn't need any tools to peel everything off the mat like with the clear ones... also, there were no teeny bits of card stock residue left behind on it afterward like I'm STILL having to try to peel off of the clear ones) of the PixScan Mat over the original ones, and I ran it through my machine about a million times that night/morning and it's still in perfect condition, so it must be pretty darn durable, and I can definitely see myself using that one a lot more than the others whenever possible.  A GREAT concept, a GREAT product, and WHEW, am I glad I added THAT THING onto my order when I did, because I really don't know what I would've done without it in this situation!  Thanks SO much for selling such a wonderful product and getting it to me so quickly... I had left it in its wrapping thinking it would be something fun to play around with at some point in the future, but I was in SO much trouble and so desperate to get the items made that I had promised my friend for that party, and I looked over in my panic and exhaustion and saw it sitting there and thought, &#34;That is literally my ONLY hope to get any of this to work in time,&#34; and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  It was also so easy to use, my fried, tired brain had NO trouble figuring it out and I was able to get what I had been attempting to do for 2 days to happen perfectly in just a matter of minutes.  Not only that, but I ended up making even MORE items for the party than I originally intended because it was so fun and easy and quick to use once I got going!  Thank you SO much for bailing me out of a REALLY tough spot and also making the birthday party a beautiful success!  I can't wait to explore what all I can do with this mat now just for fun!  :)er of minutes.  Not only that, but I ended up making even MORE items for the party than I originally intended because it was so fun and easy and quick to use once I got going!

Home,3.0,NOT IF YOU RECYCLE!!!,"We've had one for a couple of years.  It holds up well. No problems getting bags in or out.    For the first year after getting it, when the recycle side filled up, we'd empty it by hand into paper bags so as not to tear through our supply of recycle bags.  It finally got to the point where we stopped using the recycle side and put our recycle directly into the paper bags we keep on the landing to the basement.    Why give it any stars?  Well, we recycle.  We have weekly trash and recycle collections and it frosts me to have to discard a 13 gal trash bag that's only half full (or less) when trash day rolls around or leave the garbage sitting in the can for another week.  Like I said, we recycle. What piles up more that the plastic bags from...everywhere (drug store, supermarket, any place that sells merchandise)?  I discovered that the typical store bag can be folded over the lip of the can to be used as a garbage bag.  (Okay, use the big bag if you're cleaning up after a full turkey dinner, but otherwise...) See photo.  If we use one tall bag per month,it's a lot."
Home,3.0,"Works well, just not for RDA","It works very well for wrapping artistic wire.<br />But I don't wrap artistic wire. I bought it for making coils for RDA (vaping). Really not what this is for, as only the two smallest sizes will do, sort of. Still too small. Would work better if it came with more sizes in between the smallest and the biggest, as the larger gauges are all but useless for coil wrapping. Next time I will buy a purpose made coil wrapping jig."

Home,5.0,"Awesome figure, codes are UK locked.","Timely shipping, even though I'm over in the US and it was shipping from France, she was here within a week and two days. My two complaints have to be that there's no instructions on how you get the sword or gun into her hands (and it honestly feels like you'll break both if you're not careful - YouTube was my best friend for this, to be quite honest) and the codes that came with her and Arno's Fearless Assassin figures are UK-locked.<br /><br />Overall, if you want two awesome figures, get Elise and the matching one of Arno. You won't be disappointed. If you want the codes and you live anywhere outside the UK, you're out of luck."

It looks as if it was used for about a month then returned then resold to me. I didnt return it because the the scratches dont effect the function in any way and since i carry it in my pocket any way i didnt think it was worth sending it back to get one that wasnt scratched so i could just scratch it. But it would have been nice to get it new because thats what i paid for. Other than the cosmetics not being perfect this thing is great. I use it for my meds and was worried Id have problems with the spring but it pulls right out. The inside is just a hair bigger than a quarter and about .75 of an inch deep not including the lid. Over all its well made and well worth the low price."

And of course you can use it for wire crafts as well if that's your thing, LOL."

However, it's not all that easy to line up the punch with its base plate and clean cuts are not guaranteed. Plus I punched three 6&#34; circles through standard card stock and halfway through the third circle the cuts that did come out well were no longer clean edged.  I have four cartridges and had near identical results with all three.  As an experienced paper crafter I did expect to have better results and was pretty disappointed that I wasn't able to consistently achieve the final look that was promised by the design of the tool."

Home,5.0,Love this sweeper.,"I have two small children that seem to leave crumbs on my floor at every meal. After they eat, one of them grabs the Swivel Sweeper and sweeps for me. It works great on smother surfaces like tile or hardwood and short carpeting. It doesn't do a good job on longer carpeting though. I bought my first Swivel Sweeper about 10 years ago. My ex got it in the divorce and I missed it so much I had to buy another one. It is so light and easy to operate that my 3 yr old can use it. In fact, it is so light you might mistake it for being poorly made but it's not! Just don't burn the motor out trying to use it on longer carpets. It is also great for older adults. I bought my 70 year old mom one and she loves it."

Home,5.0,Makes coils very nicely!,"Nice little kit!  Makes coils very nicely!  I wish it came with a case.  But, I'm not upset about that since it only cost $7.86.  The fact that it has a nice clamp for the work surface is worth more than that.  Others like this require the base be screwed down to the work surface.  Who wants that?  You will wind up cracking the wood of your work surface being that close to the edge.  Plus, you can move this out of the way when not in use."

Home,4.0,Nice scarf organizer but rings are small,"I'm a fan of boho designs (huge Free People fan!!) so I thought this scarf organizer would be perfect for my scarves! However, I had no idea that the little rings would be only 2&#34; diameter (just barely 2&#34; from the outer edges - the inside clearance of the ring is just around 1.5&#34;). These rings are thick and small, and there is no way to successfully hang all the pashminas and fluffy scarves I own. They might work well for small neck scarves though. I had to return this sadly..<br /><br />On a critical note.. the quality is just a little above average. The bodice is made of a shiny sturdy canvas type material, similar to backpack material. The rings are sturdy, but not completely smooth. I don't think a scarf would snag on them, but they aren't completely smooth. There are rings on both sides of this organizer, which is super convenient if you have a lot of scarves, but I imagine it would be hard to hang with other clothes in a closet as it would be so bulky and take up much space - I was going to hang it on my bedroom wall behind the door. The hanger hook is swivelly but the little melted nub on the bottom that keeps it in place on the cross bar seems a little weak. I wonder if I had filled the entire organizer with scarves if the hanger would have eventually broken? I had to return this as it was no use for my big scarves. FYI even though this qualifies as an Amazon Prime shipment, the returns are not free."

Home,4.0,Buy it and you will like it.,Love the little thing...it picks up off hard floors nicely and even picks up little stuff off the carpet avoiding a full blown vacuuming.  Never use a broom and pan again !<br />My only gripe?  I bought this one to replace the older model (loved it more) and the older model had a hinge on the bottom empty tray.... so once the latches are punched on top it dumped into the trash and you push it back with one hand.  The new one comes completely loose (no hinge) which means you have to use two hands to empty it so you don't lose the plastic tray in the trash.<br />Why replace the older one...I dropped something heavy on it in the garage.....it broke into pieces.  Dang !

Home,4.0,Nice looking product,"We have more recycling than garbage, so we reversed the sides on our can and added bold trash/recycling labels to the top.

Wish we could afford their correct size bags, but they cost too much more than standard larger size tall kitchen bags so we just tuck the excess in around edges."
Home,5.0,I love these labels,"I love these labels. I decorated out break room at work with the chalk paint décor. the labels look great and worked so well on cloth bins. They are used for coffee, tea, sugar, sub. sugar bins, everyone can find the storage of these items by the labels. Great for labeling the jars as well. Great service and arrived on time as said.

Home,2.0,Almost a good product but too cheaply made.,The blade starts to get dull REALLY fast and makes imperfect cuts or misses parts of the design altogether. Then it gets stuck where the peices haven't been completely cut out.

Home,5.0,Great trash can that is also very compact,"Great trash can that is also very compact. I love that I can put my trash and recycling in one container. It fit nicely under my counter overhang and freed up extra space in my kitchen. Very quiet to operate and very easy to change the liners.  I like that you can press the red button to keep the lid open during bag changes. I highly recommend this trash can, you won't be disappointed."
Home,5.0,Five Stars,This is a cool gadget. My coils came out perfect. Great tool for any jewelry maker!!
Home,5.0,This thing is cool,"While it is pretty easy to get any design into the Silhouette, if you already have something that you want to work on, there was previously no way to line up the cut lines with the material (exception for print & cut jobs, but again, that's starting with a design and not pre-existing designs).  Now I can use old greeting cards, my kids' drawings, or almost anything else to create designs.  An added bonus is that now you can use scraps of material left over from other projects.  Just arrange them on the mat, take a picture and line up your smaller cuts into the scraps."

Home,2.0,Not the best thing for wrapping vape coils,"Seemed like a good idea at the time for wrapping vape coils, but never really end up using it that much because of 2 reasons:<br />1 the included coil rods diameters' are not ideal size for fitting cotton through. I found that one was either too small, or the other was too big. I no longer use this to wrap my coils due to the lack in optimal diameter.<br />2 it is big so it is pretty much a &#34;home coil wrapper&#34;. Was a hassle to take it off and on a table all the time and couldn't really go anywhere else without having to lug it around.<br /><br />I would recommend just getting one of the micro coil building jigs for a bit more money.<br />This is a great tool, just not the best thing for wrapping vape coils (considering its intended for wire arts & crafts)"

Home,1.0,Precision not good!  Takes more time & work.  Disappointing.,"The idea sounds great but in reality this takes way more time and work than just printing registration marks on sheet to be cut.  First, tracing/threshold does not work well so it took extra time to place outlines for cut.  Second, the cut is not precise at all, there's unintended boarders in my cutouts.  I'm disappointed."

Home,5.0,Simply Stunning,"Oh, I had no idea it would be this good! This is so very simple, and has such incredibly lovely results. You absolutely cannot make a mistake.

I have made a 6&#34; and an 8&#34; circle with regular 20 pound paper, and a 12&#34; circle with tissue paper (the only thing I had that was big enough. I will need to get in some various colors of paper big enough for 9&#34; through 12&#34; circles.)  Anyway, the results are just awesome! I am just brimming with new ideas.

To secure the kanthal to the gizmo, I went to my local hardware store and purchased tiny bolts, washers and wing nuts (see pic). You'll be able to wrap any gauge of kanthal you desire. Even wrap twisted or parallel coils perfectly. Highly recommended to all you cloud chasers!"

Home,5.0,Good quality and worth the price,"The badge is sturdy and (just like in the description) constructed of metal. I had to wipe it down once I got it, but after that it looked very polished, it definitely gave the appearance that it cost more than ten dollars. My only complaint is that it came in a different packaging than advertised, which made it look almost like a toy."
Home,4.0,"I think this mat is an amazing idea, but in real life","I think this mat is an amazing idea, but in real life, it doesn't execute as well as the video shows. No matter how I try, the cutting is just slightly askew.  And weirdly enough, the amount it's askew varies across the page.  I think that in reality, that's due to me taking a picture that's not precisely parallel to the mat; I'm always at a slight angle in one direction or another even when I think I'm not, which slightly skews the cuts.  I would recommend just using the offset feature and adding a little bumper around your cut items, or even pulling the cut *in* slightly, to eliminate wonky edges that weren't supposed to be there.  Despite its imperfections, I still think this is a way better option than printing things with registration marks; that always seemed to be too huge of a pain to actually do.  So this is a step up from that.  :)"
Home,5.0,Five Stars,fine
Home,3.0,Works OK. Very hard to position for success.,"I have two of these, which came with the 880. They are very finicky. I use one to keep the Roomba away from the sliding glass door track. The Roomba actually pushes it out of position. There are many spots where it will cause the Roomba to get stuck and turn constantly leaving marks on the carpet that appear permanent. I've had the Roomba get past it somehow and not be able to get back. One inch change in position can be critical."

The great imagination of Eric Carle brings to life a Little Cloud, who trails behind the rest and morphs into all the animals he sees from the sky – a fluffy sheep, hopping rabbit and swimming shark. He longs to do un-cloudlike things and stay in one place, but alas, he has big jobs to do – like give us rain! Eric Carle’s intricately textured collages are beautiful to the eye and his short and sweet text is succinct and eloquent. Throw down a blanket on the next cloudy day, read this lovely book, and then see what shapes your little one can find in the clouds too!"

I also think they would be a great idea for homemade gifts or throw a pack of them into your next wedding present.  If you have trouble writing with the chalk included, merely sharpen the chalk."

Home,4.0,Very useful and stylish,"I was on the fence between this and two of the smaller ones, or one large can. I kind of wish I would have picked two smaller cans, it would have worked out to be more useful in my kitchen which can turn into absolute gridlock at the trashcan during high traffic hours."
Home,5.0,VG,works great.  good product.
Home,5.0,"Yes, I got this trash can for a Christmas present.","Yes, I asked for a trash can for Christmas. This is an amazing trash can.H<br /><br />Pros:<br />It doesn't smell --when you open it, you can smell 5 day old raw meat, but not when its closed.<br />Its easy to empty and clean. --I can easily carry both out to the trash outside. the bins are easy to remove and wash out.<br />Quiet--the lid doesn't make noise which is nice.<br />No kids/dogs--the lid closes so tightly, and high enough that our dog has yet to figure it out (and the no smell helps too) and no toddlers can get in it either.<br />Recycling--this is such a great way to have the recycling out of the way, and in a place where it doesn't smell and can be cleaned out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />price--obviously<br />trash bags--yes, they are expensive. here's the thing, I live where there's recycling and food compost. So we actually switched it so the recycling is on the large side and trash on the small side. even with that, we only go through 1-2 bags a week. I looked recently on amazon to get more bags and sellers wanted $40 for 50 bags, but I went into Bed Bath and Beyond and it was $16 for 60 bags. So SHOP AROUND.<br /><br />Overall, I love love love this trash can. It is worth the money. We have had it for 2 1/2 years and it is as good as new."

Home,5.0,Well worth it!,"This is a very smart addition to the Silhouette accessory lineup! Well made, works well with the program. I warn you, it may take a little fiddling around and some trial and error til you get it saved as a good profile in Silhouette Studio, but once you do, it cuts out most things very well! I think it depends a lot on the quality and angle of your picture, and I usually make sure to cut out everything with a bit of an offset, so that if it's a tiny bit off I don't lose anything crucial. But I've played around with this a bunch and PixScan is an amazing feature, making this mat a great investment! The price makes it an easy decision :)"
Home,5.0,Great deal on an awesome machine,"Love this machine! Way better than my ancient Cricut. I've heard the new Cricut Expression is equivalent, but I decided to go with the Silhouette Cameo instead. The technology has come a long way. I bought the designer software in addition to the machine so I can import my own SVGs and it works like a dream. Highly recommend it."

I have had three of these sweepers and always thought they were amazing.  The last one suddenly started scratching my wooden floors after less than a year.  I realized that the pads had worn down so I bought a new one.  The new one immediately scratched the floors.  The center rectangular portion of the undercarriage is just high enough past the pads to scratch the floors.  I had no idea it was happening and the scratches are really terrible.  It is (was) a beautiful solid cherry floor, now with scratches all over it.  I may be able to have them buffed out.  I'm not sure.  So like everything else, the manufacturer wanted to make a few pennies more and made cheap pads and ruined a good thing."

Home,5.0,Very pleased.,Make4s it possible to use scrap pieces instead of wasting them. Very pleased.
Home,3.0,"Has potential, but needs improvement","The PixScan mat has a lot of potential, and maybe it's due to user error, but I could not get consistently clean cuts with this.  The mat seems to work best if you have a solid and clean image.  You put the image on the mat, then take a picture of it, load the picture into the Silhouette Studio, and the program brings your image up.  You then have to add trace lines so that the Silhouette can cut the image.  This was probably the hardest part for me.<br /><br />I was using the Silhouette to cut out props that I made for a photobooth. For the images that were solid and not very intricate (e.g., mustache), the cutting was great.  Not perfect, but good enough and required only minimal cleanup.  But for the images that had any amount of detail (e.g., guitar with strings), the tracing could not get the little lines without creating a mess of the whole project. At one point, I thought it was because the photos were not very clear, so I tried retaking the pictures multiple times and uploading them in. As clear as the image was on the screen, I could not get the tracing right in high or low.<br /><br />I think I will try the scanner function next time, instead of taking a picture of the image.  The only problem is my scanner is meant for an 8.5x11, whereas this mat is 12x12.  Not sure how that will work, but I am guessing it would produce a much better quality image than taking the picture with your camera or phone (both of which I tried)."
Home,5.0,Perfect size for labels on a candy bar or a ...,Perfect size for labels on a candy bar or a trail mix bar (is what we used them for). They have great adhesion and easy to write on.
Home,4.0,A bit tricky at first but cool results,So after much grief and trial & error I finally got this to work.  :) It is really cool. I am using it mostly for cutting out things I have hand written in chunky letters on cardstock.<br />Make sure when you load your mat you have selected load cutting mat and NOT load media. I had this inadvertently checked and it was keeping the map from registering & cutting. No where in all of the research did I find Silhouette using this as a trouble shooting example. I only figured it out when I noticed that my regular paper cuts where cutting off of the mat.
Home,3.0,Pix Scan Mat,I could never get my camera/photo to sync up to the mat.

I love that the lid doesn't slam down and that I can click to hold the lid open while I'm cooking or changing the bag.  There is also a block in the bottom that lets you tilt the trash can for easier bag removal. I don't use the recycling bags; the bin is small enough that I just haul it out to our city-supplied can. I'm impressed at how well it controls odor.

Home,4.0,Great addition for open floor plans,Just the thing for open floor plans without doors.  While my vaccum shipped with two I really couldn't plan and control a week's vacuuming until I got two more units.  Now it's as easy as flipping a switch between Virtual Wall and Lighthouse mode on a couple of units to easily control where the next day's activities will occur.
Home,5.0,Five Stars,"Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you."
Home,2.0,Two Stars,wasted my money.
Home,4.0,Overall a nice product,"If you remove the spring then this thing holds 8 US quarters and 8 US dimes.  (The dimes fit up into the lid portion of the container.)  I don't believe it was designed to hold dimes in addition to the quarters but they do fit in there.<br /><br />It's pretty large and heavy on a key ring.  The diameter is expected; it's as wide as it has to be to accommodate the coins.  However, it is pretty tall.  If there are only quarters in it then over half of the height is wasted.  I do believe that it could be a little more inconspicuous with some design improvements.<br /><br />The gasket could be more functional, as well.  It just isn't very tight.  When the lid is screwed on completely the gasket squishes out of the sides."
