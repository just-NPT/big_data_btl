Our son loves to watch things move and loves animals.  Unfortunately the music was SO soft even on the loudest setting and the mobile itself was SOOOO slow that it would not keep his attention at all.  Looks like a great mobile but just didn't live up to its description.  Also, if you have a crib that does not have straight sides (e.g. there are some curves) the mobile attaches to it but it's very temperamental when it comes to the movement - you have to move the mobile to try to get it to work.

I really like the fact that Symphony in Motion is award winning but the biggest drawback to that one is the fact that it can actually keep babies awake because of how active it is.  And I like the Ocean Wonders mobile because of the ceiling projection but the drawback there is that people said you pretty much have to have the room pitch black dark to see those images well.  Since we keep a night light on for our little one, we decided against that one too.  In the end, we chose the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it seemed to be the most soothing and we were NOT disappointed.  She tries hard to stay awake and watch the leaves go and colorful animals go round and round.  But there's something about the slow speed of the rotation along with the jungle noise and/or classical music that just makes her drowsy everytime.

I wanted to set the record straight.  The mobile is quiet...but it's for a baby and you are trying to lull them to sleep so how loud do you want it to be?

My daughter loved, and still plays with, the matt itself. But as a GERD baby (throws up a lot) the spin toy didnt meet her approval. For one, it was a bit hard to lay on.

I would put her in it every day, and she would scream until she would vomit. More, the bug's antanee would get in her eyes. Once she got used to it, she still didnt find it very entertaining.     On the whole, I think its a good idea that needed more work. Its cute, the matt is still very useful, but the spinner in our house just sits in the corner, or holds toys.

When I have put her on the tummy time mats with the pillow she usually finds a way to push herself off of it and screams with her face in the pillow. This is a neat idea. She fits perfect on the seat that spins. She is 23 inches long. That mat though is very small, much smaller than I thought it would be. The toys are fun. My daughter really has no interest in the toys yet, but does love the mirror. When I put her on it for the first time she smiled and laughed and watched herself in the mirror for about 5 minutes before she started to cry. I figure that is pretty good for a first try. She has only had it for a few days and still only stays on for about 5 minutes. She has not learned to spin yet. She enjoys me laying her on her back to the spinner and spinning her around the room though. Overall this is a fun toy for her to play on with or w/o the spinner. I think she will enjoy this toy when she is able to sit on her own. I don't think though that this will help her learn to crawl like good old fashion tummy time.",2007-08-29

Sounds great on paper, but in practice this thing was like a torture device for my little one. It seems to me that there is a very small window of time when the saddle would be useful and safe for baby. It's that time after he has the considerable neck and back strength to maintain the position - arms extended straight down and locked, head lifted high and steady, and legs extended straight back - but before he is able to crawl. If your baby can do what the baby in the picture for this product can do, he will literally be crawling within a couple of weeks, if he isn't already, and he will spend most of his time trying to wriggle off of the thing. But what if your baby hasn't reached that point yet and still needs to put his head down every few seconds? It flops over the front of the saddle, straining baby's neck and back. When I figured that out, I immediately packed this back up and took it back to the store. The playmat can be used without the saddle, but I was unimpressed with that as well. The felt-like material attracted every little piece of dust and pet hair in our home like a magnet. I'm not sure what this accomplishes that a simple tummy-time pillow under baby's chest would not - and the pillow is a lot safer, less expensive and more comfortable for baby.",2007-11-02

At the time all the mobiles I saw for sale we pastel with \\""critters\\"" that faced up (baby sees bottom only) & were strictly wind up.    We use this mobile on our baby's bassinet.  The way it attaches may limit what it can be attached to.  My husband had a hard time getting it on securely.  Eventually he was successful.    We use this item throughout the day every day.  Our 9 week old loves it.  The mobile circulates as most do; however, this mobile has additional movement as the leaves go up and down.  This is eye catching for the infant.  Also- if you turn it off while the leaves are in the down position it makes it very compact.    The base which attaches to the crib is bulky.  It has a light, also eye catching, & sounds.  There are 4 different sounds.  One of which is a soothing jungle background (others are Midi type music).  Our infant enjoys this because it has an interesting monkey call.  If the room you are using this mobile in has any background noise the mobile seems too quiet even on the loudest setting.  In a quiet room the loudest setting seems loud (the lowest is fine).  You have the ability to turn the light on or off.  The same for the music.    The battery life seems to be good on this item.  It has an auto shut off feature that can be your friend or foe.  It saves you in batteries but can upset a child engaged in it's movements!  Luckily it has a remote you can use to quickly turn it back on (though it never seems to be near when I am busy)!

Now, from the picture, it looks as though the baby will be able to spin themselves, but for us that was not the case as my son was not able to push hard enough to spin himself.  So the spinning part will be left to the parents.  He also didn't interact too much with the toys attached to the mat, but that may just be him.  My son loved the section with the mirror and one with a worm on it, but the mat didn't seem to increase his ability/willingness to endure tummy time, but he did seem more content during it.    As soon as he was able to start spinning himself, he as just about to crawl and we preferred putting him flat on the ground and letting him get onto all fours to rock on his hands and knees or army crawl.

I recently found a slimmer design at BabiesRUS that is made by Huggies and has a flap in the center to access wipes. This Skip Hop case opens to one side and is hard to grab the wipes out.     I would like to edit my review to be only one star. After one week inside the case, my wipes were dried out. This is not acceptable.",2009-02-07

I have loosened the velcro attachment so that it is a larger loop. This allows you to close and open the stroller without the hassle of taking it on and off. Thank god! Cause it was a hassle to reattach it everytime. Now the attachment itself is so sturdy and allows drinks to ride securely with the wire frame and elastic.

No way to reach to the backseat and put it back in.    Unfortunately, the Wubbanub comes with a Soothie brand pacifier attached, and my baby simply does not take a Soothie.  So he makes a face and spits it out every time, and we're back to square one.  Now that he's 14 weeks and can grab things more easily, he seems to like to play with the Wubbanub, but in that case I could just have gotten a stuffed animal at the dollar store!

As a freshmen at Princeton, I was pretty nervous about starting college. However, I knew one of the ways I could bring my childhood and home with me was by decorating my room with a piece that evokes not only the playful and carefree nature of childhood, but also serves as a deep and penetrating metaphor for the ironic and misogynistic philosophies of many modern house cats. Ever since I was a youngin, I have been tortured by the heartless attitude that house cats have toward me. I felt that I would be lost if I didn't continue to harbor my hatred of these creatures while exploring my collegiate interests and broadening my world view. Hanging this mobile in my dorm room has helped me to become an active global citizen, in my opinion. I have garnered the respect of many of my professors as well as the other students on my floor. I highly suggest that an parent endeavoring to educate and enlighten their child, regardless of age, buy this mobile and hang it directly about their pillow. It is the will of the forest nymphs that all children become enlightened. That is why I have this mobile, and why my parents were willing to pay many dollars to give me a gift that I love.

We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the plush toy but I was willing to deal with it at the time.

However, when I saw this on clearance at Walmart, when my son was 5 months old, I decided to try it -- and now only regret I didn't get it sooner!  It is definitely a large mobile, but that became a non-issue, and the classical music is great.  The leaves and animals move slowly and calmly but have interesting colors and features, which keeps a baby's interest while not being over-stimulating.  There are four sound options (rainforest and three different classical composers), which if selected will run for about 15 minutes each before automatically shutting off.  No frequent resetting and no winding-up necessary -- a definite plus.  There are three options for light/music, light/music/motion, and music/motion, so it's not possible for the mobile to work with just motion and no sound, but you can have the nightlight off.    The music is slow-tempo, soothing and relatively quiet and has helped my son fall asleep countless times over the past six months.  We removed the mobile arm as soon as he could stand up, and switched the music/light/motion option at just music and light.  He absolutely loves pushing the big, colorful buttons to turn the music on and off by himself.    Practical notes: My initial set of D batteries is still going fine after six months, so they don't need frequent changing.  The mobile was easy to assemble and it was easy to detach the mobile arm when needed.  The only negative was that the on/off remote never seemed to work for \\""on\\"" for me -- only \\""off\\"" -- even when aligned as instructed.  Highly recommended.",2009-10-19

I had the old wind up type prior to receiving this one, and though it was cute, it always annoyed them both when it stopped, along with the loud clanking of winding it back up,  the disturbance of CLANK, CLANK, CLANK was both annoying and inconvenient.

The two drink holders are stretchy enough to hold cans, water bottles, and the types of paper cups provided by quick service restaurants.  The loops used to connect it to the stroller fit very well on the extended posts of the adjustable handles. The bump created where the handle branches provides an excellent stop for the bag and so it stays very steady and even.  Drinks do not tip and we have had no problems with stability when we take three mile hikes over slanted and rocky sidewalks.    The center section has been a wonderful repository for my pepper spray, cell phone, and MP3 player.  The zippered portion is very slim, and best suited to very thin items. The Buggy Buddy slightly impedes use of the top storage bag on the back of the Techno XLR's hood, but does not fully block access to the small covered pouch.  I feel the small frustration is a small price to pay for two cup holders and additional easy access storage.    When we collapse the stroller I undo one of the connecting straps but leave the other connected to the stroller, this allows the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy to stay with the stroller but without stressing the wire structure.  While I can close the stroller with the Buggy Buddy fully connnected, I have read that others have bent or broken the super-structure of the Buggy Buddy and so this seems a nice compromise.  I keep everything in one place, it takes only a moment to put on and off, and I am am decreasing the risk of damaging the Buggy Buddy.    Update April 2011: Wire superstructure broke. Forgot to lift loop off of the handle before folding stroller. Still somewhat functional, but sharp ends necessitate removal from stroller. I wish they would re-design product with a less fragile structural element.    The quality of the product is higher than I expected and it seems sturdier than other higher priced stroller accessories I have purchased.  We are about to take it on two crosscountry flights and a fourteen night stay at Disney World.  So,in the next month it will tackle toddlers, teenagers, heat, rain, flight crews, trains, buses, and boats.  If anything breaks or has problems I will update this account.

There are MORE pros than cons for this wipes case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. you can attach it to stroller or outside of diaper bag.<br />2. it's made of much harder plastic than the cheap travel wipes cases that come free in the box when you buy diapers in bulk.<br />3. you can really open it with one hand, allowing your other hand to be holding baby.<br />4. easier to remove wipes than it is from those cheap travel cases (mentioned above in #2)<br />4. holds WAY more wipes than those cheap travel cases do<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The case snaps shut but tends to open on its own too easily. Example: I was walking and only holding the case by the black strap so it was swinging with my arm motion. The case popped WIDE open and all my wipes fell into the dirt (we were camping)! LAME-OLA.

But given that my husband and I are complete coffee addicts, the main reason I bought the Buggy Buddy was the cupholders. I hoped against hope that the cupholders would accommodate cups of iced and hot coffee and hold them securely enough to prevent spilling, but I fully expected to be disappointed. Much to my surprise, the Buggy Buddy worked exactly the way I hoped it would. It attaches very securely to the stroller, and even with two heavy drinks in it, the Buggy Buddy doesn't tip. The storage area between the cupholders is the ideal size for all those small items you don't want in your pockets. We're able to collapse the stroller without detaching the Buggy Buddy, and so far, the BB hasn't sustained any damage. This is an extremely well-made item for the price.

So we searched for a longer-lasting, remote-controlled one. This mobile is cute, albeit it doesn't match his room decor, and it is bright and engaging. Our 4 1/2 mo old loves to watch the leaves (they go up and down around the animals as they rotate). It was easy to install and I like the fact that it uses D batteries, so hopefully they last quite awhile. We don't usually turn the actual unit off, so it can be operated by the remote control any time. Overall we really like it for its length of operation, its design and its ability to entertain baby. I have a few minor caveats: The remote doesn't work from too far away; the sensor on the main body has to be visible to the sensor on the remote (no operating from behind the door or around the corner). The second is the music. Though it is calming and classical and largely not annoying, it is midi music, and I wish it were real symphonic music. At this point, baby doesn't seem to mind but it does bother me a bit. Lastly, I wish the music would fade instead of turning off at the timer.

Maybe he's just sensitive though...Overall it was a great purchase for the price and we use it very often.",2010-11-02

I tried several items, and this was by far the best fit.  It doesn't have a huge amount of space, but it is enough for a 3/4 liter camelbak bottle (fits well and can be removed and replaced with one hand with a little practice!), a sippy cup or bottle for my son, a cell phone, keys and a small wallet.  It is also sturdy enough that I wouldn't worry about a cup of tea in a travel cup spilling - that was my biggest concern.  I assumed that it would swing back and forth throughout our walks (I walk at least 3 miles with my son every day), but it is really very sturdy when it is weighted down with our gear.  There's even a small compartment for stashing a bit of cash/change as needed.  For $10, it is exactly what we needed.    For those who want something flashier, the Baby Jogger Parent Console with build in mp3 player also worked well on the Uppa Baby and was an easier fit for the camelbak (no learning curve on how to get it in and out with one hand), but for $50, the unnecessary additional of the mp3 speakers wasn't worth it to me (and it seemed somewhat obnoxious to boot!).",2010-11-19

When I was looking at a parent compartment to add, I really didn't want to spend a whole lot of money, and didn't like the cost/design of the parent console sold by Baby Jogger so I bought this one. My one and only hesitation in buying this was that it attaches by velcro and we all know that velcro can fail over time. I have not had this problem with this at all. I put this on my Baby Jogger City Mini when it came in, and have removed it several times to use on a Graco Mosaic stroller. The velcro is awesome and I've never worried about it coming off either stroller. I just wrapped it tightly around, and it's snug as can be.

The music is perfect for soothing very soft & slow and the motion is engaging enough to grab their attention but subtle enough to lull them to sleep.  Also the battery life is decent, in use every night & 2 naps a set of batteries would last 4-6 months.  Even after being in use that long it was still in great condition so we took it out for our son (2 months old) but he does not appear to be a fan.  Possibly he'll like it as he gets older but for now even the soft music & motion is too stimulating for him and gets him worked up rather then soothed.  A simple heartbeat generator w/ no motion or light soothes him best, so I would say no matter how great the product is know your child & what works for them.

The dual motion of the spinning animals and opening/closing leaves is very stimulating for baby. At 5 months, he still loves it. Of course, it has never soothed him to sleep - perhaps because it is so stimulating.    Also good to note - this is a very heavy (and top heavy) mobile. I find it places some pressure on the side of my (Davinci Emily) crib. This is not a good mobile for a portable crib, like a pack-and-play.    Smelled a little chemical-ly when I opened it... but that smell went away.    At first, one of the leaves was too stiff and stayed in place while the others moved... I would manually move it in time with teh others and after a few days it loosened up... I assume that flaw was just a fluke... most people dont seem to have that problem, but if you do - thats how I fixed it.    It is easy to take on and off the crib - as it has a screw back - but I think it kind of scratches the crib when I take it on and off... and the MDB crib does scratch sometimes.    Colors are very bright, cheerful and visible to baby. Animals are plush and very cute.    The product instructions say not to use past 5 months... we have - but will take off after baby pushes up on hands and feet.    Good to know that this converts to a crib music/light box after the baby is too old for the mobile. Music is soft and not annoying. There are three settings - night light (where the lower body of the mobile lights up) lights + mobile, or just mobile.    Quite a large, bulky mobile but baby loves it. Music lasts 18 minutes - just enough time for mommy to take care of one thing around the house! My active child cannot be fascinated by it much longer than that... For longer playtimes, we go with the Baby Einstein play mat.",2011-01-18

It does a pretty good job of keeping the pacifier in my 4wk old sons mouth. When I first gave it to him he grabbed onto the plush little monkey and held it tight. It stays in his mouth as long as he doesn't move around too much. I think that has to do with the fact that my son tends to suck and stop and suck again. If you have a strong sucker I don't think this would happen.     I gave this a 4 star rather than a 5 because not long after we got it (about a week) part of the stitching on the pacifier came undone. It still works, and the pacifier is still very secure, I just can see it possibly falling off in a few months or so...especially because it is all he wants to use. I do think it could have to do with the way we have used it (I place it in his mouth when I am cradling him close to my chest to calm him down, which causes the pacifier to kinda pull to the side...the same side that the stitching came undone on). All the same it is a great product and I plan on buying more in the future.    FYI- I purchased this product on Amazon from one of their private sellers. I got free shipping however spent 19.99 for this Monkey one because it said it was the last one and other sites had it on back order. I wanted the monkey so I spent the extra money (Most others are only $12-14), only to log back on a few days later and see amazon selling it for cheaper with free super saver shipping and the same seller still saying they only had one left. In fact I think it still says that lol. Just be careful when not buying direct from amazon.    All in all I am not upset for spending a a few bucks more than normal...even at that price it has been totally worth it and a life saver for any mom with a fussy baby!",2011-01-26

The Fisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile fit the bill and included some features we really find noteworthy.<br /><br />As this mobile rotates, the leaves flap up and down like wings on a bird.

While my wife and I prefer the Baby Einstein product lines take on some of the classical composers, our baby seems to be soothed to sleep by the Fisher Price interpretations just fine.

It's not too loud and won't keep a baby ((or you)) awake. The light it gives off isn't too bright. The mobile not only rotates 3 small, plush animals but raises and lowers 3 leaves. In a dark room a child won't be able to see the motion even with the night light feature on. It only plays for 18 minutes. Which is good and bad. Good: plays just long enough for a tired child to fall asleep before turning off. Bad: doesn't play long enough and upsets the child if it turns off. The remote is nice but only works if it's been on very recently. You can't start the mobile with the remote. Battery life seems good.    This is not designed for a soft-sided crib or playpen (which is what we originally had as our child's bed for the first few months). It's also not designed to fit on a very thick/wide crib rail. I was considerate of this fact when I finally bought a full size crib recently. I still had a little trouble mounting the mobile as the 'screw' part was far too long and I had to cut a couple of inches off so the crib could sit closer to the wall.  ***UPDATE 7/24/2011***  After having this mobile for nearly a year it stopped spinning properly. The music and lights working perfectly. So I thought the batteries were weakening. Even with new batteries the mobile needed help to start spinning sometimes. I don't know if it stopped spinning once it started as I would leave the room so my child could sleep. I contacted Fisher Price regarding the issue and they have asked me to ship just the base to them for a replacement. Seems to be a known issue.  ***UPDATE 12/13/2011***  I've had the replacement for about 4mons now and it seems to be fine. After reporting the issue, and shipping just the base back, it took about 6wks to receive the replacement which is a brand new mobile. I had expected just a new or refurbished base...seems kind of a waste. Oh, well. The 6wk wait sucked as my daughter still relies on this to sleep.

I'm currently pregnant with our third child and we're purchasing the City Mini Double Stroller.  We love the stroller but the accessories have to be purchased separately and they are not cheap.  I definitely wanted a child's tray for my two older children (6 & 2 1/2) to use while in the stroller but I didn't want to spend a fortune.      I decided to try out the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy because of the good reviews and the awesome price.  When the Buggy Buddy arrived I tested in out on our Sit n' Stand stroller and was very impressed!     PROS:      1. It can be collapsed and thrown in the stroller basket without taking up valuable space and is flexible so it doesn't affect folding the stroller, whether attached or stowed in the basket.    2. It has a pretty sturdy wire frame all around the top so that it holds it's shape and supports the items inside.    3. It is large enough to fit two Sippy Cups or bottles, and snacks or toys.  It even has a small zipper section that could be used to store pacifiers or other small items.    4. The Velcro straps are strong enough to secure the Buggy Buddy around the bumper bar of the stroller.  It stays in position without sliding along the bar or falling off while moving, if secured very tightly.    5. The fabric is super easy to clean if there are any spills.      6. Can be attached on either side of the bumper bar of the stroller.  This way it can be placed in the position most convenient and most comfortable for your child.  On the Sit n' Stand it works best attached to the outside of the bumper bar with our older children.    7. It can also be used as a parent console, its original purpose.  I love products that can be used in multiple ways!    8. Because of the wire and flexible fabric it should work with a variety of stroller types.  So, when my older children do not want to ride in a stroller and I go back to using a single, I can still use this product.      9. The pockets are deep so that the items are less likely to fall out when going over rough terrain.    CONS:    1. A younger child may enjoy kicking the Buggy Buddy and some of the items may fall out.  But, the tray can always be taken off and stored underneath the stroller when this becomes a problem.      2. It does not hold open drink containers without spilling them.  This is not a huge problem for us since we primarily use closed drink containers for our children (Sippy Cups, baby bottles, water bottles, etc.).  For the parents we have purchased the Munchkin Stroller Cup Holders to attach to the stroller handle and they work okay on smooth surfaces.  We plan on upgrading in time to the Baby Jogger Liquid Holsters (for the parents) which according to reviews do not spill liquids as much when going over bumps and rougher terrain.    3. It does not have a hard surface to double as a high-chair-tray-on-the-go.  This can be easily remedied in two ways.  One, bring a hard lidded container to fit inside the Buggy Buddy for messier food items. *Benefit: leftovers can be stored away for later. Two, use a disposable stick-on placemat to create a feeding pocket in the middle of the Buggy Buddy.  *Benefit: easy clean-up, just pull off and out with all the food leftovers safe inside and throw away. Also, these can be purchased in a super handy pop-up travel case.    OVERALL:    For the price, I think this is a fantastic product.  I am excited to try it out with the City Mini Double Stroller and hope to update my review overtime.  Thank you to Sunshine Kids for providing a quality product for a reasonable price!",2011-02-15

I bought it second hand, and it has been holding up, which speaks well of its durability.  It works well for putting the little one to sleep with the lights out, but it also entertains him for quite some time when he is awake.  He loves the music (at first he spent most of the time staring towards the speaker, smiling and cooing), and a plus is that the music, though electronic, manages not to be irritating to us the parents (we have to hear it through baby monitor when we are out of the room).  The three options for classical music (which on my model are confused, by the way:  you press Beethoven, you get Mozart, etc.) each play two pieces, so there is a good deal of variety, and of course there is the jungle sounds option which is best for sleep.  The moving figures are colourful and stare down at the child, and they not only go around in circles, but when they brush up against the leaves they spin around on their own strings a bit, which keeps baby fascinated.  I was worried at first that they were moving too slowly, but the speed seems to be just perfect for the baby.

We have two so that one is available while the other is in the washing machine. She actually demands both of them when she goes to bed or takes a nap though.     She'll be weened off the pacifier soon. We might buy a third and clip the pacifier off of it so she can still keep the monkey as a toy/companion. We could do that with one that we own now, but I wouldn't want to do that to one of them.    We bought two of the giraffe Wubbanubs for our new daughter who is now 10 weeks.

The feet dangle from the plush body, the belly of which also has a black and white pattern. The head and body are plush, but the neck is floppy. A wide velcro-closed loop is attached to the head for attaching to other things.  Review:  I have a 6 month old son, and I'm beginning to notice the short timespan many toys are developmentally appropriate for babies. They just grow and learn so fast! This toy is an exception to that rule. We got this as a Christmas present when he was 2 months old, and at first, he mostly just liked to watch it as we dangled it above him. It caught his interest very well, though -- we would just hold it and twist it gently, and because the neck is floppy, the toys would just dangle and swing around -- worked like a charm at stopping a few fussy fits.   We then hung it from the bars of his activity mat, and he really loved batting at it -- the big black and white foot was the best (my husband called it the \\""hypno-foot\\"" because of the black and white swirl and circle design -- and it hypnotized the baby.) Once he was old enough, he really liked grabbing onto the ring \\""foot\\"". Now he is teething, and the red flat plastic foot and the mirror foot are great things to chew on. He has outgrown the activity mat somewhat, but likes playing with the giraffe while sitting or during tummy time. I have a feeling he hasn't found the end to it's uses yet!  Very few toys can hold the interest of a 2,3,4,5, and 6 month old (and likely beyond). The fact that this has a nice large velcro loop for attaching to things also means that you can attach it wherever without having to worry about using the plastic ring things -- it can wrap around a carrier handle or a crib rail just as well (which are hard to attach things to with the rings).  Love this way more than the Lamaze giraffe we also have (he has never been too interested in that one) -- so if you're going for a giraffe toy, get this one instead!  UPDATE -- my son is now 11 months old, and loves having the giraffe attached to the bar across his car seat. It worked as a great distraction on some long trips. I think he'll be disappointed when we move him to the next size up car seat and we have no where to hang it!",2011-04-28

This fits the stroller great. A few reviewers have mentioned needing to take the holder off when you collapse the stroller so you don't bend it - but this is not an issue with the BOB. The pouch has a metal ring around the top surface that holds it open, but the sides are just fabric. With a stroller with 2 individual handles that collapse inward you would need to remove it so as to not bend the metal, but if you have a bar handled stroller you can collapse it and it collapses vertically just fine.    The two cupholders on the sides are neoprene dividers, they seem to accommodate a large range of cup sizes so far. The large center section has a zippered pocket it the back that is pretty small but would hold a set of keys or a phone. I'm not sure why you'd need to zip something in unless it was going to be something you'd leave with the stroller between uses, but there you go. The center compartment can hold a lot - phone, snacks, toys, etc. You can also put the neoprene of the cupholders to the sides if you want more center room or only have one cup. It attaches to the stroller handles via two velcro loops on the sides - the velcro is the whole length of the loop so it would fit a very wide range of handle types/sizes.

We tried several of the wind up mobiles but they make loud clicking noises when you wind them and they last 2 minutes tops! We were looking for a mobile with a remote that we could use to start/stop the mobile from the door so we didn't wake him back up when he was drifting off or we could use it from our bedroom when he stirred in the middle of the night to occupy him and send him back off to sleep.  This mobile seemed like just the thing! Unfortunately, the remote control is not very useful for those purposes. It only starts the mobile up if you click the single button on it within a few minutes of the mobile turning off.  However, since the mobile itself is battery-powered and the music/sounds last 12 minutes, the remote is hardly ever needed. He's nearly always off to sleep prior to the music/sounds ending. A few of the reviews state the volume isn't loud enough. I don't find this to be true at all.  There are two settings and the loud is plenty loud for a baby drifting off to sleep. Since we've gotten this, I find he'll even wake up and play contentedly in his crib for a bit before letting me know he's ready to get out. He'd wake up and scream immediately prior to this. Our son is nearly 7 months old now and the colors, sounds, moving leaves and animals still captivate him. I highly recommend this mobile. Definitely worth the money.",2011-06-10

This is in the top 3. My son was born with a cleft lip/palate.. but he LOVES to suck. Unfortunately, with the cleft he isn't able to latch on normally, so the \\""spitting out the paci\\"" is constant with him. I decided to try one of these as a last resort after many many sleepless nights. It took him a day or two to catch on, but now he loves it more than anything. It is his \\""lovie\\"" and he squeezes it while he falls asleep, and holds onto it or rests his head on it after he falls asleep. It is truly a great idea & I recommended it to a friend who also loves it.     The only \\""CONS\\"" would be ..They make it sound like a beanie baby style toy, or \\""bean filled\\"" .. so I expected something heavier. It is very literally just a small plush toy, there really isn't any extra weight to it. So it can still be spit out (thats the point of course) but I think they could add a little bit more weight to help it stay where it's wanted without jeapordizing safety. Also, its been said a million times.. thankfully my little guy only takes Soothies, but for the babies that like a different shape of Paci, what gives? + The cleaning issue, which isn't really an issue, toss it in the wash, then air dry. Just wash the nipple in dish soap and rinse thoroughly.    I didn't realize how much I loved it until I couldn't find it yesterday.. I was in a panic! It is a good investment, although pricey for what it is. I just ordered my second one. (A frog this time!) .. so it has obviously won me over in all it's simplicity. ;)",2011-06-10

It looks like a good product other than mine arrived broken.  The velcro is detached from the strap.  Upon closer inspection, the sticking on the other straps are also poorly done.  To exchange it will take 3-6 weeks which would mean not having a drink holder for the best of the summer. If I return it the shipping cost is half the price of the item. I guess I'm going to attempt to repair it on my own.  If that doesn't work, I'll invest in the Baby Jogger Parent Console. If you get one that's sewn correctly, I'm sure it's great.

Cup holders can difficult to get beverages into. It's nice that they are stretchy so they \\""hold\\"" multiple sized beverages BUT they are hard to get cups back into with one hand (In other words, I can't grab a sip of water while walking.)

The bars on this stroller are pretty thick and all the cup holders that are made for umbrella strollers don't fit (the bars are a lot thinner on umbrella strollers). This caddy has a velcro strap on each side that you can adjust to fit securely between the open space of the handles. There is a snug cup holder on each outside edge of the item, with a space in between for sunglasses, maps, sunscreen, or snacks, etc, plus a zippered pocket on the inside for keys, membership cards, or whatever. One reviewer mentioned that it swung a bit (but you can tighten those velcro straps so that it barely moves at all) so you need covered drinks, and maybe that's true... but we always use those anyway, and the drink holder pocket is flexible enough to hold a good size, tall cup and keeps it steady. I am a very happy buyer and highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't have cup holders on their stroller and even those who do, but want a little more storage space. Also... it stays on very nicely when you fold the stroller, no need to remove. Love it!",2011-07-08

It took a bit to put together, but it wasn't too hard at all, I'd rather be safe than sorry. The colors are very vibrant and the nature sounds are very beautiful and realistic  along with the choice of music.  As soon as it was complete I showed my son and if a 10 week old could dance, he did.  His feet have not stopped kicking since.  He just loves this mobile and is absolutely mesmerized by it.  He talks to the animals and smiles when he is in a playful mood but when it's time for nap or bed time this soothes him immediately and he falls asleep in mins.  We've never needed the remote.  This was the best purchase we've made. I would definitely recommend buying this over the other mobiles. UPDATE:  he is now 12 weeks old and the mobile stopped working.  We've replaced the batteries and that still didn't fix the problem.  We were told by a fisher price representative that to fix the problem we should remove the leaves.

I KNOW that you need to remove plastic films from toys...duh!  The actual MIRROR can come loose and come off in the child's mouth and choke them.<br /><br />I have removed the mirror insert now and given the toy back to my son, but POO POO on KIDS II for having no clue on this issue and not even attempting to correct it.<br /><br />Parents, just be aware and remove the mirror.

She also loves music and is attracted to lights as well. We have a stationary mobile that spins when you wind it up that matches her crib set, but she liked the movement so much I got tired of winding it up every 3 minutes. (She cries when it stops!) I researched alot of reviews on mobiles, and decided to give this one a shot giving that most of the reviews were good, and the other rainforest collection has a pretty good track record of good reviews.<br /><br />Man am I disappointed. I got the mobile yesterday, gave it fresh batteries, put it on the crib, got the baby, turned it on....the baby barely noticed it was there!!! The music is super quiet. It's honestly so quiet that if the baby cries or someone is talking in the same room, you can't hear it at all. The light is VERY dim, not bright enough to catch my little one's attention. Lastly, but not at all least, the mobile moves slower than an ox! It's honestly ridiculous. The wind up mobile moves quicker when wound! I read the bad reviews and I thought I could live with quiet music and dim lights, but as long as the mobile worked well my little one would be fascinated. But no, it moves so slow that she gets bored within 5 seconds. The biggest problem like another one star rater mentioned is that the leaves slow it down trying to constantly rise and fall, and they catch on the animals everytime the animals pass which slows it down because it gets stuck for a few seconds. Terribly designed product in every way.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, this product isn't even worth the price to ship it to your home. This sounds harsh, but I am a real mom telling you the honest truth.<br /><br />I will say that I had the The First Years - Nature Sensations Dreams In Sight Mobile when my daughter was a baby, almost 4 years ago, and it is still being sold currently, and this mobile did work great for us.us.",2011-08-19

I think they could have been made better.  They don't stretch so it's difficult to put these on. They aren't like other booties, socks, etc. that are made with the contours of feet in mind but rather a long \\""tube-like\\"" cover for your baby's foot. Plus, I think they are a little too short in length.  Without any stretch to them, they tend to ride down my baby's foot and eventually come off.

I looked at their branded option for nearly $30 and only so-so reviews. Being frugal, I was on the hunt for something less expensive that would get the job done. The Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory is great. It is a heavy duty fabric that can basically stand up on end although it can be flattened as it arrived that way in the packaging. The cup holders will hold a pop can or a water bottle just fine. And I love the space in the middle for anything extra you would need to bring. There is a zipped mesh little pocket in the inside as well that I didn't know it had before purchasing. It would be perfect to put a house key in or a few dollars, etc. I was worried how it might hang from the City Mini and if I could easily get things in and out of it. The velcro straps are very long and you can adjust how high or low you would want it to sit as well as where on the handle bars you would want it to be. The ONLY drawback is the logo printed on the outside. It is rather obnoxious. The design isn't very professional or modern and it's big with colors that aren't very 'today'. I am a graphic designer so I think that is the only reason it bugs me. I will either hang it backwards on the stroller or even put black tape over it. It is just one of my hang ups, I guess. This is going to get the job done and I'm happy about it's affordable price tag. I highly recommend the purchase of this accessory.",2011-08-25

Initially I thought I could live without it, but once I got moving I decided that I really needed one.  I looked at different models online and scoped out the other strollers in the neighborhood-at the park, the bus stop, farmers markets, and saw that many of them were using the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy.  I wanted something to hold drinks, keys, and other essentials so that I did not have to take my purse along on every single walk.      It was definitely the best price compared to other brands/models. I am able to carry all of my stuff around without spilling or losing anything.  The cup holder sections hold everything from a take out coffee cup (hot or cold 16-20oz), water bottle (I usually have a camelback 24oz bottle), or a baby bottle without spilling or falling out.  I also like the inside zippered pocket I can stash my keys, phone, and a few $$ in there while we are out walking.

I would recommend this to anyone who does not have a cup holdr on their stroller. Also it did not get in the way of my baby bag which we hang from the stroller handles as well.,2011-09-06

I originally recieved this as a gift when pregnant with my son...he is now 14 months old and has a little sis on the way and STILL loves watching and playing with this mobile!     There are two volume settings for the tunes which are perfectly set. Of the two volume settings one is set to be fairly quiet for nighttime and napping and then there is the higher setting for playtime. The animals are very vibrant in color and the moving leaves are adorable. There is also a night light setting as well. You also have the option of 3 sets of tunes or rainforest nature noises. This is truly a wonderful item that I recommend for everyone whether it matches the theme of the room or not. My son absolutely loved watching all of the moving animals and leaves...I would joke that he thought going to bed was playtime because he would get so excited to see his mobile. Excellent item!,2011-09-09

He first started to really notice it at about 3 weeks or so, and it's still a hit at 8 weeks.  We'll lay him in his crib to change his clothes, and he'll just stare at it in fascination.  He'll be so involved that we often just leave him there, where he kicks his legs and moves his arms and \\""speaks\\"" to it.  It occupies him on average for about 20 minutes.  From my own perspective, I just love the colors and the animals.  They're so happy and lively.  The underside of the green, flapping leaves is an iridescent green (which adults may not notice, unless they bend over to see it from the angle of the baby.) These fabric leaves almost haphazardly flap (by design) but always manage to not mess anything up.  They often tap the animals, and help the movement seem a little more lively.  Regarding the music, I suspect it's great for the baby, but I find the songs to be a little slow and monotone for my taste. (Slower and less lively than the actual versions of the Bach/Beethoven/Mozart songs.) Thankfully, there is also a nature sounds option, which I usually choose.<br /><br />EDIT<br />My baby is now 23-months and he still loves this mobile, but now HE gets to be in charge of it since he can push the buttons.  It's basically part of his crib toys now.  Some reviewers complained that this eats batteries, but I've seen the exact opposite.  In 23 months (of almost daily use), I've had to change the batteries twice.  Also, when the batteries run down, the mobile moves really slowly, so there's nothing physically wrong with the mobile.  New batteries fix that problem immediately.",2011-09-15

It didn't break, it's comfy, and it's easy to set up.  I bought this item based on price, having compared other small and inexpensive gyms with it.  I saw that the info said that the hanging toys are attached by velcro, and it didn't occur to me that meant I couldn't add toys to it without some fanagling (making my own loops to add).  I'm disappointed with the tiger--he looks really cute, but he's very hard plastic, and it wasn't easy for my son to get the music to play for the first 2 months of use (at 3 mo.+). The only way to get the music to play, is if the ball it's holding gets \\""rolled\\"" between its paws.  This is the only noise-making item on the gym, except for the roller ball at the foot pad.  Now that he can consistently make the tiger play music (5 mo.), he's really getting too big for the whole gym.  I also wish that I would have chosen one that has travel closures, but I knew ahead of time that this one did not.  So my opinion of flaws are: no loops to attach your own toys, not enough/easy enough interactive items, and no travel closures.  One thing that I added to make it more fun is the Infantino chime animals:  [[ASIN:B00494CKIS Infantino Tag Along Chimes, Frog and Duck]]  The loop on those fit perfectly around the bar.",2011-09-22

At first my daughter wasn't a fan but now she loves it.  And my son likes one type of music and my daughter the other.  Every kid is different so try the different options for music.  And it has lights!  Love it.  I am so glad I made this purchase.  I was well worth it and way less than the silly hand crank ones.  Definitely recommend it!,2011-10-17

The first is staying in my diaper bag, the second will be for my changing table to hold wipes when I buy them in big bulk bags. I saw some reviews that said the big red button didn't slide. I was disappointed by that at first too, until I realized it's actually a very smart design where if you push down on one side of the button while sliding it, it unlocks it. The button is supposed to be locked in place when it's closed to prevent it from accidentally sliding open and drying out the wipes. It is a bit bulky, but it also holds a lot of wipes. I haven't had any problems with it popping open or the snap coming undone. I love this thing!",2011-10-19

I like that it's not too bulky so that my 4-1/2 year old daughter can still sit or stand on the back of the stroller and get in and out without upsetting the contents of the holder.  I put my tall Contigo water bottle in it and it was very stable and doesn't tip over even though it looked off balance.  My water bottle goes in one pocket and my daughter's goes in the other with room for wallet, camera, phone, and keys in the center.  I definitely like the two water bottle separators and I also like the mesh and zip pockets for the phone and keys.  Overall, it's great so far.  In writing the review today I noticed the pricing says $16.99.  I don't think it's worth that much and not sure why the sellers have it priced there.  Maybe I got lucky.  Hope the price comes down.

The software is terrible. This is sold as a device for Apple iOS things- iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, but the computer software that comes with it is only for Windows. The iOS software has very few features. For starters, you can ONLY access this device if you are on a WiFi network- they make no accommodation for a lower-quality feed via 3G or other cellular data network standards. So, the box is misleading when it says you can access from anywhere. You can set alerts for motion or sound, however you must have the app running on your iOS device actively to receive the alert, so there goes your battery on the phone! I would have expected the alert to trigger an email or text. If you happen to have a windows machine or have windows on your mac, again, it must be on and running, and then their software is able to record, but the iOS app has no way of accessing that information from anywhere.

US,10089993,R21X7ZRZ5BDP4H,B0028IDXDS,450475749,WubbaNub Brown Monkey Pacifier,Baby,2.0,0.0,0.0,N,N,Sometimes works,"First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the monkey is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.    Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the monkey.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.  Third, the monkey is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the monkey doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the monkey into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place.",2011-12-01

He absolutely loved it, from start to finish. The mobile was calming for him, as was the music. After he was old enough to stand and get into trouble grabbing the mobile, we removed it but kept the musical base. That base was his lullaby every night for pretty much the whole time.<br /><br />The mobile slowly rotates when music is playing. The base is bulky, but attaches safely onto the rail of your crib with a (non-marring) screw-in pressure clamp. The mobile plays several different songs, but my son always wanted the same one.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ my son loved it! as a mobile when he was very young, and as a lullaby music box when he got older<br />+ buttons are accessible from the crib. The unit was mounted high enough he didn't hit the buttons on accident, but could turn it on to self-sooth in the middle of the night, if he wanted.<br />+ mobile is cute, and removeable, which extended its usable life for us.<br /><br />Con:<br />- the mounting hardware is a bit bulky. We had to keep the crib an extra inch or two away from the wall because of how long the large pressure screw was<br />- the whole thing is a bit big and bulky. This in general doesn't matter, but when we wanted to bring it with us on trips or on the airplane it took up lots of room. Probably not a consideration for most people :)<br /><br />Overall we were very happy with this mobile. We even took the base on trips with us to help our son feel comfortable wherever we happened to be traveling to, especially at night.",2011-12-03

I've had it for about a year now (my daughter is now 15 months old) and it works great.  I bought it in part because there were reviews that it was too quiet (and also because I had other rainforest products my baby liked).  As far as I'm concerned, if it's on the crib and it's playing music for my baby to go to sleep to, I want quiet and soothing.  I leave it on the lower of the two sound levels and I can hear it just fine (even with a humidifier and fan running for white noise in the same room) so I'm pretty sure the baby in the crib can hear it.  The movement of the rainforest animals is very quiet too which is nice. I like the classical music selections as well as the rain forest sounds.  And the light is a low/warm light that isn't disturbing at all to a sleeping (or almost sleeping) baby.  My daughter goes to sleep to it every night and if she wakes up in the night she just hits the button to start it up again and goes back to sleep.  We even travel with it and attach it to the crib at Grandma's house to help my daughter sleep away from home.    The only negative thing I have to say about it is the remote control is pretty much useless.  It appears to only work if you've recently turned the mobile on manually (but you have to use it within about 15 min of turning the mobile on).  I'm not sure what the point of that is.    But overall this has been one of my best purchases and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quiet/soothing mobile.",2011-12-08

The best feature to this playmat is the tummy-time display at the end with a mirror, rolly-ball, and silky leaf-flap. This continues to be a favorite place for tummy-time.  The little pillow that comes with is pretty useless, but a good idea. We also switch up the structure of this so that the arch is over the actual mat.   This is also a great set-up for play in a bebepod/bumbo chair, as the hanging toys are within reach of a baby in such a seat.   I wish that there were more options for hanging toys...here, they attach with velcro to a small hanging strap rather than a typical loop that you can attach a link to. The giraffe is pretty cute : )  The colors, while bright, are not as obnoxious as the square Rainforest playmat. Another bonus is that this disassembles and folds up pretty compactly.

When she was first born, and not sleeping through the night at all, we just kept turning it on over and over to get her used to the music to calm her back to sleep. Originally we tried the rainforest sounds option, but it didn't do much for her. The music however is nice and calming and didn't bother us even though she slept in the same room. It goes through all three songs and lasts about 20 minutes, usually the amount of time it takes her to fall asleep. The remote makes it handy to switch it back on while we're still in bed or to pop in to turn it on from the living room. Since she's older we don't use the movement part of the mobile anymore, just the music but she still enjoys looking at them and hasn't fussed with them much when she stands so it's still there. When she was smaller the music and the mobile spinning helped her fall to sleep and it gave us the opportunity to tell her what the different animals were and the colors.

Both mobiles are well designed and are absolutely adorable.  Pros for the Rainforest  The head piece that dangles over the baby is a lot more intricate compared to the precious planet model. The leaves droop up and down as the stuffed animal rotate around it. There is a lot more visual stimulation when there is good lighting in the room.  The sound options are all pleasant from classical musical choices and a rainforest sound.  Cons for the Rainforest  While the head price is more intricate than the precious planet, more moving parts means greater chance of something breaking down in the future. A lot of neg feedbacks from amazon and Fischer price suggests that this mobile can break down for those few unlucky owners.  The attachment to the crib is not as flexible compared to the precious planet. The mount consists on a large plastic screw that you place between the railing and the back mounting nut. The mobile has a hinge that must rest on a horizontal surface. If you have a crib with curves or a thick top railing, you will be limited on where you can place this mobile. Also as you are screwing the back bolt onto the mobile, I'm worried about scratching the crib. A towel or something soft can prevent this, but becomes a hazard if your little one tries to grab or pull on it. The precious planet uses a snap on strap so you can mount it anywhere on your crib.  Pros for precious planet  While head piece does not have the wow factor of the rainforest, the mobile projects aminal pictures to the head piece, which reflects back down to the baby. During the day time, I prefer the rainforest. At low lighting conditions the precious planet wins.  The mobile can attach anywhere on the crib, while the rainforest needs a flat railing surface.  Might have better longevity because once the baby gets older and the head price is removed, the animal projector will reflect off the ceiling.  Cons  Not as cute compared to the rainforest from stuffed animals to head piece design.  Overall they are both great mobiles.  Precious planet is better for low lighting conditions and cribs with curvy or thick railings.  Rainforest has better stimulation for babies in well lit conditions.",2011-12-30

US,52445791,R2LHWYGNWGQJJA,B005FPT51K,555425298,iBaby Monitor M3 WiFi Digital Video Monitor with Night Vision and Two-way Audio for iPhone and Android,Baby,4.0,267.0,274.0,N,N,Works for what I want it for.,"This product generally reviews poorly on various sites - so much so that had I researched it prior to picking it up on impulse at the local Apple store (figuring I could return it if necessary), I probably wouldn't have bothered. That said, I'm not sure if there have been upgrades since some of the early terrible reviews, but it seems to work fine for me. Setup wasn't difficult at all - following the instructions in the iBaby app resulted in an easy setup in about five minutes. I will say that I suspect some of the dissatisfied customers didn't understand that it has to be set up the first time with a wired connection to your router (cable is included, which is slightly surprising, but nice), but then can simply be unplugged and moved wherever you want it. I've had no significant trouble (except see below) accessing the camera on my local WiFi, over the Internet from different WiFi networks, or via AT&T's 3G network, with the expected latency depending on access method. I'll say that I'm not particularly fluent with wireless networking or webcams, so I would have returned the thing long before messing around with port forwarding or any of the other 'advanced user settings' that people have described having to use for various iOs based video monitors.   Beyond the quick setup guide included with the iBaby app, though, the documentation was comically bad. The device came packaged with a CD containing a PDF users guide, which appears to have been translated from Chinese either by a human who's never spoken to a native English speaker or by a computerized translation program. This quality of manual would be embarrassing for a $20 clock/radio bought at CVS. For an almost $200 device aimed at new parents and sold in the Apple Store, it's absolutely appalling. Honestly, how hard can it really be, even for a company based in China, to find a high school or college student who is a fluent speaker of both English and Mandarin to translate the frickin manual? It would probablycost about $1000!   The quality of the image itself was more than adequate - even surprisingly good with the night vision. Audio was acceptable - not as good as the Angelcare audio monitor we have, but acceptable. The iBaby app is somewhat basic, but intuitive and works fine (although I haven't tried to add a second camera yet); allows easy panning and tilting with a finger swipe as well as capturing a snapshot to your iPhone or iPad. I'm less impressed by the audio and movement alerts - not so much because they don't work as because it plays poorly in the sandbox with the iOs device's desire to be locked and asleep - I suspect it would work fine if you plugged it in and left the screen on without using the device for anything else, but who really wants to do that? The app claims you can leave it on and it will continue to function with the screen asleep; the time I tried that it resulted in waking up in the morning to a screen full of multiple text alerts (the audible alert seems not to have sounded, and given how loud it is I'm pretty sure I would've woken up) followed ultimately by a warning that the connection to the camera had been lost.   Which leads me to my bottom line about the device, and probably the source of a lot of dissatisfaction. The iBaby, and probably iOs-based baby video monitors in general, are not quite ready for prime time if you want to depend on it as your *only* method of monitoring the baby, particularly if you have medical concerns or anything. We use it in conjunction with our Angelcare audio monitor, which has always worked perfectly without problems; basically, we use the iBaby video to *check on* the baby, not so much to *monitor* the baby. (I.e., once we've heard her cry or whatever, to answer the question of \\""What in the world is she *doing* in there?\\"" without having to go in the room.) This is not the iBaby's fault so much as it is the fault of WiFi in general - I don't know how it is for other people, but our WiFi is a little unstable - it's not terribly uncommon for it to drop signal or kick a laptop or our BluRay player off the network. For most devices, this simply results in a freeze for a few seconds while the device signs back on to WiFi; for the iBaby, you pretty much have to do it manually by closing the app and opening it again. This is slightly frustrating but no big deal if you're using it like we are, but you can see how people would hate it if the iBaby were their only monitor.   I can compare the device to the Summer Infant BabyTouch, which reviews very well; we inadvertantly purchased both at the same time. The iBaby has slightly better video quality and slightly worse audio quality than the Summer Infant, although both were adequate. (It's not HD, but for a little webcam with night vision, what do you want?) The Summer Infant has a (digital) zoom that's not very useful, whereas the iBaby does not. Controlling the camera is much better with the iBaby. The Summer Infant has a built in speaker that you can use to talk back through it; somewhat deceptively, the iBaby doesn't (what it has is a *connection* for an external speaker that you have to buy separately), but we don't really feel like that's all that important. The iBaby has the above problems with unstable WiFi connections, whereas the Summer Infant worked perfectly out of the box, never losing connection even for a moment. They're similarly priced; some reviwers have described the iBaby as grossly overpriced, which it probably is if you have the networking skills to buy a Foscam for about $100, an iOs based app for $5-10 to drive it, and set it up on your wireless network. I don't, and I have better uses for the several hours (and probably having to purchase a book on wireless networking) that it would take me to figure it out; I'd rather just pay the extra money.   So why did we keep the iBaby and send the Summer Infant back? Because the Summer Infant reliably - although not instantaneously, which is interesting - fried our WiFi network and made all sorts of devices, from networked printers to our BluRay player, to my wife's laptop, completely useless because of poor connection. Now, it's been suggested that this problem can be solved by changing the channel on your router (we use a Cisco Linksys E3000), but again, I really don't want to be spending my time playing sysadmin for my wireless network when it's clearly the fault of a specific device with a noisy signal. We'll keep our reliable Angelcare sudio monitor for workhorse use and our iBaby for visual checking in, thanks.",2012-01-07

I think it is the movement of the leaves that keeps his attention because the motion is large enough for him to focus on at this young age.

Yes, it's just about the cutest mobile I've ever seen but it's a wind up and the music is extremely loud and fast (mary had a little lamb).

It also has a nightlight that you can turn on or off.  And the whole thing comes with a remote control which is nice so the baby doesn't see you turning the mobile back on.

It attaches in 4 places and just feels more stable and structured, and the inner part zips closed.  If your stroller is very upright, though, this works fairly well.  In its favor, the main compartment is somewhat larger, and the drink parts will hold slightly bigger drinks.

The talk back feature is nice, although with a slight delay (to be expected).<br /><br />What I like:<br />* Music feature is nice, but could use some more songs<br />* I like the iPhone/iPad app<br />* Pinch and zoom feature is okay, but I can do the same thing with Sharx camera, although they work a little differently.  The quality increases slightly on the Withings camera where the Sharx camera has no quality gain, but also doesn't need to refresh.<br />* Frame rate seems to stay fairly smooth when connected through ethernet. It's slightly better than Sharx when viewing on iPad.<br />* Portability - This is a nice bonus (1 hour of video on battery) but I don't cover this in my review because I would only use this 1% of the time.<br />* Wireless quality and frame rate don't degrade too much compared to Ethernet (with a good signal).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />* My main gripe is that I can't view the video on my computer.  I believe Withings has said this feature is coming in the future.<br />* Video quality - not on par with the Sharx camera I own in quality.<br />* Night Vision quality not as good as Sharx.  I would say the Sharx camera night vision is A LOT better actually. The Withings IR lights are too bright in the middle.<br />* No option to force IR mode on/off.<br />* No option to turn off audio on iPhone.  This could be fixed with a firmware update, but not sure if it will ever happen.<br />* Delay - I noticed maybe a 1.5 second delay when connected through ethernet.  A little under 2 seconds wireless.  Sharx delay is almost no delay when viewing on a computer, and less than a half second on iPad. These numbers are with a fairly strong wireless N connection.<br />* Sharx is a half second faster on WiFi than Withings is connected through Ethernet when viewing both on the iPad. I don't mind a small delay, and even 1 second to me isn't that bad.<br /><br />For a baby video monitor, I don't think you need HD quality (Sharx is only 640x480).  You mainly just need to see the baby and be able to tell if they are moving, awake, pacifier out, etc.  The Withings monitor is definitely good enough to be able to see all of this.  The Sharx camera is noticeably better which is a nice bonus. The Withings camera has a wider angle of view than Sharx.  Sharx certainly has a lot more options - continuous recording, snapshots, dydns setup, etc.  Sharx does involve more network knowledge to setup, where the Withings is easier to setup out of the box.<br /><br />If you are not experienced in network setup, DHCP reservation, dyndns configuration, don't mind slightly lower quality, and don't need to view it on a computer (yet), and don't mind a slight lag, the Withings monitor is decent.  If you are a more advanced user, want better quality, instantaneous feedback, and more advanced options, Sharx would be the way to go.  If Withings optical quality was a little better, and I could view it on a computer, it might be a different story, but I think I am going to keep the Sharx unit.  The portability, and iPhone/iPad integration is pretty cool and nerdy, but Sharx still looks better using Safari browser in iPad than Withings does with their app.  I really hope Withings does well with this, because I think they could make a lot better 2.0 product, and a little more work.  That said, it isn't a bad initial offering in my opinion.<br /><br />The biggest deal breaker is Withings charges to view away from home. I think 15 minutes each day are provided free.  My wife loves the setup of the Sharx so she can see her baby when she has time at work.  I would like it if Withings allowed a dns setup so I could use my own bandwidth for away-from-home use.<br /><br />6-1-2012 *I guess Withings has allowed unlimited viewing away from home which is nice, but it should have been offered in the first place.  I still stand by my 3 star review*<br /><br />There are many many other video cameras, IP cameras, & Baby monitors on the market.  These are just the two that I have used.  Actually, I have used the AngelCare monitor as well, but that has the worst quality of all, even though it has a nice portability factor.",2012-03-08

From the packaging to product design, the Apple influence is very apparent. I've been a frustrated user of two previous baby monitors. Before buying those, I did a good deal of research and each seemed to be the best on the market at the time. Well, now the market's changed. To start, the features cannot be beat, including some you'd see in other monitors: infrared night vision, the ability to talk through the monitor, temperature and humidity monitoring - and some that you might not: a night light that can change to any color in the RGB spectrum with a full intensity slider, completely customizable alerts for motion, sound, temperature & humidity (you can set the alert ranges), music that can be controlled from your phone (start, stop, volume & timer), digital zoom and panning, and charting of conditions history and record of alerts throughout the night.<br /><br />The setup was remarkably easy. It's probably slightly more difficult than your standard video monitor but given the technology involved, it's amazing how well they've designed setup. For instance, over bluetooth, your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad will send information about your WiFi connection to the monitor to get it connected the first time.<br /><br />The picture is very good - not great - but very good. It's definitely the best among video monitors I've seen. I think the resolution is sufficient, but the light sensor could benefit from being more sensitive. It seems to have to switch over to infrared too easily. The audio quality is also very good - better than our previous monitors.<br /><br />My wife and I each own an iPhone and because our phones are usually already with us, it's very convenient to be able to pull up the monitor on an app instead of having a separate monitoring device. When a sitter is over, we'll be able to show them how to use the iPad to do the same thing. So far, nighttime monitoring with the app running in the background has been working mostly without hitches. My wife told me that it stopped one night, but it hasn't happened again since - so I'm not sure what the deal was there.<br /><br />Being able to monitor it while you're away from home could come in handy. They only allow 15 minutes of monitoring per day from outside your home's connection for free, which is slightly disappointing. However, it should be sufficient for checking in on your little one who's home with the sitter while your away a few times. I don't know that there would be a need for letting the audio run while your out of the home - but you never know.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy. It's more expensive than other video monitors on the market, but the value is outstanding considering all you're getting. It'll be nice to see them fine tune and expand the software with time as well - which wouldn't be possible with most other monitors.",2012-03-14

I bought a bunch of baby wipes in bulk that did not come with a case/dispesener plus I wanted something that was portable enough to take to doggie parks or anywhere on the go to clean up puppy messes or other things so I ordered this.  This case has been super handy so far.<br /><br />It's not cute (which I would have liked), but it is durable and it seems to hold a good amount of wipes...maybe a forth to a third of the conents of one of the packs I ordered. The strap is a nice addition although we will probaby keep it in the doggie backpack with all the other dog stuff we carry around when we have the dog.  I think it would fit nicely around a stroller handle or secure nicely to a shopping cart.  Because it is see-through it is easy to tell when you need to refill.<br /><br />The dispenser works well and the wipes pull out nice and cleanly.  I think if you overfilled it, that may be a problem because you would have to shove the end of a wipe back in, but just don't overfill and it should be fine.  The top closes with a click (it is a hinged-type of closer) and I have not had any probems with the wipes drying out (but so far they have not been kept in really hot or humid environments for long). The red button slipes easily for me and the contents seem to be secure and do not shift much (but this may also have to do with the quality/thickness of wipes you buy...mine where either huggies or pampers.  I don't remember but a name brand wipe).<br /><br />So far I am pleased. Nice for one-handed access to clean dirty paws or bottoms.",2012-03-29

US,46452279,R1X0DJIUOYOVJG,B0069JBKHI,981374473,"Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White",Baby,2.0,351.0,368.0,N,N,Really Wanted This to Be Good,"Just want to start this off by saying I really wanted this to work well.  My daughter was born in the fall and when looking for a baby monitor, I saw the Withings unit and loved the concept, Issue was at the time it was not out yet.  As soon as I got the email in Jan that it was released for the US I bought the unit.  I didn't rashly post an immediate review since I hate when people do that, so this is now my reflection after a good 2 months of use.<br /><br />Unfortunately I tried every which way to fall in love with this product, but I did have to finally return it.  There are definitely a lot of positive aspects of the unit and the SW, but a few negatives that in the end of the day made me realize this product just isn't ready for prime time.  The biggest problem is that if the unit isn't near 100% reliable, its not worth the risk when dealing with an infant.  I found myself constantly running this monitor as well as my other monitor as a backup, which is not a long term solution.<br /><br />So very quickly after unboxing I was set up, that truly was a breeze.  You initially connect via Bluetooth, but then set up over WiFi.  Had the unit set up over 3 devices (Ipad, Iphone, and Ipod touch).  I eagerly awaited the first night to test this out.<br /><br />So first reactions and several positives:<br />1. Loved the way the app worked in the background.  It didn't tie up the device, or the battery, yet still notified you and let you hear the monitor<br />2. The trending, while limited to 15 minutes, was cool to see graphically the activity on the motion and noises<br />3. The history log as well was great to see the patterns that occur through the night, be great if this could also be graphed, but that's just SW App development<br />4. The temp and humidity monitoring were also good, this was the first unit I could find that did both along with having iphone integration.<br />5. The music and lights are really bells and whistles, I don't use them, but its added features<br /><br />Most of my cons are really product design and quality.  This wouldn't be the first time I saw a great idea, for a rather expensive product fail on product quality.  Rather upsetting, but also tells me there is no hope for it being fixed until a later release.<br /><br />1. The unit is basically a large clam shell.  Its actually even a bit bigger then I expected.  When you fold it up, you literally have to point it straight forward otherwise the base gets in the way of the image.  This literally cut out about 30-40% of my crib.  After one or two times of my child crying, but being out of view I had to change something.  I literally had to make a white finished wooden wedge with a rubber top and a Velcro strap to angle the entire withings unit down to capture most of the crib.  It was better, but you shouldn't have to do that for a $300 monitor.<br />2. The night vision is really sub-par.  Man nights it took squinting to see if the baby was on her back or her stomach.  Average would have been OK, but I didn't expect it to be substantially worse that run of the mill video units.  Again, for $300 why not beef this up.<br />3. I was actually able to deal with the first 2 issues, but #3 was the game breaker.  The unit is not stable.  It disconnects and buffers endlessly on occasion. This is not anything I was comfortable taking a risk on.  I'd say realistically it was about 5-15% of the time, meaning one morning every 1-2 weeks I would awake to find out that I was not monitoring my baby all.  Scary right?  Literally the application would say you have been disconnected with your monitor and could not be reconnected.  Some times the unit buffered and never would let you actually begin monitoring.  Not all the time, but enough for me to not take a risk of not having a monitor.<br />4. From my experiences above, I can also tell you there is no quick support resolution.  You cannot call the company.  You must email and get a response back anywhere from 1-5 days.They are helpful when you get them, but being in a different time zone it was at least a day to troubleshoot each step.<br /><br />To elaborate more on #3.  The unit has Bluetooth connectivity in case the WiFi fails.  This never is sustainable, even just one room away.  My router, the monitor and the device in most cases were withing 25 feet of each other.  I even tried the unit at someone else's house to see if its my network.  I ran into the same issues.  Sometimes shutting down the apps completely and relaunching helped, but I cannot do that when I'm sleeping!  Eventually I was simply told that it would not get better and I should return the unit.  Again, any other device, I'd chalk it up to being n early adopter and take the pros and cons, but with my child, there is no risks worth taking.<br /><br />I'm hoping this helps those on the fence and also gets some attention to look at the product quality.  Like I opened with, I truly wanted this to work as I love the concept and the features.They are helpful when you get them, but being in a different time zone it was at least a day to troubleshoot each step.<br /><br />To elaborate more on #3.

My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",2012-04-28

It was very easy to setup, at least for me. The video does have a good bit of lag/latency and the quality is not as good as I expected. My home network does not use \\""consumer/home\\"" grade products such as 99% of the individuals who would be using a product like this as it is not cost effective to have 10K bucks in networking equipment for home connectivity. This was running over a pure Cisco enterprise level network with Cisco Aironet AP's with QOS setup to give the camera/video traffic priority over any other type of traffic but that only gave me a slight performance increase. The Aironet series also uses \\""clean air technology\\"" so interference from other sources is non existent . I also tried it on the wired side plugged into a Cisco Catalyst 3750 switch and still the same results. The audio had a pretty big lag as well and when playing the lullaby and listening to it over the iPhone/iPad there was a ton of overlap if you were anywhere close to being able to hear both at the same time; This was due to the latency. I think it is a great concept but the codec's need to be adjusted and the frame rate increased. We also purchased the Motorola setup to compare and even though I can't access it from \\""anywhere\\"" the voice/video has zero latency and it just flat out works out of the box which will keep my wife happy. I will set up one of my HD Axis camera's for local and remote viewing that is not limited to Apple products; also this will be free for me and will produce MUCH voice and video quality that the Withings unit can ever think about doing..

I thought I would throw mine into the loop as well.<br />Firstly, my daughter loves this, she plays with it and watches it and overall really enjoys it.<br />Many people complain that this is too quiet, here is my thoughts on it. The low volume is pretty quiet, especially the nature sounds, however it is definitely loud enough for baby. The high volume is loud, but not too loud. I can hear it in the hall, but with the door closed, I really have to listen for it. My daughter is use to a lot of noise, so the loud setting works well when she is just playing with it, the low volume for when she is trying to sleep.<br />Many people also claimed it does not fit on a convertible crib, I have a convertible crib and it fits fine. If you want it on the head/ foot board of the crib, it will not fit most cribs as they have a solid top these days. It is meant to go on the side of the crib- it fits well there if you have a straight edged crib. Essentially it has a big plastic bolt and washer- you put the bolt through the slats and spin on the washer until it's tight.<br />I have had this for about three weeks and I have not had any problems with any of the leaves as others have complained about, nor has the motor caused any problems. I am thinking those people just got a bad one, it happens but I don't think it should stop anyone from buying this. It is a great product!<br />My almost 3 month old use to hate being in her crib, awake or asleep, it was too big and open for her. Now that she has this mobile, she loves to watch it and play with it in her crib. She has started taking naps in her crib because of this mobile, it is now a friendly place for her (I am sure that would have happened over time, but it is great to have that happen now as she is outgrowing where she sleeps in now). My only complaint is I wish it had a continuous play mode as sometimes she wakes up when it turns off.<br /><br />***EDIT*** The motor justdied. We didn't even have it for a full month. Very disappointing, my daughter really liked this. At least it helped her learn to enjoy her crib. I was sad to return it, but at least Amazon makes it easy to return. Upon reading other mobile reviews it seems that Fisher Price motors die frequently.",2012-05-21

Thats what we concluded after reading the back story of the wubbanub. It would work if it was big enough, but its not. Very light weight and wont reach the crib bed when baby is on his back. Just kinda hangs there a bit til it falls out. Also has that made in china/ carnival prize type of quality feel to it. We found that the standard paci works better because with the wubbanub baby actually catches the stuffed animal with his arms when he flails them and it rips the paci out of his mouth.

It came out in January 2012 but my husband and I decided that it was a bit late in the game to be buying a new monitor, especially a $300 one, since our son was nearly a year old at the time.  However, 15 months to the day after we set it up, our old monitor gave out, so we decided to buy this one.<br /><br />+We love that my husband can check in on our son when he's at work or away on a trip.  I believe initially, you had to pay to view more than 15 minutes per day, but as of late May 2012, that doesn't seem to be the case.  My husband has been spying on the nursery all day long.<br />+I love not having to drag another thing around the house with me.  If the house is quiet, you can hear the baby anywhere, but you can't hear him over the TV.  It's really nice to just start the app on my iPhone when we turn a movie on, and not have to worry about going and dragging out the monitor handset, finding a place to plug it in AND set it up so we can see.  I just peek at my phone if we hear a noise, and check whether he's just stirring in his sleep or if there's a problem.<br />+Multiple devices at once!!  We have two iPhones and an iPad viewing him at the same time, very frequently.  I leave the iPad connected upstairs and never touch it, and use the iPhone app when I'm downstairs.  I haven't tried any more than that, but I haven't noticed any change in performance with more or less devices connected.<br />+Runs on a battery!  Sure, it won't last all night, but the sucker doesn't stop running when the power goes out or when you accidentally unplug it!  Apparently it's rated for one hour of video or two hours of audio monitoring, but I haven't tested that, and I'm not sure I will any time soon.<br />+ Easy to set up, right out of the box.  I plugged it in, turned it on, and was monitoring within 5 minutes.<br />+The alerts are awesome.  I love knowing what the temperature and humidity are in the room, and I can set up a motion alert that will wake me before my son gets upset in the mornings.<br />+Creepy disembodied voice feature lets you use the monitor like an intercom, and talk to your child.<br />+Lullaby feature is cute.  There aren't a ton of songs, but it's not a crib soother, it's a monitor.  It's a neat feature.<br />+The night light is 100% adjustable, and each color varies in brightness, so you can set what's right for you.  The night light does not appear to interfere with the camera's night vision.<br /><br />-Lag.  Unless the kid has a gun in the crib, a 1-second lag isn't going to be a problem, but it is annoying.  I've noticed that if you leave a device connected for an extended period of time, the lag time increases marginally, but if you turn monitoring off then back on, it goes away.  It's generally about .5-1 second in my house, over wifi connection.<br />-Design flaw in the night vision.  I noticed that the picture was very clear most of the time, but had a strange brightness to it when night vision was activated, but that sometimes it wasn't present.  As it turns out, the \\""night vision\\"" lights are reflected off of the shiny plastic base, and interfere with the camera.  I covered the base with a small piece of fleece I had lying around, and the night vision is incredibly clear.  It doesn't bother me, but for $300, I shouldn't have to do that.<br />-This is more of a note... the plug is kinda wiggly.  It's not normally an issue, but if you touch the monitor a lot, the plug can come loose from the base, and the camera will die.  Fortunately, the monitor tells you that!  And hopefully your little one is blissfully unconscious so you can sneak in and fix it.<br />-No discount for multi-room viewing.  A lot of monitors are set up in such a way that you can just buy an extra camera and view it on the same connection.  However, since this is an all-in-one bit, you have to buy the whole thing twice if you have two rooms to monitor.  I will probably never NEED two rooms monitored by video, but I probably would have bought the extra camera if it was offered (and cheaper), rather than using just a cheap audio monitor for the toddler when baby #2 comes along.<br /><br />=No REAL pan/zoom.  Our previous monitor had a joystick-controlled mechanical pan/zoom function.  This camera just uses a very wide angle lens to get the most complete picture possible, and you can digitally pan and zoom around that picture, but the camera never moves.  It hasn't been a problem for us, but there it is.<br />=Camera/base design flaw.  You do have to point the camera on the base at a certain angle, otherwise the base interferes in the camera, and you get even more of that awful glare.  When it comes to video baby monitors, this whole situation is tricky anyways, since there's the whole problem of trying to see over the rails of the crib.  No matter what, you're probably going to want the thing mounted high up, and pointing straight down.  This goes for any baby monitor.  Temporarily, we have ours propped up so that it's pointing kind of downward, but I'll be mounting it on the wall later.  It comes with an attachment to secure it to the crib, but that will only work for smaller babies who can't yet sit up and grab things.  :)<br />=iOS ONLY!  I'm not listing this as a negative item, because it is also positive, while it can possibly be inconvenient.  No, I can't watch from the computer (YET- rumor has it that Withings is working on this, and there may be an OSX app in the future).  However, this means that for anyone to be able to access my monitor, they have to be within range of it to make the initial connection, which then alerts all my devices that a connection has been made.  I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like I can disable accounts from viewing my monitor.<br /><br />Some people have reported problems getting connected and staying connected, but I haven't experienced it personally.  I also haven't needed to contact customer service, so I can't elaborate on that either.<br /><br />Overall, I like the monitor, and I'd still choose this one over others on the market.  It has a few minor issues, but they're more like annoyances, and there are no security issues or major flaws.  It would be a different story if the world of baby monitors was as advanced and high-demand as smartphones, but it's not.  And so far, this monitor is one of the best available.",2012-06-01

I understand that sometimes connections get interrupted the worst part for me is the app has never successfully reconnected on its own.  I can't tell you how many times I have woken up only to find the monitor not actually working.  If the connection is lost the app shouldn't stop until it reconnects and if it goes 5 minutes without being able to reconnect it should alert me saying \\""I am a piece of junk, i lost the connection and can't get it back.  Please quit the app and reconnect.\\""",2012-06-20

This was probably the deciding factor.  We set up the monitor when it arrived (prior to baby's arrival) and were so excited to use it.  A few other pluses we liked about the monitor:<br />-Ability to start music from iPhone/iPad<br />-Ability to talk to baby<br />-Temperature and Humidity information<br /><br />Unfortunately, when we started using the monitor in real life situations once our baby arrived home we found it less than acceptable.  We are returning the monitor for the following reasons:<br /> - main reason - it looses connection with the internet all the time and often says it can not reconnect<br /> - Range for bluetooth connection is not strong enough for our home, or to take monitors outside on back porch<br /> - Horrible feedback (very shrill) from the listening/audio monitoring<br /><br />For the price, this monitor should work like a DREAM!

It has a ton of great features like the temp, humidity, noise/movement graphs and more. Being able to have the monitor viewed on either of our iphones or ipad, was one of the top selling features.  Withings showed a lot of innovative in their design and execution of the Smart Baby Monitor, the price point seemed appropriate<br /><br />I've been using the monitor on my wife and baby while they sleep in the other bed room with a co-sleeper. I am doing this to be sure that the wi-fi and blue-tooth connection wouldn't be interrupted or drop off when we have the baby sleeping alone with just the monitor on him.<br /><br />Several times in the last week the monitor froze when monitoring mom/baby on the iPad (first generation wifi only, with wifi and bluetooth on). It looked like my wife was peacefully sleeping with the baby.  Really it seems that the connection was frozen.  A lot like in Ocean's 11 where they freeze the frame on a security camera while they break into the safe.<br /><br />Having the video and sound available on our iphone and ipad a great feature, but I would rather have a rock solid, uninterruptable connection between the video monitoring station and handheld viewer.<br /><br />This device needs to be 100% reliable in order for it to be useful for monitoring our child's safety.  If the reliability isn't addressed by the time we have the baby sleeping in the crib alone, then we will probably get another monitor.<br /><br />We've been using the monitor for 3 weeks, I will update this review in another 3-4 weeks.<br /><br />10/1/2012<br />We returned the monitor a few weeks after this review and got a Summer Infant Safe and Secure.

The software is iOS or browser based. The iOS app has improved dramatically over the past few months and is now very solid and responsive. The browser view is functional, but not great.<br /><br />The major downside of this camera for me is that it doesn't support IPv6, although that could probably be corrected with a firmware update.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />When I first purchased this camera I was very pleased with it. We've now had it for almost two years now. Here's what I've learned while using it.<br /><br />* The app is very flakey. Through OS upgrades it had compatibility issues several times and sometimes took a month or more before an update was available that corrected the problem.<br />* The app is prone to crashing<br />* The app controls are difficult to use. Sometimes screen widgets don't respond, sometimes it takes several taps. Sometimes the control's state and visible state get reversed (it will be on when shown as off, and off when shown as on).<br />* The camera is no longer discoverable from the app. I don't know if this is a problem with the app or the camera. I can still use the web view but the app is now useless.<br />* The manufacturer has never provided a firmware update for the camera, so still no IPv6 support.<br /><br />If you have the ability, I highly recommend getting a Raspberry Pi with a camera connector board. It's cheaper, works better and lasts longer. If that's not your thing, I still discourage buying this camera. Look for a better brand, hopefully one that will last longer.",2012-07-06

On a flat surface, our 4 month-old son still had the misfortune to tilt his body in a way that lifted the spinner up and it then came down on his fingers. Now, I want you to imagine the entirety of your body weight coming down with hard plastic edges on your fingers. Doesn't sound very forgiving pain-wise, does it? We didn't even know what was going on as we'd never heard him cry or scream like that before.<br /><br />Now we're sitting here with a screaming kid and wondering if we should take him to the doc since he goes back to screaming a minute after waking up.<br /><br />Sad thing is that I think he'd really be into this thing but if you can't bother to engineer a product that's marketed towards developing infants but doesn't prevent something like this happening to an infant, then you get 1 star from me. Yeah, it was also bad luck, but that's what preventative engineering is for.",2012-07-16

About four weeks after we got it, it stopped working.  The mobile would not rotate.  The music still played and the light worked but not the mobile.  The mobile is the most interesting part for little ones.  We exchanged it through Amazon (I got a replacement the next day) and it worked for a while... about 7 weeks and then it stopped rotating the same way the first one did.  It's out of stock on Amazon so we are receiving a refund instead of an exchange.  I am starting to think most of what Fisher Price makes is cheap junk.  They won't confirm what their products are made out of and everything seems to come from China.  I'll be looking for a better quality crib toy for my little sweetie.

Second, its the same brand pacifier he is use too.  He was given the \\""soothie\\"" type of pacifier when he was in the NICU and has been using only this brand since then.  Third, its easy to find if it drops or if you have twins like we do and need to easily distinguish whose is whose: my son has the monkey and my daughter the giraffe.

This is about the cutest guitar I've ever seen. It is sturdy enough for a young child to use and the extra small size makes it really nice for small hands. The frets are much too small for my average sized adult hands, but that is fine because I wanted it to fit hers.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has no value as an actual instrument. If your child just wants to strum some strings to make random noise then they will probably be happy. But as a guitar player myself, the first thing I tried to do was tune this and have it at least sound somewhat decent. Sadly, it simply cannot be tuned. The tuning pegs function in turning but as soon as you find the note you want and let go of the peg it unwinds itself enough that it is way out of key. I could not even get close to a tolerable tuning to play a single simple song that anyone would recognize. The strings are also strange, they have the appearance of bronze but when I tried to tune one up to a higher note it snapped easier than a nylon string. I was able to sort of repair it since the rest of the instrument doesn't actually function so no one will notice but all in all, for such a cute looking instrument it was a big disappointment.<br /><br />If you want a sturdy and cute toy just for fun then this is inexpensive and cute enough and to please any little girl but if you want a guitar with any real musical value, this is not it.<br /><br />**update**<br />Just broke a second string and they are unique to this guitar so I cannot simply replace the string like a normal one.

My husband found them in her crib next to her. I'm so glad she didn't put them in her mouth and choke! The monkey had a hole in him where the tags were and you could see the stuffing. Luckily we found it quickly and I sewed the hole up so she can still have her monkey. I cut the tags off her other wubbanub to prevent this from happening again. I wish they didn't have tags or they were sewn on better.

US,21614606,RSDFYLGN0MCVL,B005FPT51K,555425298,iBaby Monitor M3 WiFi Digital Video Monitor with Night Vision and Two-way Audio for iPhone and Android,Baby,1.0,1.0,2.0,N,Y,"Not yet ready for prime time! Not user-friendly, a lot of quirks. Do not buy.","We really wanted to love this monitor. It actually came recommended by some close friends and was high on our wish list of \\""nice-to-have\\"" baby gadgets. So we decided to \\""splurge\\"" on this monitor. The concept--using your smart phone/tablet to view your baby from anywhere you can get wifi--is spot-on and likely to be a big money maker for someone but this is not the product that will corner this market. The camera itself seems to be high quality and well built but it's all the software quirks that make this product pretty much useless. For starters, the App for iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod) that is required to use, view, control and setup the camera is clunky and far from user-friendly. I am in the marketing field and have seen my fair share of ugly/unusable apps but this one takes the cake. It almost feels unfinished--but in a state that should never have been released to the public, certainly no \\""working beta\\"" version since it barely works.<br /><br />Here are the issues with the app:<br />1. User interface is unappealing and clunky (like it was created in a very foreign language and *poorly* translated)<br />2. Difficult to locate settings and features--what should be straightforward is hidden in sub-menus, etc.<br />3. The software lags a LOT. And by lag I mean the time it takes for you to see/hear on your device what is caught on camera as well as the time it takes for your movement command to control the camera. On average we experienced a lag of 30+ secs but at times as much as 1 minute. Example: I set the alert feature to alert us when there was movement or sound in the room but even after jumping up and down, clapping and screaming in the room, the alert didn't hit my phone for at least a minute. In fact I had given up on it working and was in another room when it finally went off. This is a huge deal to me, I mean what is the good of a monitor if it doesn't monitor in real-time? For the rest of the functions (moving the camera, watching video) the lag was super annoying.<br />4. Hard (if not impossible--I didn't get it to work) to set up camera/wifi/router to allow camera to be viewed and controlled outside the home. Half the reason we got this was to be able to look in on our baby when my wife or I traveled. Setting up your network to allow this is not easy.<br /><br />Issues with the camera:<br />1. The camera has limited tilt. It was impossible to look down enough to get a good view into the crib<br />2. No speaker on camera unit. This means you have to attach your own external speaker to enable two-way audio. This is a very inelegant solution if you ask me.<br /><br />Due to our disappointment with this product we ended up returning to Amazon within a week or two and thankfully we received a full refund. We ended up buying a simple audio monitor made by VTech for $100+ less and love it. Here it is: [[ASIN:B007NG5UF4 VTech Communications Safe & Sound Digital Audio Monitor]]<br /><br />It just works--which cannot be said for the iBaby Monitor.",2012-08-31

They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.<br /><br />You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.<br /><br />This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price.

The tip of the antennas and legs are protected with a hard glue that can hurt their eyes when they are moving their hands close to their faces.

It seemed awesome at the time being able to monitor our baby from our iPhones thus eliminating the need to carry an extra monitor.  But, not more than two weeks later, the application stopped working on our iPhones.  The application on our iphones (4S) would kept showing \\""Connection Error Unable to retrieve Smart Baby Monitor connection information.\\""  My wife actually had found out that the monitor stopped working the next day when she saw this message on her phone.  I immediately contacted Wiithings and they responded within 24 hours.  Unfortunately, it was apparent that this was a known issue as support provided us with a PDF document on how to correct the problem!!  Being in IT, I could not bring myself to accept a product where a particular issue was so prevalent that a procedural guide was created on how to correct the problem.  In addition, it seemed that this issue would be reoccurring and not a one time fix.  Thoughts our of newborn daughter screaming through the night as we slept peacefully were playing through our minds.  The other thing that was annoying was the fact that there was a delay between what was seen/heard on the application and what was happening where the monitor was placed (baby room).  It was almost like watching something in slow motion as you could see the baby's arm move slowly from left to right like a someone flipping the pages of a book with a picture.  I am sure this was due to the Bluetooth connection but establishing a LAN line to the monitor was not something we were interested in doing.<br /><br />So, we sent the monitor back to Amazon who promptly refunded our purchase.

Let your baby be the judge.,"This mobile is hands down one of the top 5 BEST baby purchases I made! My son loves it so much that when the mobile stops spinning, baby just stares at it and starts crying for it to come back on again. It really has allowed him to enjoy his crib, and his room for a looong while.  Perfect in the morning when I need to get myself ready and he's got morning energy to expend. What makes this mobile so indispensable in our home:<br />- Batteries last a long time and we use this several times a day!<br />- The toys are very colorful and face down so when baby is lying in crib looking up, it's like they are dancing for him.<br />- 3 music / 1 rainforest noise options are all great and provide good change of pace for baby.<br />- the leaves open and close while the toys spin making this very 'interactive' and holds baby's attention for a looong time.<br />- The music and entertainment last a very long time (maybe 45 min? - I lose track of time while he's in his crib and it feels like hours :-) of 'free' time so I can get other things done<br />- Sometimes we get to add our own animal soundtrack as the animals spin and baby looves that too!<br />- Nightlight is a special touch!  Now, I've only turned on the nightlight several times when I was desperate to calm him down in his crib at bedtime and nothing else worked. He was mesmerized when he saw the light! So I use it as a treat. Eventually when (and if) he tires of the mobile, we will use the nightlight more. But it's great to have this added option to extend the life of the product.<br /><br />One challenge: the leaves and the spinning can get stuck after a few months of play. We opened one up and the inside parts are made of plastic. It looked like the lubricant used to make the gears run smoothly were dried up. So adding more lube will get this back to normal. It's a little tough to put back together and takes patience. But what a worth-it product!!!!!",2012-11-03

I'm am so thrilled!  I've struggled with it for a year, still loving the monitor despite it's imperfect performance on iOS6 and the iPhone 5.  It really is a one of a kind monitor!  I also love that you can finally view the monitors (at the same time) from any computer.  This is huge!!!<br /><br />Favorite features: the two way talking feature, the light (I used a green & red light to show my toddler when it was time to sleep and when it was time to get out of bed), and being able to remote monitor.  These three features made the monitor unique, even among other iPhone compatible monitors.<br /><br />The two main complaints I've seen in reviews on various sites about this monitor are true, tho neither were deal breakers for me-<br />1) the monitor shuts down/ loses connectivity once or twice a night, and if you're sleeping you don't know this has occurred, which is troubling if you're monitoring a small child.  I just solve this by using a cheap ($15ish) audio only monitor during the night. If baby wakes, I hear him on the audio monitor and can then turn on this monitor to see what he's doing.  I'm totally fine with this arrangement.<br />2) The night vision isn't awesome, but I've used several other regular video monitors and didn't find this one any worse than those.  Certainly the closer to the child the camera is, the clearer the picture is.  Sometimes the night vision adjusts itself and makes the picture a lot darker (making the picture very hard to see) or a lot brighter (which shows the child clearer).  You can't adjust the night vision yourself, it just does it on its own, and not always for the better.  However, all in all, the night vision is fine.  I appreciate being able to see even my child's outline.<br /><br />Note: When using with more than 1 monitor, there is NOT a great way of switching between monitors- there are about 7 key strokes to get between monitors and you have to do it manually.  It doesn't rotate between monitors automatically.  That makes viewing on the computer nice.  I think of this monitor as my way to see my kids napping during the day and at night when I'm away from home (say on a date and a babysitter is home viewing on my iPad or computer).  I love that I can see my kids sleeping when I'm not home with them.

She also learned to replace the pacifier a lot faster with the frog to hold onto.  We love our wubbanub.  I read some reviews about washing it--I throw it in the washing machine.

This product, however, has earned my first review....and it is a terrible one.  I have never before been so frustrated with a customer service experience and product expereince as this one. Perhaps it is my fault for thinking that a \\""mom and pop\\"" company could produce a product that every parent wants and no other company offers.  Apparently the reason that no other company offers this (as of yet) is because it is terribly difficult to do so with any consistency of success).  Let me admit, that there is some success but for many it simply wont work, or wont work very long.  My brother in law bought one of these first and had so much difficulty in setting it up (he is not a technical idiot either) that he had to call in his friend who is works for an internet servce provider as a Technical Support Manager to eventually get it set up.  It took this guy 5 HOURS to set it up and he is an expert...he told my brother in law that he cant believe they actually sell this product to the general public!  IN SPITE OF THIS....i bought one (stupid, i know), hoping that i would be one of the lucky ones.  Here is my story:<br />FIRST one i bought was delivered as new, but was actually used (this is not necessarily iBaby's fault, but the sellers).  It had some sort of strawberry jelly on it and was missing the installations CD).  I never even tried it and returned it.<br />SECOND one i got arrived new as advertised....unfortunately even new it didnt work.  After calling their \\""customer service\\"" number (WHICH is really just an answering machine that you have to wait days to hear back from) and troubleshooting for 2 sessions over 4 days, they advised that i had received a \\""lemon\\"" and that i should return it.<br />THIRD one i received, started off better then either of the first 2.  It actually worked, BUT ONLY OVER MY LOCAL WIFI NETWORK...not remotely (which is why i bought this).  At first, i figured it was just my settings and that i could fix it later.  I called \\""customer service answering machine\\"" again (twice) and finally got a call back where i was told i would have to email customer service the info (dont know why i couldnt explain it over the phone?)  I did email and heard back pretty quickly...ahh relief. That relief was short lived, when i followed their intstrustions to only discover that it still didnt work.  emailed again, got more instructions...still didnt work.  emailed again and was asked to send screenshot photos of my router settings.  they then told me that (and i am QUOTING THEM), \\""you have everything set up correctly and i dont know why it would work?\\""  THis entire process has taken almost an entire month and probably more then 20 hours of work and i still dont have a working ibaby camera and have no direction from their customer service to solve this.  PARENTS, please do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  it is terrible.  my suggestion is to wait until a larger company tackles this product idea and buy theirs.",2012-11-21

At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It.

When we went out of town, we were able to \\""spy\\"" on the grandparents that took care of her to make sure that she was down for her nap/bedtime when we suggested.  This is a total gem for when you leave your child with a sitter and expect them to follow your sleep schedule guidelines.  We are able to sooth our daughter if we are unavailable (as in my husband's case on Sunday nights).<br /><br />My love for this product was before a situation happened, but I love the company even more now.  We were cleaning our daughter's room when the power supply cord was accidentally broken out of the socket.  We were devastated because no other power supply we had came in handy and we had been without the product for a few months when I decided to email their support with the situation, I told them that we would not mind paying for a replacement part.  The customer service representative asked me for my shipping address and let me know the company would be sending one out immediately.  We were so shocked at how fast of a response and the fact that the company would send it free of charge.  Great job, Withings!",2012-12-05

I also have one that I attached to the top bunk of my boys' bunk bed. It works perfectly and he now has a place to put his water bottle, some tissues, a flashlight, etc. I always strongly recommend this cupholder to family, friends, and inquiring strangers. It is well made for the price. And since it is so economical it's affordable to replace it if it happens to get ruined. My favorite part is probably the wire around the opening. It allows me to easily place drinks inside, and I can usually do it one handed. That can't be said for the Skip Hop competitor to this product.

You can only view, continuously, from a cellular network for 5 minutes at a time. I can't find a good reason for this.<br />2. You can't play YOUR music to the baby.

It has two sound levels so you can have it very quiet or louder, but not too loud. The light emitted is perfect for nighttime, it's enough to let the baby to gaze into it but not too bright. The remote is fantastic for those times when it does cut off before your child's asleep and for someone who sleeps with the babies in the same room, I can turn it on from my bed in the middle of the night if little one rouses. I not only use it to soothe for naptime and bedtime, but also just for play; both of my little guys loved to lay in their crib and stare up at the mobile and kick their legs and smile and coo and laugh.

To be honest, I was a bit afraid of purchasing this since I've read some reviews about connectivity issues.  However, there aren't many choices out there which allows remote connection from outside of your home so I took a gamble and I must say that so far I am pleasantly surprised on how well it works.<br /><br />1st, I am not the geekiest person in the world, I am a 34 yr old working mom, do know a little about computers/networks.  I've actually set up the monitor (in less than 10 min) without any help from Hubby. I do want to mention that for those of you experiencing dropped connections over wifi, you may want to try assigning Static IPs on each device that has access to your WiFi.  Currently, we have more than 10 various devices (computers/laptops/tablet/iPhones/PS3,Wii,XBox, etc) accessing our home WiFi network and in the past we've encountered &#34;hand-shake&#34; issues when allowing the router to randomly assign IPs (we would loose connections on these devices).  After doing some research, we switched to a method which we assigned a unique IP address for each device that's connected to our WiFi and we have not encounter any issues since then.<br /><br />I also downloaded the BETA version of the Android app on my Sony Tablet and the only time I lost connection is when I place the tablet back on the cradle for charging.  This is not a huge issue for me since I typically have the Sony Tablet in the cradle next to my bed and as long as it is continuously in the cradle, I don't loose connections.<br /><br />I've also tested the iPhone app over 4G network while I was out doing some shopping, again no connection issue and I can see my baby just fine (though video quality is a bit lower than WiFi).<br /><br />Also, you can have multiple devices accessing the Video/Audio feed at the same time which is a very nice feature.  This allows me and hubby to monitor our son while the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update.hile the both of us are at work in separate locations.<br /><br />Recommendations to Withings:  Please allow us to manually control IR via the app, this can probably done through a simple software update.",2012-12-09

My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest.<br /><br />I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth.<br /><br />The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached.

Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.

Comparably priced toys in local stores are much less entertaining.<br />- Appears to be well made.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- None so far!<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- When washing this or any other baby toy I strongly recommend using a baby-specific laundry detergent such as [[ASIN:B004HCUMAA Dreft Baby Laundry Detergent Liquid, 32 Loads, 50-Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B005W2MVJ4 Dapple Fragrance-Free Baby Laundry Detergent 2x - 50 oz]].<br />- Keep an eye on the small mirror.

He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his \\""bewitching hour\\"", a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.",2013-01-26

Had the webcam so it was free. Worked fine for the first year. Saw this at a friends house and loved having the night vision.

The app guides you through everything and I had it fully functioning in the first five minutes. The picture is great, specially in the dark. Now I just need to get it mounted on the wall where it's convenient.<br />The only problem we've noticed is the audio. Right now there is a clicking going on but I think it's because it's sitting next to the old laptop running Skype. I'll move it tomorrow after he wakes up and see if it fixes it.<br />After reading reviews, I didn't think the alerts worked very well but after testing for a couple minutes, it seems they work great. We put him down and he was moving around. I was watching him on my phone and set the sensitivity for the motion alert and within 30 seconds, my wife's phone was ringing an alert. I'm not interested to use it all the time but I think it will come in handy at times.<br />There's no visible light coming from the camera and you can't even see it sitting in a dark room. I think the posts that say they see a light may have the led light turned on. Haven't exactly figured out what this is but I think it may turn on an extra light.

It turns the mobile back on to whatever lights/music combo you last had it set at (mobile plays for 15 minutes and then automatically shuts off). HOWEVER. The remote will only work to turn the mobile on/off for one hour since the last time you pushed a button on the actual mobile itself.

The manual winding however barely runs the mobile for approx10 secs, and as my kids loved it so much,I thought I'll buy a battery operated one... When I received this, I thought it was beautiful.. Vibrant colors, the palm fronds moving up and down, and the remote.. HOWEVER , my kids did not enjoy it as much.. The animals are way too close to each other, there are just too many things clustered together...and the strings from which the animals hang are way too short.....they will stare at the manual one which is simpler, just 4 animals on a longer string , it helps them distinguish the figures easily..

But this one just doesn't cut it as much.. The music however is nice, still not as nice as the manual one, and I felt the sound was a little low ..",2013-03-07

Like other reviewers said it kept getting stuck and wouldn't turn. However, I emailed Fisher Price about the problem and they IMMEDIATELY sent me a new mobile for free. It arrived a couple days after I sent the email with an apology. It was by far the best customer service experience I have ever had. I am really impressed.<br />Now for the review of the working mobile. It is really great. The music it plays is really soothing and puts my baby right to sleep. I also love the remote to turn the music off. I rock the baby near the crib/mobile and then when he falls asleep I turn the mobile off with the remote and then put the baby in the crib. Perfect.<br />When the baby wakes up he likes to stare up at the little moving creatures and leaves that go up and down. So it entertains him for a while, which I love. Like I said - I can't live without it...now that it works.",2013-03-08

Probably my most favorite feature is the fact I can talk to my baby while I am at work and watch her look back at me through the camera.  The temperature and humidity reader is great to make me aware of the temp and humidity in her room especially at night.  I can monitor it and make adjustments if needed.  The night light and noise maker are fantastic for helping my baby sleep.  Sometimes she just looks at the night light (we have it set on changing colors) until she falls asleep.  The video monitor has been so helpful for night-time to ensure my baby is safe, and to see what the problem may be when she is crying before I have to get up out of bed.

It's a sickness, I know. Anyhow, I scoured the internet to find the perfect wipes container because I was sure that it was out there...and this one, though riddled with problems, is the closest that I have come to the perfect wipes container.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1) I love the design. It looks modern, contemporary and cute.<br /><br />2) The strap it contains to hang it on your stroller is awesome! It prevents me from having to dig for wipes in the bottom of my diaper bag constantly when I just need to quickly grab a wipe to clean the baby's hands.<br /><br />3) This case holds a lot of wipes, is made of strong, thick plastic and is easy to clean. I hate the thin and poorly made travel Huggies wipes cases that I have used before, which are made from flimsy cheap plastic because you can barely fit any wipes in them. In contrast, the Skip Hop wipes container allows you to store a good amount of wipes in it and its plastic case is very sturdy.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1) The red button that closes the Skip Hop wipes container is CONSTANTLY popping off! And as soon as it pops off the baby will inevitably grab the red button and throw it in a fountain or in some bushes or in some other crazy location which means that I have to hunt around for 10 minutes to find that button.<br /><br />2) When it does stay on, the red button sticks and is hard to slide from open to closed, and vice versa. So, when you are sitting there trying to change the wiggling baby with one hand and trying to open or close this wipes container with the other hand, you can just forget about it. There is no easily accessing the wipes in this container without tugging on the container and causing the red button to pop off into oblivion!<br /><br />3) Wipes tend to dry out if left in this case. The red button closure doesn't seem to seal the wipes in the case in an airtight fashion so if you leave the wipes in the case, you can go to grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe. Not fun!<br /><br />My message to Skip Hop is this: Listen, this could be a GREAT case. You just have to work on increasing the functionality of that troublesome red button and you will have an almost perfect product.<br /><br />To those considering buying this case, call me crazy, but I would still definitely buy it again! Even with some quirks, it is still the best case out there in my opinion. No other case is as stylish as the Skip Hop case, or holds as many wipes with the added bonus of clipping onto the stroller like the Skip Hop case. I just recommend being vigilant about making sure to not lose the red closing button and I recommend adding a bit of extra water to your wipes if you leave them in the case for several days as they may dry out a bit. Follow those tips and voila, you have a fabulous wipes case.o grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe.

They were each given a Wubbanub in the NICU.  Fast forward to 2013 and I have a new nephew born 11 weeks premature.  I just ordered him the monkey. The best thing about these are that babies, especially preemies, is that they can guide the pacifier much easier on their own, honing their hand/eye coordination.<br /><br />The big downside is that they pacifier can not be removed from the stuffed animal.

The other was just toss it in the washer with my kids clothing.  When it was all washed and dried, I simple boiled some water and sterilized the pacifier.<br /><br />My girls no longer use the pacifier, of course, but they still have them and their baby dolls \\""use\\"" them now.",2013-04-04

When I first set it up around March 2012, it was ok, not perfect, but it did the job.  It has progressively gotten worse over the year.  I'm at the point now, where it doesn't even work.

I can't rotate or tilt the camera on my own, I can't even see video longer than a second before it freezes up and starts loading, and honestly, a second is being generous.  The loader rarely goes away and when it does go away, the connection is still crappy.

I felt I could justify the price because it was for safety. The fact that you check in on the baby from anywhere was important since my husband is away often. It seemed like a good way for him to still be connected while out of town. I also liked the thought of just using my ipad or iPhone for a monitor screen.<br /><br /> This ended up being a total waste of money. After complications with set up, we attempted to contact customer service, which was a complete joke. Discovering the problem on our own, we were up and running. The amount of delay time makes me nervous to rely on this. The delay is my biggest complaint. The app often crashes. And I have found that it makes more sense to have a monitor screen completely dedicated to the monitoring the baby- Not an ipad or iPhone, which is often being used for other tasks.<br /><br />The one thing I like about the monitor is its aesthetics. That's it. It's way too expensive for something pretty that doesn't work correctly. After spending so much money on this and still needing a working real-time monitor, I had an issue with shelling out for another expensive monitor.

I bought the first one a couple of years ago for our first child and now we have another child and need for another monitor. This monitor is really easy to use.  Not sure about the problems people are having, but it works great for OSX or for Windows.  For OSX you can use any device or you can use any web browser.  The included IPTool will look for your device on OSX and then launch the web browser with the ip address and port you set up.  It works great.  Also, since I have multiple monitors, I can switch easily between them on my iphones, ipads, or templates.  I can also access my monitors anywhere by using the DDNS address (on the bottom of the camera) using any browser, so you don't even need the software to give your relatives access.  One thing to keep in mind is that the access is not encrypted via [...]  When you use it in house, your encryption is done via your wireless settings...  The directions are a bit weird, but not hard if you have any technical ability.  Even so, a few tips:<br /><br />1. When you set your camera up, make your IP address static.  That way, your port and address are set.  DHCP takes time, and so does the registry for DDNS, so this might frustrate some people going from wired to wireless. Setting it to static will keep everything, well, static and you won't have to wait for the camera to setup and everything else to update.<br />2. You will need to reboot the device (unplug) when going from wired to wireless so that it resets the connection.  When it does not detect a wired connection, it will then go to wireless.<br />3. To switch back and forth between the two devices, hit the setup button on the IOS device to switch.  On any machine, just open a new tab in the browser with the correct ip settings...something like either [...] <<-replace here with valid information.<br /><br />It does not tell temperature or humidity.  It does:<br /><br />1. Monitor in darkness or light<br />2. Passthrough audio (you cannot speak into it - no two way comm)<br />3. Movement alerts<br />4. Connections to passthrough audio<br />5. Connections to home alarm system<br />6. dynamic DNS service to access anywhere if your router supports uPnP<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Setup<br />2. Access anywhere with any platform<br />3. Multiple monitors are easily managed<br />4. Flexible config<br />5. Audio monitoring<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Requires some technical knowledge<br />2. No temperature gauge (maybe???)<br />3. No two way audio native but through 1/8\\"" jacks in the back<br />4. No music passthrough<br /><br />In any case, it works terrific.  As I mentioned, I have two of these and it's really convenient.  I have had the Sony and the Phillips and some others.  Temp guage is important, but I have a more accurate one in the infant room.  I've noticed the baby monitor temp gauges are usually off by anywhere from 3-11 degrees, so I didn't find it useful - just panic causing (omg the baby's room is 85 degrees!!! - nope, the monitor was just plain wrong...)...<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.",2013-05-08

You do need two hands to open it, but I can't imagine any travel wipes container that you wouldn't have to do that.  It's much easier than other travel containers I've used because you can easily pull out just one wipe, and there's no danger of all the wipes falling out all over the floor of a restroom when you're just trying to get one out, which has happened to me with other containers (hence my purchase of a second one of these!).  I use the strap to attach it to a hook on the inside of my diaper bag so it's easy to find when I need it... I wouldn't hang it on the outside -- no need.

If the phone wasn't configured correctly, or was in do not disturb mode it wouldn't make any noise at all.  Plus I always had to make sure it was on me and turned up so I could hear it.  I quickly decided that I was going to need a dedicated unit that would make noise as soon as the baby did.  I decided on the motorola unit below and couldn't be happier.  My favorite part about it is how sensitive it is to the baby making real noise but at the same time how the speaker will actually turn itself off when there's no or next to no noise in the room.

I had been looking for a smart-phone app based baby monitor with our daughter on the way this summer. After researching a few other similar monitors, this seemed to have the most features and relatively good reviews so we ordered it. Before diving into the review, I should note that I work with computers for a living. So I'm probably a bit more tech savvy than the average user.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I was very pleased with the look and construction of the unit. Very clean looking unit without many buttons or lights. Seems like it would fit into any nursery without standing out too much. Unit isn't too big, and folds up like a clam shell for easy storage.<br /><br />Setup wasn't too difficult. Found the app on the Android market very easily. Instructions were easy to follow, and I was ready to go after connecting to my phone via Bluetooth and connecting my Wifi network. Everything looked pretty good at this point.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Unfortunately the good feeling didn't stick around long. After I was up and running, I immediately noticed how poor the video frame rate and video quality were. I realized that this would be a huge issue once we were using it with our daughter because the lag almost made the monitor unusable. Without exaggerating, there was at least a 1-2 second lag between live movement and seeing movement on my phone. Just for reference, the camera, my phone, and my wifi router were all within 10 feet of each other during this trial. There was no difference in lag or quality with using Bluetooth or Wifi. I even tried resetting and re-connecting everything from the beginning, but ended up with the same result.<br /><br />I wanted to review the night-vision and other features, but the lag and quality were so bad that I honestly couldn't give a fair review.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointing with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor. Forthe money, I didn't expect a performance this poor. We ended up with a similar product by Motorola, and it has worked great on every test so far.",2013-05-28

We haven't used them yet with the natural bottles as the baby won't be here till July, but I tried one one with a bottle ring on a Philip Avent natural bottle and it honestly felt like it all came together with a snap and was extremely secure.  Don't think we will be getting any leaks!  I will probably test these out by putting some water in the bottle along with using the screw rings and sealing discs to see if it leaks.    Update (February 2016): I'm on baby #2 now and using these again with the classic screw rings and natural bottles. I have never haf one leak the entire time I used it for baby #1 and now baby #2.

We needed two jumpers so I just bought both for variety but if I had to only buy 1 jumper, it would definitely be the Fisher Price. My baby LOVES the Rainforest Jumperoo. He laughs, squeals and jumps like crazy in it. He loves all the spinning thingies, the alligator and the sun.  He loves the elephant, monkey and the parrot in the front.  The parrot is definitely the favorite!  Hasn't figured out how to pop out the tiger yet.  Loves grabbing the blue frog.  He plays with each and every thing as he rotates around.  He is just so happy in this thing.<br /><br />In case you are debating which one of the 2 to get...... The Baby Einstein is definitely not as jumpy and the seat is not as snugly so I have to stuff some blankets in his back. I believe this affects the jumpiness of the jumper, the huge gap in the seat. So the Baby Einstein is basically like an exersaucer but it is better than a [[ASIN:B007IV17PQ Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center]], for instance, because you can switch out the toys. The Baby Einstein has those 2 arches and 6 loops. You can also attach even more toys with those plastic links such as [[ASIN:B008IT76AW Infantino Ring-A-Links Teether Set]]. I have switched out toys so many times as my baby grew. I didn't use the toys that it came with because they are not BPA free. I took off the sun and the cloud because he kept licking it. I didn't use any of the detachable little toys that it came with. I replaced everything with BPA free and organic toys. Obviously I left the piano and spinner but hey, you do what you can. Every little bit helps. So I would definitely recommend both. The Fisher Price as a jumper and the Baby Einstein as an exersaucer. I do put pillows underneath both because we have hardwood floors and I noticed that my baby's pinky toes would bleed when he jumped too hard.",2013-06-01

I'm 2 years strong in dealing with withings. After year one my original purchase died. They replaced it free of charge because I was one week short of the warranty expiring. That made me happy that they stood behind the product and assured me this isn't typical of their product.   1 year 1 month later the battery inside the unit exploded and the unit itself will no longer turn on. Because I am 1 month past the warranty now they are offering me a 25% discount to buy a new one. They said it's normal for their batteries to swell but not explode. I told them to keep the discount I'll buy another unit from a different brand at full price. I'm not risking a leaky battery on my baby or future babies. Their customer service is much to be desired. I'm done with WITHINGS.     Original review: Ok let me start off by saying that I really liked this monitor at first. I hate buyers remorse and would have talked myself out of most issues.  I have 2 HTC Thunderbolts (Android 4.0.4) with which I side loaded this app onto because it wasn't &#34;compatible&#34;. I also own the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 which I downloaded the app from the Amazon app store being that it was actually compatible.  With the FIRE HD 8.9 on wifi only I was able to use the microphone, check the temp/humidity, be alerted of too much noise or motion, play a lullaby and turn on the night light. I could also control the volume of the lullaby as well and change the song. The issue was that after about 4 hours or so the app would just turn off. If i was around for that event i could easily just click the app and it was back on again. However, in the middle of the night you dont realize the app turned off. Being unsure if this was a problem with the app, hardware of the monitor, or the Kindle Fire, i decided to try side loading the apps onto our smartphones and try with those.  With side loading the app onto our HTC thunderbolts that were supposably incompatible i was able todo everything i was able to do on the FIRE HD. Pleased with that I hoped that I would be able to have this on all night as well. Nope about four hours into it, it to would just turn off. Again not sure if it was the app, the smartphones, or the monitor itself and then possibly my wifi network connection. I decided to view the app remotely and see if i could rule out the network connection. Complete access even remotely was nice but it did seem again that after so many hours it would just randomly turn off.  I contacted customer support with all the information i provided above and asked for their help. They were awesome about trouble shooting and giving me suggestions. Suggestion 1: Turn the smartphone or tablet completely off resetting the ram memory and then try running the app all night. Result: Fail. Suggestion 2: Rule out the hardware issue of the Baby Monitor: Try with an apple product. If the Apple product is able to run all night then its an Android problem. If it fails as well it is either a network problem or the baby monitor itself.   I got ahold of an iTouch 4th generation(running on iOS 6). An iTouch is alot cheaper and easier to get (without contracts and such so I could return it easily as well). I ran the iTouch all night on the wifi network of my house and it worked flawlessly. Never turned off. And even when it had an interruption in the connection, it reconnected itself and didnt just turn the app off like the Androids i own did.  So customer service resolved the issue as far as what was the weak link. However, I was extremely displeased with the fact that they did nothing to help me with an Android problem with which was the issue. So I spent $250 on this monitor and another $180 on an iTouch with which all that money I could have bought a wireless security camera with all the bells and whistles for that money. I would have lost a few baby friendly features but over all the monitoring would have been the same.  Bottom line: If you own an apple product this will work for you flawlessly. If you own android only products like I did, contact people who have the same android model as you and software and see if they had an issue. I can tell you from my experience the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 and the HTC THUNDERBOLTS did NOT work flawlessly. If you insist on buying this product and still have android only products i suggest buying an iTouch if you are not planning on buying an iPad or iPhone anytime soon. The iTouch can do everything an iPhone can do with some limitations (like making a Tower call or using 3g/4g) but for wifi purposes it can do all the same things for the most part at a much cheaper price.",2013-06-04

It came down to the Withings versus a Foscam IP camera. We ended up deciding on the Withings monitor because it was essentially an IP camera built up to be a baby monitor. There were a lot of great features like the ability to play songs, the night light, and night vision. Plus it was compatible for both Apple and Android products (very important since we have both). If you watch the demo video on the Withings web page, the resolution is great during the day. Night vision also looks very clear. Can't go wrong with this purchase right?<br /><br />The camera arrives, and I go to download the app on my Android. The Google Play store tells me \\""device not compatible\\"". Okay, well let me try my tablet. It has a different version of the Android OS so it should work.. \\""device not compatible\\"". After scouring their website I did find a buried link to an Android app. It works on my tablet, but crashes on my phone. Things are not starting off well.<br /><br />We test out the video. I have the camera on in a decently lit room. My wife is on the couch maybe six feet away from the camera, and I can barely see her. The pinch to zoom works, but all I get is a garbled pixelated mess. There was also close to an 8-10 second lag. This was over Wi-Fi, and I know my network isn't congested. I plugged the camera into my gigabit LAN just to see if it was any better. It was not.<br /><br />I'm still really trying to find a reason to like this product. We turn off all the lights and test the night vision. You cannot see anything. Night vision does not work at all. The only things that did seem to work on the monitor were the lullaby's, and night light. But with a $250 price tag, I really need more out of my device.<br /><br />We returned the device and purchased a Foscam FI8910W IP camera. At less than $90, it does everything I need and more. Of course it does require a little bit more know howin setting up versus the Withings monitor, but it really is well worth it. Lag time is virtually unnoticeable. The clarity of the video is excellent. There are apps available for both Android and Apple. And the night vision is amazing. I can zoom in on a picture on my wall while it's pitch black and make out the lettering.<br /><br />In summary, I hope this helps someone out in the future. I went into this really hoping for an amazing product, and just could not be more let down. I saved a ton of money with another product, and it works.",2013-06-07

My son is almost 3, so I've had to carefully explain to him that he needs to be careful and not touch the camera because it is very expensive and easy to break.  I would be really nervous to use it around a younger baby or toddler as it's really easy to yank off.  I guess you could mount a shelf and then put the camera on the shelf.  However, one big drawback is that it needs to be opened to 90 degrees or the resolution is even poorer (I learned this on the Withings FAQ website).  It's very tricky to pull that off without using the angled bracket that attaches to the crib (that is easy to yank off).  I'm seriously considering returning it for these reasons.",2013-06-12

After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.,2013-06-12

When I got it I actually thought it was defective because, as others have mentioned, the elephant seems to be facing the wrong way and is *very* difficult even for me to turn. I also thought the bug/butterfly was broken because it just flops around but I guess that's what they intended.<br /><br />Baby girl eventually got tall enough to reach the floor on the 1 setting and started to get the hang of it, then really loved the bouncing. She initially went for the spinning parts of the toys b/c she was familiar with that activity from some other toys she has. Then she went for the floppy bug, which is apparently great for chewing on. It also took her a while to realize she could turn the seat, but now she's got that covered too.<br /><br />She only recently at 7 months started messing with the peek-a-boo tiger, but she just pulls on the tiger, she doesn't push the button. Although, as others comment, that button is pretty worthless for getting the tiger to really pop out.<br /><br />But it's the bouncing that she really enjoys and that's the part that's developing her muscles so I'm good with that. The only problem is that now she's at a height where she's between level 1 and 2. I wish there was a level 1.5. If I had a way to sew in another level on the straps I would b/c now on level 1 her knees are bent. She still bounces but I worry that she's really landing hard, but I guess now she's really working her legs b/c she's practically doing burpees with the squat/jumps she's doing. I tried switching to level 2 but she can barely touch her toes then. It's surprising what a difference the two levels are.  I'll try changing levels again in a couple weeks.<br /><br />I like that there are at least the two sound levels, the music gets annoying *really* fast. So I also like the setting that doesn't make constant noise - if she's not bouncing a lot the sounds don't come on as much.<br /><br />This thing is a pretty good space hog. It takes up a LOT of room in a small NYC apartment but I managed to rearrange some things so we can leave it up instead of trying to \\""fold\\"" it away. Even in the folded position it takes up a lot of room, but it at least helps a little if you do need to store it away, I just got tired of dealing with opening and closing it. The one complaint I had about having to open and fold it was that the little button you push to release the sections is pretty hard to push in. Maybe it's the angle I was working at but it was a pain (sometimes also literally) to release the sections so I could lap them.<br /><br />But for the couple issues with the toys and the significant height differences in the levels I would give this a 5. If baby girl only sort of liked it I would give it 3 stars, but she *loves* this thing - she's at the age where she is dying to move around on her own and this seems to give her some feeling of being able to move (until she gets cranky then she seems to feel trapped...). I only wish she could sit in it for longer than she does so I could get more done.<br /><br />(Update: now at almost 9 months she's not quite as interested in this, in fact, she cries when we try to put her in it. She's moved on to crawling all over so she's not fond of anything that confines her. So, like so many baby items, this was great for a short period of time.)",2013-06-24

I have found most owners are overly eager to review prior to experiencing some of the more notorious and well documented issues.<br /><br />This product seems really great at first but inevitably starts to show it's true colors.  If you expect this to stream audio all throughout the night, without interruption your're in for a disappointment.  Nine out of Ten times the connection is interrupted and your audio turns off leaving you unaware until your child starts crying loud enough to wake you.<br /><br />If and when you do have issues good luck getting them resolved in a timely manner.  Customer service is pretty terrible.  I believe this company is headquartered somewhere in France and the only way to communicate with them is via email.  That said, it takes an average of 5 days for them to respond and if they address your concern the first time around consider yourself lucky.<br /><br />As far a video baby monitor is concerned, it's great when it works and it works 85% of the time.  When it doesn't work it is extremely frustrating there is no timely fix.  This could mean you're without a monitor for days or even weeks which only amplifies the frustration.  It seems as though Withings was a little too ambitious with this product and released it prior to properly dev testing and resolving every last bug.<br /><br />Overall, if I had a choice to purchase again I would probably go in a different direction.  It is important to realize there are other comparably priced wireless networking cameras which are not specifically marketed to the baby demographic.  Said wireless network cameras primary function is to stream audio/video reliably and as a bonus, can also be repurposed when the children are older.  They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile.They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile.",2013-06-26

She was 7 months old at the time.  She enjoyed the seat and used it occasionally but it was never really her favorite.  She was just beginning to crawl and was more interested in moving around on the floor.<br /><br />Now with my second daughter we were able to get this seat out for her when she was first big enough to fit into it, which was around 3 months old.  She has absolutely loved it from the first time we put her in it.  Sometimes she'll jump as hard as she can, while others she'll just pull at some of the toys while resting in the seat.  It is the first thing I'll put her in when I have to get something done.<br /><br />I've decided I think the big difference between my two girls is the ages in which they started using the product.  My first daughter was old enough that jumping wasn't as exciting for her anymore.  She had other ways of moving around and it just didn't keep her attention enough.  Therefore I think this is probably best up until your baby really starts to crawl around and be more mobile.  My daughter is 6 months old now and not quite crawling yet so she is still really enjoying it.  It is a product that has a fairly limited time span for a child, but I think it is worth it for how much fun they have with it.<br /><br />The product has held up really well after being taken apart and put back together between children.  The quality is great and it still looks like new.  I'm sure I will be able to use it again if I have more children in the future, which helps to make it worth the somewhat steep price.",2013-06-29

Works well with wifi and 4G mobile data service.,"We like it. We connected all of our mobile devices and tablets to this device.  It's easy to set-up, password protected, and provides traditional features of a baby monitor even if you're not watching the video.  For example, if your baby makes noise in the night, your mobile phone or tablet will resonate this sound for you even if the display is turned-off.  The monitor has infrared or low-light video capability that works fine.  You can also talk to your baby, if you connect your own speakers.  The field of view is also adjustable by remote with the slide of your finger.  Works good from my office's wifi network, and from the 4G service from the sidewalk.  I've only connected Apple products to the device, not my computer nor any Android-based device; I'm not sure whether you can do that with this device. For an Apple-product-only device, it's awesome.<br /><br />My overall satisfaction is high as I've purchased other similar products and returned them.  Forcing myself to think of the negatives, it would be nice to have a built-in speaker for the talk-back feature, but this isn't a deal breaker for us.  Also, if you have a limited data plan on your mobile phone, your mobile phone may encounter additional data charges if you're not connected to your wifi network.<br /><br />I recommend this product.<br /><br />As an update, I found the settings to allow me to access this device by Android apps and by my desktop browser.",2013-06-30

I know a lot of reviews said that the leaves stopped working, but I have not run into that problem.The only real problem-and this may be because the other rainforest items that we have are play related- is that it doesn't put her to sleep. I was afraid of that when I bought this mobile, but I was pretty desperate, so I gave it a shot anyways. Once I turn it on, DD becomes wide awake and starts kicking her legs... she'll do many things except go back to sleep! So, needless to say it has become nothing more than a crib accessory: Something that is not, under any circumstances turned on, but nice for her to look at when she wakes up :).

Our experience was:<br />Incomplete directions in box<br />Incomplete directions on site<br />No phone number given at all.  Anywhere<br />Only way to reach customer service is via email<br />Actually, email was sent before first attempt to set up with questions that were not covered in manual or online. It took 2 weeks for a reply.  And the late reply was incomplete.<br /><br />After 48 hours of utter frustration, trying everything possible I set up an appt with the Genius Bar at my local Apple store. The guys there were happy to help and eager to see this product working. 2 of them were there to help me and were not able to get this started. Grrrr<br />With the geniuses help, we wrote a note to withings customer service with specific product details and issues standing in the way of successful set up. The note was sent on July 1st. Today is July 12 and still no reply. This is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />I had no other choice than to return this to amazon. I wanted this product to work so I asked for a replacement. Amazon got a new one to be in 2 days. I was able to set the new one up on my own.<br /><br />So how is the product working?  Overall I like it. The camera is pretty good. The app works well on both of our iPhone and iPads. I love the fact that there is no separate unit to carry around. And it works just as well on wifi as it does on a g3 network out and about.<br /><br />I have MAJOR concerns about security.

I was reluctant because of the price but also excited because it has a lot of features and is sold in Apple stores (so it has to be good, right?).<br /><br />First impressions - packaging is very nice, like an Apple product. Unit construction is more solid than I expected. Hinge has nice resistance to it and the unit is hefty, as expensive electronics should feel.<br /><br />Setup - Stick in battery, plug in, powered on, connected to my home network, linked to it via Bluetooth with my iPad3, no problem. Very simple.<br /><br />Desktop/browser viewer - Sorry, THERE ISN'T ONE!! After video quality this was probably my second highest 'want' in an IP cam/baby monitor. I saw posts online asking Withings for a desktop/browser app over a YEAR ago; they say it's \\""in the works\\"" but they still don't have one! For $230+ you better have a desktop/browser viewer. Just ridiculous.<br /><br />Video Quality - In a word: bad. Over my very fast n-channel wireless home network I was literally getting 1fps. One. Frame. Per. Second. Trust me, I timed it. And the picture was hardly \\""HD\\"". It was blocky and horridly rendered, looked like 256 color mode or something. I tested the monitor out in the same room as the router, and in various other rooms with no improvement.<br /><br />No worries, I'll try hard-wiring it with an Ethernet cable. Connected the cable, reconfigured the baby monitor to use Ethernet only. Video quality: still crap. Okaaaay. I closed the unit, removed the battery to force power cycle. Powered it back up: a little better. Picture was slightly clearer and was running at ~5-10fps, slightly better, but hardly smooth. Also, there is a full 2-3 second delay between real time and what the monitor registers. Eh, annoying, but I can live with the delay. However, the FPS is just atrocious! I even Googled example footage online to see if I just had a bad unit or not - the videos I found were a little better than what I was getting but not impressive (which I expected after dropping $230+ on a baby monitor!!). I messed with router settings, QoS, port forwarding, all with no improvement.<br /><br />I also tested the IR night vision in a pitch-black room and the video was exactly what you'll find online: very washed-out as if the subject was in a spotlight. Other cams (like the Foscams) provide a much less intense IR illumination and light up more of the subject with a softer, more uniform light instead of a spotlight.<br /><br />A bit of background info: I am a computer engineer by trade and also buy and review a fair amount of tech and gadgets on the side. Also, my home wifi network is running off a Netgear R6300 and with Comcast I typically get 30-60Mbps down/5-8Mbps upload, so I don't think my setup is the problem.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- good construction<br />- easy, simple setup<br />- lots of features: two-way mic, colored LEDs, plays music, humidity/temp sensor, movement and audio alerts<br /><br />Cons:<br />- video picture quality and FPS is VERY POOR, both over wireless and Ethernet<br />- NO DESKTOP APP/BROWSER VIEWER - cannot stress this one enough. I do not expect to solely check on my baby with an iOS device when I'm at home because of the battery drain, and because when I'm working I'll be on a desktop or my wife on a laptop. Withings has no excuse for not having a desktop app/browser viewer for this product, especially at the premium you pay for it (I mean, come on, I paid ~$200 for a solid wood crib on Amazon! The price is just absurd...).<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Returning it and buying a Foscam FI8921. It is half the price, has pan/tilt option, better FPS, better video quality, better IR night vision, and has a browser viewer. I'm expecting setup with the 8921 will be a bit more intensive, but I will gladly spend more time getting it up and running than having to deal with the Withings baby monitor.<br /><br />There is aguy on youtube, channel name is \\""awkward hamster\\"" that reviews and uses a number of Foscams with his Apple products and the FI8921 looks like a MUCH better, cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I will update this review when I receive and test out the FI8921. Wish me luck!<br /><br />***EDIT (7/16/13)***<br />Received Foscam FI8921 last night and tested it out: VERY impressed.<br /><br />Setup: popped in CD and loaded Mac software, connected 8921 to Ethernet and had fullscreen HD video on my Mac in about sixty seconds. Awesome.<br /><br />Video Quality: Excellent! Video is amazingly crisp and definitely 720 quality. Video gets a bit blurry when panning/tilting but instantly regains focus when cam is not moving. Latency is very good - no more than 1/4 to 1/2 second delay from real time to feed displayed on screen. I am extremely pleased!<br /><br />Web UI: the browser interface (which I am testing in Safari on Mac OS 10.8.something) is very intuitive, organized, fast and packed with features. You can do everything from change the cam network settings, control pan/tilt, activate two way mic, IR lights, reboot camera, etc.<br /><br />iPhone/iPad App: I have not had a chance to connect to the cam via iOS app yet so stay tuned.<br /><br />Wireless Setup: My cam shipped with Firmware version 1.1.1.10. After following the PDF guide and trying multiple times I could not get the cam to connect to my wireless network. I quickly found the Foscam support forums, downloaded the new firmware for the FI8921 (version 1.1.1.13) and (after two tries) got the cam firmware upgraded and rebooted. Tried to connect to wireless again: BOOM. Worked first time. Video quality/fps is exactly the same as when connected via Ethernet.

During the day, the quality of the video is great, and the sound quality is better than any other baby monitor I've seen or heard.  I also liked that it comes with a built in temperature and humidity sensor, which is a smart idea, and more baby monitors should incorporate this.<br /><br />Things I hated about this product:<br /><br />1. On the first night of using it, I accidentally left my wifi turned off on my iPhone.  I left the app open and running, and I ended up streaming 16 GB of data over the course the night.  16 GIGABYTES.  Luckily I have an unlimited data plan, if my wife had made the same mistake, it would have cost her somewhere on the order of $15,000 in overage charges based on her data plan.<br /><br />2. The night vision is horrible.  I can barely make my daughter out, and for several hours, couldn't tell her head from her stuffed bunny.  It's surprising how terrible the night vision is, considering this is a high end product.<br /><br />3. This device CONSTANTLY spams you with notifications and alerts.  Mostly, \\""Monitoring of your baby has ended.\\"", followed in two minutes by \\""You can now monitor your baby.\\""  (Apparently, whenever it loses the wifi signal for a second, you need to know right away, and end up getting two alerts.)  When I wake up in the morning, I'll usually have between 8 and 12 alerts, so I have to mute my phone if I want to sleep, which defeats the purpose of a baby monitor.  Note, this is after I disabled all of the alerts I could - you can configure alerts for sound in the room, movement in the room, temperature and humidity.  I turned all of these off because otherwise you get 20 alerts an hour, and even with those off, I get alerts all the damn time.  If my wife accidentally leaves the monitor on after my daughter's nap, I get spammed with dozens of alerts in the afternoons at work.  This is extremely annoying.<br /><br />4. There is a small status bar at the bottom of the screen that you can't move or get rid of.  Unfortunately, the way our room is set up, there is no way for us to position the camera so this bar is not at least partially obscuring our daughter when she sleeps.<br /><br />5. The video is very choppy most of the time, and usually more like a series of photos every few seconds.  Also, there is a noticeable delay, often as much as five seconds between what is happening on the camera and what is actually happening in the room.<br /><br />In general, this product feels half baked, and like it was released in a beta version.  It wouldn't take much for this to turn into a great product, but it's definitely not there yet.  I hated this baby monitor, and returned it to the store after around 10 days.",2013-07-28

We bought this for our 3 month old daughter because she was no longer satisfied laying and playing with the toys on the activity gym; she wanted to be able to sit up. She is very active and needed something more stimulating now that she has mastered rolling over in both directions.<br /><br />We have had this for about 2 weeks and she has really enjoyed it. The only drawback is that it is made for a taller child. She is 24&#34; and her feet dangle about 2 inches off the ground even on the lowest height setting. We solved the problem by sliding a small box under her feet and now she can bounce herself while she plays. She has tons of fun and can usually play for 20-30 minutes at a time without getting bored. However, she is not yet able to turn herself to get to any of the other toys. Maybe when her feet can actually touch the floor.<br /><br />Like other reviews have mentioned, the butterfly toy is basically just a limp noodle. She can't even play with it because it dangles over the far side of the toy ring and she can't reach it. I am planning on calling Fisher Price to see if they will send a replacement. Also, the reason we picked this particular theme over others were the reviews that talked about how wonderful and stimulating all the toys were. She loves the toy in the front that makes music, even though it drives my husband crazy. But this is the only toy she will play with for a long period of time, the others just don't seem to hold her interest.<br /><br />Update 7/2/15: This is maybe one of the best baby items that I have ever spent money on. My 2nd child is 6 months old and she has been using it for the last 3 months and loves it. She is very fussy and and was colicy until she hit 6 months and this was the only way we could keep her from crying for hours on end. It has made it through almost a year's worth of use between my 2 kids and lookslike it is virtually brand new. I even bought a 2nd one to keep at my in-laws so that my daughter has something familiar when she stays with them. She is just now learning to bounce herself but she figured out how to turn herself and play with the toys right away. She is 27&#34; tall at 6 months and can easily touch the floor on the 2nd height setting. If anyone is debating between this and the evenflo jumper system, I would buy this one a million times over.",2013-07-28

As they get older, they can hold onto them without them falling all over the place and getting dirty, and won't have to wake you up in the middle of the night if they misplace it, my babies always seemed to find it because of the stuffed animal at the end that is easy to grab.

If you are having any doubts about buying a Jumperoo, take the plunge...you will be so glad that you did! I am not one of those parents that buys everything under the sun for my babies, so it was hard for me to shell out the cash for a toy that we would use for less than 6 months. Several parents recommended this to me because our little guy loves to stand, and although I wish I could, I cannot hold him all day long. He loves it, I love it, it's a winner at our house!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The toys are attached so no playing pick up all day long<br />-It makes fun sounds<br />-Three adjustable heights<br />-There are toys to look at above baby so they have plenty of visual options. The toys also adjust to accommodate for different heights<br />-The chair very smoothly swivels! Awesome, so baby can turn him/herself around to play with new toys<br />-Bright colors for visual stimulation<br />-I wouldn't call it portable, but it semi-folds up if it needs to take up less room or be moved to another location<br />-Easy assembly (It does come in several pieces, assembly is required)<br />-It stands in a neat circle, doesn't have legs at awkward angles to trip over like similar products. It takes up a full corner in our living room (32&#34; in diameter & 32&#34; tall)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-My baby boy loves it so much that sometimes I forget that he has been in there too long :) Whoops!

Knowing i was the most tech swavy of the family, she consulted me to find somthing hi-tech. Ive been peeping this particular device before she went into labor, primarily for it's unique wifi feature, that allows one to view , talk, and play music to their baby (or caregiver), regardless of where the parent or viewer is. The baby came sooner then expected, so my sister decided to buy it on her own. Here's the things he likes, and dislikes about it:<br /><br />Likes:<br />-The fact that she can see, talk, and play music (and lights) to her child, regardless if she's at work ( School teacher) or at the supermarket over a 3G, 4G, or WIFI connection.<br />- You can connect it to any wireless network, which means when she brings her over to my house, my mother can set the device next to her. Sometimes they have conversations through the damn box!<br />-Multiple users can view the video feed, but only two at a time. Her husband, and my mother can view the child through their iPhones and iPads.<br />-Included battery, which lasts two hours. Micro usb cable included.<br />-Installation is a breeze<br /><br />Dislikes (At the time of the writing)<br />- Well, only two people can view the video feed at once.<br />- The video delay ranges from 5 seconds to 11 seconds, regardless to whichever connection youre on, you could be upstairs in the bedroom in my house uising the fastest affordable  internet (I have a NETGEAR Wireless A/C router i bought in January, on a Comcast/Xfinity 50mbps internet connection)an youll still have a delay. This is bad when you wanna talk to whomever's watching your baby through the  two-way speaker. Frame rate could be better<br />- Taking it out the packaging (you understand me once you open the retail packging) is harder than breaking the included Micro USB cable. that micro USB port it so easy to break. Use a micro USB from a smartphone instead, and plug it into the wall. '<br />- Included battery ONLY lasts two hours.<br />-Instlation is a breeze, ntill you get the app! it gets GLITCHY! but with a bit of paitence, it will be done, and the monitor will work.<br /><br />So if you have MONEY, and you want the BEST possible way to observe your child, sibling, niece, nephew, godchild, foster child, etc. I suggest you invest in this monitor!o the wall.

I use two stainless steel vacuum insulated beverage holders.  The buddy keeps them in a convenient location, stretches to easily and securely hold them and fits below the handles.  The buddy also has a large compartment that makes for easy access to small accessories that I want to get to quickly.

I'm usually against buying unnecessary gizmos and gadgets invented to make life easier than it already is, but this one has proved to really help in a lot of areas!<br /><br />Convenience:<br />My son would always spit out (on accident) and lose his paci mid-sleep, so we find ourselves getting up many times a night just to put it back in his mouth. This acts a \\""paperweight,\\"" so when he spits it out, it still sits right at his lips, just incase he decides he wants it again. Over time, as he starts to gain more control over his hands, he's learned to grab the monkey, itself, and bring it closer to his mouth. He has also learned to recognize the feeling of his \\""monkey.\\"" If I place any other stuffed toy near him, he'll ignore it until he finds his monkey, lol.<br /><br />Efficiency:<br />Oh, and this is GREAT for never losing anymore pacifiers! We've lost 2 before we decided to buy this! Once we got this, we've never even come close to losing it since it's practically a toy!<br /><br />Avent SOOTHIE attached:<br />There IS one caveat -- don't buy this unless your baby ALREADY LIKES \\""Soothies\\"" (which is the type of pacifier that's attached to the stuffed toy). If your baby is already used to orthodontic pacis, he/she may not like switching over to this type of pacifier.<br /><br />This VS. clip-ons:<br />I like this more bc it also acts like a toy, and it helps their fine motor skills when they learn to grab and grip onto things. A clip-on may also get in the way when you're trying to pick them up or hold them. The toy also helps to avoid letting the nipple part touch surfaces.<br /><br />ONLY CON:<br />The pacifier is permanently attached, but this is only a minor issue to me. When washing the paci, I don't mind getting the toy a little wet. It dries pretty quickly. And I try to clean it as soon as it gets dirty from milk or anything else. I also wipe it down occasionally.",2013-08-14

Baby has taken to making noises throughout the night, but doesn't really wake up. This way we can check in on him to see if he is awake or just making noise.<br /><br />The decision point was that we could use our phones to watch the kid in his crib, rather than having yet another screen to look at or plug in.  This probably means that we are going to stay and iPhone family for a few more years. Set up was insanely easy, once I read that you need to actually plug it into the router before it would register on WiFi.  From there, it's no harder than setting up a wireless printer.<br /><br />It does take a few seconds (up to 30) to load the app and get a video feed, the quality is decent.  I like the infrared so we can see him at night.  Though it feels like we are watching a bad episode of Ghost Hunters or Paranormal Activity.

The connection drops all the time, it is impossible to view the feed for more than 5 seconds.  The video quality is terrible and insanely choppy.  The 'alerts' are useless because the thresholds are inconsistent.  And what happens if you're out of town for a couple days and the thing decides not to recognize your wifi network any longer?  Get ready for non-stop alerts about \\""not able to monitor your baby any longer\\"" until you can get home and unplug the thing.

US,41252934,RVFXYFSWQCE4J,B000JIJPZY,235488510,Fisher-Price Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Baby,2.0,9.0,10.0,N,N,Too Small,"We own three of these types of mats, listed here in order from my favorite to least favorite.  Tiny Love Gymini Move & Play, Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym, and Fisher-Price Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym.<br /><br />Here's my comparison:  The first two, made by Tiny Love and Baby Einstein are very similar.  They both come with lots of toys to dangle, and you can also add your own.  They have lights and music which my son LOVES, and there is space to place other toys around my son for him to grab.  Both can fold flat in half easily without taking them apart and can store in between my couch and coffee table, so they are easily and quickly put away and taken out when needed.  Both are easy to wash, I just take off the arches and wash the mat part.  This is important if your baby spits up a lot like mine :)  I do not put them in the drier.  Here are the differences:  I like the Tiny Love mat better because it is much larger, so when my little guy starts to squirm around more, he will have more space to play.  Also when I lay next to him and talk to him, he can see me better with the Tiny Love mat (on the baby einstein mat, the toys are lower and closer together so they are always blocking him from seeing me).  Also, the Tiny Love mat is adjustable so that you can move the intersection of the two arches down so that your baby can look at the lights and music even during tummy time.  Since my son is not particularly fond of tummy time, this helps a lot.  The Tiny Love mat also has sides that fold up, which I haven't used yet but I'm thinking these might be useful when he starts playing with toys that can roll away but before he starts crawling.  The Baby Einstein mat comes with a little whale that you can prop baby up with for tummy time.  This doesn't work well for us because is is asymmetrical and he always ends of sliding to one side and becomes uncomfortable, so we don't use the whale.<br /><br />The third mat, made by Fisher Price, I really do not care for at all.  Is it so small that there is no space for me to place any toys around my son, nor can he move more that a few inches without being at the edge of the mat.  The arch dangles too low so toys suspended from it are nearly touching is face, although the arch is not directly over his face anyways so he doesn't even really care about those toys.  Although it's small, I would have to disassemble it in order to make it flat, which is not difficult but with a baby, I have better things to do, so it actually takes up more space to store than the other two I reviewed.  There are no lights and minimal music.  Disassembly to wash it is difficult since I have to take off the plastic sides.  The only thing my son likes about this mat is the mirror, which he looks at during tummy time.  (both other mats also have mirrors though)  Pretty  much, by son is better off just laying on a blanket.",2013-09-06

His suck reflex is consistent with what he does on the breast so he pushes out some and doesn't just suck, resulting in a pacifier that would fall out every two seconds.  Our solution was to fold a burp cloth into a strip and then tuck the cloth around his chin/shoulders and the pacifier, holding the pacifier in place.  He could always push the paci out when he wanted to and it never covered his face tightly.  However, this was a pain in the butt and I was always a bit worried about the cloth covering the face too tightly (SIDS paranoia, anyone?).<br /><br />We got the Wubbanub today.  It was smaller than I expected (I was thinking beanie baby size) so I didn't think it would work too well.  I was also thinking it would be easier for him to grab when older, but he doesn't grab much right now so I wasn't holding my breath.  I thought he'd still just push it right out.  Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />We tried it for nap time, and....AMAZING! It didn't fall out at all.

It gives us peace of mind when we're away from the baby. It's compact, look good when click onto the railing of the crib, and easy to travel with. The best feature for me is the \\""walkie talkie\\"" feature that allows you to talk/sing to the baby when you're not around. For my husband, he likes that he gets to watch the baby when he has a break at work, so he won't miss her too much.<br /><br />I also like the light feature that provides some sorts of hypnotizing effect when my baby is fussy.<br /><br />One thing I'm not really extremely happy with is the limited choices of the lullabies. However, my husband and I enjoy the soothing \\""ocean\\"" sound on it. Sometimes my husband fell asleep faster than the baby with the ocean waves...<br /><br />Overall, I love this product.

The animals turn and the leaves wave up and down.  Even when she is being held anywhere near it, she will stare at it waiting for it to move.  I was apprehensive when I ordered this mobile due to some of the reviews I read about it not working for very long or not fitting on the crib.  As for the problem of not working for very long, we have had this mobile for over a month now and it is still going strong.  It is unfortunate that some people have had trouble with it in that aspect because it really is a beautiful and entertaining product for baby.  And in terms of it not fitting on the crib, I just have to say that right on the box it says that it won't fit all cribs (specifically convertible cribs).  I think maybe that is just a matter of people not paying attention to the product features or doing their research.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that the plastic screw contraption that holds it onto the crib could possibly be a little sturdier.  I am confident that it is not going to break or come loose and fall on baby, but I think if they were going to focus on improving any part of the mobile, that would be it.<br /><br />Oh, and also:  the rainforest noises are great.  The classical music options:  not so great for anyone who is actually a fan of the beautiful sounds of classical.

Our baby girl just loved it from the start! She began using it when she was just 3,5 month old and couldn't even sit up on her own yet, so we put a little blanket behind her back so she could feet snug). As her feet couldn't reach the floor yet we put a few big books on the floor underneath. All this worked out just great!! Now that she is 6 month old she doesn't need blanket or books any more. She really loves her jumper and is fascinated by it's vibrant and cheery colors and toys!<br /><br />For our second home we purchased Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper (just wanted to try another jumper for a change). It was a little disappointing to us. Our girl still can not sit in it comfortably even at 6 months. The seat is very wide and shallow and there is nothing I can do to make my baby comfortable. Also the holes for legs are positioned very weird - they are located more toward the front of the seat rather than the middle and it makes my baby tilt forward way too much. She loves the toys on this jumper, but I can tell that she can't reach them very well because of the seat position. She can stay in the jumper for a maximum of 5 minutes and then wants to get out.<br /><br />She can stay in the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for at least 20 min and always has a blast!

I just became a great grandmother.  I, from the reviews, decided to send this item.  Unfortunately it was sold out.  The web site advised me to ORDER NOW and they would ship it when available.  So I put it into my cart noticing that the item had jumped from $85 to $99.99. In looking at it I noticed that is was from a different company and was available. I didn't want to pay the extra cost. I took the time to speak to an Amazon representative and she advised me that you cannot hold an item.  What confused me was Amazon told me to order ASAP and it would be sent when it came in.  This was totally incorrect.<br /><br />I am saddened that Amazon is becoming  sloppy on their web site.  They couldn't tell me when the item would come in.  Obviously Amazon wants me to buy the more expensive one.  Yup I am angry but I wanted to share this with other customers that purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />In addition while I have your attention I have learned that Amazon now charges a re-stocking FEE in addition to the return postage.  I sent two items back.  One was defective and one because I didn't like.  I expected to pay the postage for the one I didn't like.  I got hit with a re-stocking fee for the defective and other item.  So anyone reading this, be very careful in your returns. Call them first to get them to tell you what will happen, the return charges and then have them follow up with an email to confirm what they said.<br /><br />I never did get the product and had to order a different type. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years.  These last few months have been very discouraging as I feel Amazon isn't taking care of customers as they used to.",2013-10-19

Emailed the Withings customer support and except for an email asking how my support experience was, I never heard back from anyone.<br /><br />After about a week of troubleshooting decided it wasn't me or my network and returned it. Amazon was great - one click return and since I had originally used the overnight option, the return was the same - received it the next day. Without so much as a question about the one I was returning. Sweet. Boxed up the old one, used their return UPS label and off it went.<br /><br />New one finally worked as advertised. Connected via bluetooth, ran the setup, attached it to the WIFI and that was it. We were off.<br /><br />Worked great for the last 4 months.<br /><br />Now the USB Power port broke - detached from the motherboard without even touching it. Like the glue just broke.<br /><br />Since the last Withings support experience was non existent, I called Amazon to see if the HW Warranty could be done through them. They said no, it cant - but we will send you a replacement anyways. Do you want the old one back? Nope, just call the manufacturer and see if they want it but otherwise, have a nice day. Now that's customer service.<br /><br />So my review says Its ok, which is about all I can muster. Good idea, bad support, kind of weak manufacturing quality, but when it works, it does everything I need it to: IOS access, local and over the internet with good pic and sound quality.<br /><br />Amazon on the other hand has been great all the way through.<br /><br />NOTE: 10/28 - Received replacement in the mail today. Plugged it and connected via bluetooth, and noticed immediately that the lens is out of focus. Looks like the auto-focus isn't working. Its focused if your about two inches from the lens, but thats it. Also, the color is all washed out - everything is pink like there is something over the lense (there isn't) and totally burned/washed out in the contrast'y hot places (like where a bright light is).<br /><br />So it powers up and connects to wifi, but no focus and tinted.

Got several Facebook pics to prove it ;)<br />The bouncer is solidly built with materials of high quality, stitching on cloth is tight and really soft so you don't have to worry about your child being uncomfortable.<br />Our son has used this bouncer for over 3 months and its still in great condition, he loves the toy variation and the seat swivels so smoothly he has no issue turning to play with the next toy.<br />The bouncer also has a battery powered music and animal sound player which you will need a screwdriver for and 3 AA batteries. Its well worth it though as the animal sounds are triggered by moving one of the toys and it keeps our son constantly laughing.<br />All in all this is a great toy made of high quality materials and with a lot of thought put into installing toys with features and colors that a young boy would love and not get easily bored of.<br />btw if you like this toy also try the jungle gym of this same brand (Has a giraffe in one of the corners). They are both well worth the price.",2013-10-31

When I received them, I was impressed that they not only easily fit both of my nephews' wrists (who are 2 and 3 months old), but they even fit my own! Of course, they just barely fit. There was some Velcro left over, which was slightly scratchy, so if for some reason a little was showing for the baby, I would have to keep that into consideration.<br /><br />The rattling, on the other hand, was not what I expected. One of them rattled, but it was considerably quiet. The other did not even rattle! It was the type of toy you squish and it makes crunching noises, which was actually probably more entertaining than the rattle. The babies did not seem to notice them yet, but they may be too young for that still.<br /><br />One other note, I remember reading a review that said their older child seemed more entertained by it than their baby. Boy was that the case in this scenario! My two year old nephew wanted to have them for himself! We had to bargain with him to let the baby have them.

For one thing (the main thing for me), the night vision is TERRIBLE. I have the camera about 7 feet away from the crib, and while other monitors I've owned have not had a super clear nighttime picture at this range, with this camera I couldn't even tell there was a baby in the crib! One of the neat features of this device is that it tracks and can alert you to movement in the room; however, since you can't see the baby, this doesn't work either at night/in the dark. Since the only times I'm monitoring my daughter is when it's completely dark in the room, this was a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The other major issue is that it only ever stayed connected for 5-10 minutes. Then it would tell me that I'd lost connection and an attempt to reconnect failed. Sometimes I could go into the app and manually reconnect, but too often it wouldn't even let me. I can hear my daughter naturally from her room if she cries at night, so that's why this wasn't my main issue. If you are relying on this monitor to hear what's going on in your baby's room, that is a huge problem (I used this monitor for 5 nights and it never once stayed connected.).<br /><br />I also realized that I actually didn't like my monitor being on my phone. I like to make calls, answer emails, and do other things on my phone when my daughter is napping, and I didn't like having to sacrifice being able to see her. You can keep the app running in the background, but then it's only sound (so does no good if you are making a phone call), and whenever I did that it disconnected even quicker.  I have since purchased the Infant Optics DXR-8 and am loving it!",2013-12-10

Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!!

My husband and I wanted a monitor that didn't require a bunch of other hand-helds to carry around with us as we always have our smart phones or tablets handy. We figured that a lot of the issues were with less than tech-savvy individuals, and because we are pretty competent, we could make it work.  There were several problems with the monitor, making it unusable for us, and believe me, we tried.  First of all, the night vision on the monitor is grainy at best.  There is a significant lag in the video feed, even when plugged in via ethernet cable, and not relying on wifi, which incidentally made the feed even slower.  But the real difficulty is with the app.  It is very unstable for the android platform, and I have a brand new top-of-the-line android smart phone and tablets running the newest version of kitkat, so this shouldn't be a problem.  The app frequently freezes and disconnects, making monitoring the baby virtually impossible.  I also was never able to successfully set my monitor alert levels, because every attempt made the app crash.  Oh, and let's not forget the FAQ/tech support section of the Withings website which is a joke.  Attempts to contact the developers were met with unanswered emails. Ultimately, this is a great idea but it is just not there yet.  I have heard that iPhone users have less issues, as the iPhone app seems to be updated more frequently. Get it together, Withings!

I'm a bit shocked reading other reviews also, is my 4/5 month old the ONLY one that is super board and not finding this toy amusing whatsoever? The first time I plopped her in she was around 3 months, the good thing is it has a high back so it supported her nicely. The sad thing is, the toys are all kind of unreachable (she can barely touch the floor in this, however I did give her a little boost with a book to see if it would help) but the toys just plain stink. The elephant doesn't even face her, and to turn it requires more force than she has (it's hard for me). The music is annoying and there is basically 1 tune it plays. There is a little tiger that is supposed to &#34;pop&#34; up when you push the button, well he barely moves out...slightly does the tip of his head raise up. I want to know who designed this and if they still have a job, it's pathetic and obviously designed by someone who doesn't have a child. The only thing my baby liked was to look at the lion and she laughed a couple times but was over it pretty fast. There are a few wheel type things to spin, one just has colors on it, and the baby can't reach and she doesn't even care to look at it when I spin it. The butterfly attachment is shown in the picture standing straight up and it is not like that at all- it's this limp thing that unless she's holding it just lays on the bottom. Blah, waste of money, I try to get her to sit in it, but she just slumps there looking miserable and I take her out after maybe 10 minutes. I hardly believe this many people rated it so highly...makes me wonder how true these reviews are.",2013-12-19

Maybe the problem was that she was already 6 months old when we tried it, but she didn't like how it pulled out of her mouth and would get very frustrated.

Either way, it bought us some time throughout the day to keep him safely occupied while we got things done. Seat cover is washable. He played with every part of that jumperoo including the creatures dangling from above. Music isn't annoying for parents either (at least for us it wasn't) and there's 2 volume settings as well as a setting for constant music versus only when baby is actively moving.

Read this !","INTRODUCTION:<br /><br />This is a great product that our daughter absolutely love. Our relatives a different jumperoo and this one is way better. She first started using it at 4-5 months old and as she reaches different developmental mile stones, she starts noticing different things she can do with it and its like a new experience all over again. She has developed good strength in her legs and at 6.5 months she doesn't get excited about trying to crawl she just wants to be on her feet ! She is literally walking around as long as she is holding on to both of my hands or fingers (balance will take some time). I think this really gave her a great \\""jump start\\"", no pun intended, at her physical strength and ability to transition to her feet. Of coarse I am a man and I wasn't excited about buying it until my wife insisted that I get it and let our little one try it. My wife and I love it. Below I will describe the product and answer questions I imagine you would like to know.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY:<br />If your like me and your wondering what the heck your wife is gonna end up buying next which you will ultimately end up putting together, then your in luck. This wasn't too bad, the toys which come with this fit right into their spots, the ring which forms the base on the ground is easy to lock together into place. Careful attention to the instructions will need to be taken though. The one thing which I found the most difficult and I have to say the instructions were very poor about, is the way that the red cloth which forms the seat is attached, be careful not to put this on backwards. It took me probably 40 minutes to assemble, maybe a little more, mostly prolonged due to the confusion with the seat cloth. Maybe its just me but I imagine you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />HEIGHT:<br />So your probably wondering what height is appropriate and if this is the right size. If you look at the photo you will see that the base which the baby sits in hangs or suspends by 3 green straps. These straps are adjustable and have 3 main settings. What this means is that the straps have separate holes that can be used for changing the height. When our child was only 3 months old she was using level 1, because her toes were just barely touching the floor, and as we understood it thats how its supposed to work, you don't want their entire feet touching the floor or it won't stimulate their urge to press down and hop. It would be as if they were just standing. As she reached 5 months, she was taller and so we had to adjust to level 2 which she is still using now at 6 months and I imagine will last until 8 months by the looks of it. Then theres level three which we haven't had to use yet.<br /><br />TOYS:<br />The toys on this are interesting, and our daughter likes them. Some she didn't pay attention to until she developed a bit more, a mile stone thing i suppose. The toys as mentioned fit easily into place and their assembly is a no-brainer. The toys make noise, light up, and allow for alot of interaction and learning. The main toy which is toward the front has two switches used for turning it on and the mode, as well as the volume. One mode allows for the music and jungle sounds to come on only when she starts jumping. Our daughter figured this one out quickly and its great for stimulating her mind and body for learning. There are some other toys which she can reach for and spin with her hands. A leaf on each side above her have a toy suspending from above which are fun to reach for while she is jumping. My main disappointment  was the firefly like toy which in you will see in the photo appearing blue with black and white polka dots standing firmly upright held up by green stem. Well since we bought this, it was nothing more than a slumped over toy which leans toward the floor, and our daughter can't even see it. Im not sure how it appears to be standing straight up in the photos. Didn't come with batteries, but what I have put in there has lasted until now w/o any problems.<br /><br />SPACE OCCUPIED:<br />The diameter as per my measurement with measuring tape is approx. 33 inches. It will certainly take up some space however not a huge deal. I liken it to the space occupied by a desk chair. We keep it near a corner to use space a little better however not too close to a corner so that she can still interact and see her surroundings. If you block their vision by putting it somewhere isolated, believe me they will get so bored very quickly. The base of this has a folding feature which supposedly allows you to collapse it in such away that it can be stored however we have not used it yet as we use this regularly.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />In conclusion, this is the best purchase we made for our daughter so far. She uses it regularly and loves it. Its helped her in many ways. Despite some annoyances such as the seat cloth attachment during assembly and weird fire-fly toy which just sits limped over out of sight, this is really a great product. I still give it 5 stars because from my daughters perspective it seems like she would also give it 5 stars considering the way she spends time with it. I would like to note one thing, sure she spends up to half an hour jumping and excited which often frees your hands and allows you to get other things done, don't let this be something that is used for that purpose and results in negligence to your child. Your child will also catch on and start to cry when you take them to this because they will know that your planning to leave her there while your not there, they will catch on. Let these kinds of products be something that the child can enjoy while your with them, because thats whats exciting to them, that your there watching them jump and have fun. Believe me you will love the smile on their face.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to you, thanks and best wishes with your child !<br /><br />Georgetil now w/o any problems.<br /><br />SPACE OCCUPIED:<br />The diameter as per my measurement with measuring tape is approx. 33 inches.

I put a book under her feet because she's too short to reach the floor to jump, which means this will last a long time, as she grows.  What makes it not perfect is that it's hard to get her into it, her body doesn't easily slide into the seat and her legs don't easily go through the leg holes.  The material was a PAIN to get onto the frame.  I finally grabbed a pair of hemostats to grasp the material and pull it over the little pegs.  It was like surgery!  When I had to take it off to wash I dreaded the task, but it turned out to be a bit easier the next time, getting it back on.  I was relieved and thought I was home free, but now the seat doesn't swivel as easily.  And this thing is HUGE.  It takes two adults to easily move it and it barely fits through a doorway.  Be prepared for it to take up a lot of floorspace.  People in small apartments or spaces should think twice about this model.<br /><br />Helpful hint:  to get the seat off to wash the liner, pop the legs off, then flip the seat over and push in the tabs, the seat will easily pop out of the frame.

With my second baby I knew I wanted a video monitor, and after extensive research and review reading, decided this M3 monitor looked like the best option.<br /><br />Pros: *Easy to set up.  My husband and I both use it on our Ipod Touch 5 and it was a breeze to set up.  You do have to plug it into your router the first time to activate it, but after that it's wireless.<br />  *Clear good picture, even at night.  The color is a little wonky, but we are mainly using it to see if the baby's really awake or just stirring around, not for award winning photos.  The night vision is really clear and can easily see if baby's eyes are open, etc.<br />  *Easy to maneuver around.  With just a swipe of the finger you can move the camera around the room to see all corners.<br />  *Easy to mount.  Screws and anchors included, & literally took 5 minutes to mount.<br />  *App is fairly easy to use.  The software is simple to use, though it's pretty bare-bones.<br /><br />Cons:  *The 2-way audio only works if you add on speakers, not included.<br />  *The cord is pretty short for a camera that needs mounted.  Due to the tilt restrictions, there was no way to see into the baby's crib without mounting the camera and an extension cord was necessary.  The camera plug is one of those big bulky ones, so we had to find something to rest it on halfway up the wall - kind of a hazard for something that's supposed to be installed in a baby room.<br />  *The alerts don't work when my ios device goes to sleep.  This is a BIG con...BIG.  Ios devices want to go to sleep to save battery, but for whatever reason the alerts don't go off when my Ipod goes into sleep / lock mode, but if you leave your screen on all the time, it drains the battery, so you have to keep it plugged in, which means you can't carry it around with you....not good.  Also, if you can't lock the screen the chances of your older toddler getting their hands on your Ipod and deleting some stuff ispretty high...also not good.<br />  *The FAQ from IBaby doesn't address the above issue, so I've contacted customer service to see if there is a work-around, but haven't heard back yet...<br />  *2 people can't really be in the app at the same time.  If 2 people have the app open and one changes the alert settings, it applies to everyone in the app.  So if my husband is at work and tunes in to have a look at the little one, and I have the alerts on, he's constantly getting the alerts as well...If he turns off the alerts, it turns them off on my device as well.  Kind of inconvenient.  It would be better if each user could set the alerts to their preference, rather than them being applied across the board.<br /><br />Summary:  Love that it's easy to install and great picture.  Love having video access to my little one's room.  Hate that the alerts don't work properly.<br /><br />UPDATE: I finally heard back from the company that makes the M3 with some suggestions on settings in my IOS device to make the alerts work.  Unfortunately their suggestions did not resolve the issue and then the alerts stopped working all together, even when the device was not sleeping.  I tried twice more to contact them with no response.  I contacted Amazon to see what my options were and they, thankfully, allowed me to return the monitor.  Based on the IBaby Labs customer service and the above listed cons to this monitor I would not recommend it if you intend to use it as a baby monitor.",2014-01-06

Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though! Just make sure to wash regularly and always inspect the pacifier before giving it to your child.ifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do.

It's really cute! The only problem is that after about 3 months, the big leaves stopped working. The leaves would go down but wouldn't come all the way back up again, and that stops the mobile from moving completely. We changed the batteries a couple times, thinking that perhaps the batteries were getting too weak to keep the leaves moving, but that didn't help. We ended up taking the 3 big leaves off the mobile so that the other parts could move again. It's not as cute though without all the leaves, and it's disappointing to have his mobile break after only a few months. There are several things that I really do like about the mobile and that work quite well. I like the remote control; we don't use it terribly often, but it works well and is nice when we want the music to continue but don't want our son to see us. I like the sound options: jungle noises and three different classical composers. Although the &#34;night light&#34; isn't bright and can't be used as a regular night light, our son likes to look at the lit up jungle scene.

This has been a lifesaver in our house. We are on our second child using the jumper and it has stood up superbly! The assembly was super easy and fast so we were using it within 20 minutes of opening it up. The unit has three levels of height so it last for a pretty long time while your child grows. I like that you can turn the music on or off and it has a volume control (high or low). The lights and activities included keep the children entertained and engaged without overwhelming them. The seat cover can be removed and washed which is a nice way to keep it looking clean and new. It is not the easiest thing to put back on but the ability to clean it makes it well worth the effort to take it off and put it back on. I also take off the toy attachments on a pretty regular basis and wash those down since the little hands and mouth are on them at all times. I would recommend this to any parent!,2014-01-18

A flood of friends commented that I need to forget the simple paci and graduate to the wubbanub.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, I'll try it. After a month, i love it! Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />--my daughter can easily hold it and put it in her mouth. She doesn't quite have the motor skills to get the nipple of the paci in her mouth without the Wubbanub attachment.<br />--The hands and feet have little beany things in them, which makes them fun for my daughter to chew on. She's teething now and I think those beany things provide a nice texture for her. The fabric material of the Wubbanub is also soothing to her while she munches down on the feet and hands of the little monkey.<br />--It's machine-washable! Wahoo!<br /><br />Cons:<br />--This thing is filthy. My daughter has been chewing on it a lot lately because of the teething thing. In fact, she doesn't really use the paci part at all right now. So because the fabric part is in her mouth so much, it's a really dirty toy. I would absolutely recommend buying a darker color Wubbanub and washing it often. I have friends that have lighter color ones and they just look so, so dirty and gross.<br /><br />--My daughter is in a dropping phase. We love toys that can be hooked onto her seat or stroller. Unfortunately, this monkey Wubbanub cannot be hooked onto anything. I could probably improvise by either making a hook thing myself with a suspender clip and ribbon, but it would be great if this came with a loop that I could hook a ribbon or other pre-made device through.<br /><br />All in all, my friends are right: the Wubbanub is fantastic and my daughter absolutely loves it!<br /><br />Updated 5/13/2016<br />When my second daughter was born, we bought another monkey &#34;Wubby&#34; for her and she has slept with it every night since she was about 3 months old. I put a paci clip through the hole in the pacifier so she can have it attached to her pajamas and never lose it at night. This has been the perfect solution to every missing paci issue.<br /><br />However, a couple of weeks ago (when she was 18 months old), she bit off the tip of the pacifier. I couldn't find it anywhere and assumed she swallowed it...I found it yesterday on the living room floor (no idea how it got there). I contacted the company to let them know what happened and to ask if this is normal. Most of my friends have wubbys and use them for years as their security toy. The company said that the Wubbanub is not for older babies--just babies 0-6 months old and that they are working on products for older kids. SOOOOO...bear in mind that the Wubby is only for babies 0-6 months. The company refunded my money, which I thought was an incredibly nice gesture that I didn't even ask for.<br /><br />I let my 18 month old have the monkey part of the wubby with the nipple cut off so she can't chew it off any more. The monkey stays with her in her crib at night and is her favorite toy/security item.ept with it every night since she was about 3 months old.

We've tried the summer line, but the device's kept failing, so in a pinch ordered the Withings Smart baby Monitor.  The initial setup took a few tries and a good long charge before it worked, but eventually we got the device working.  However, it suffers from three major problems:<br /><br />The iPhone app just sort of sucks.  It works in the most basic function, but the notifications and multiple account features have never worked so my mother in law continues to get notifications that the humidity int he room has dropped too low.<br /><br />More importantly, you cannot keep a connection to the monitor.  This is probably the most important problem, as the monitor drops the connections, is unable to reconnect.  This usually generates a notification, but then you have to wake-up and reconnect the app.  We live in a modest sized apartment and can literally see the wireless router from all the rooms and the nursery.<br /><br />Lastly, the customer service that I have now been exchanging emails with for the past two weeks is pretty terrible.  There is no, speak with a human support.  Each communication takes a day to respond, and they ask you to make the same changes over and over, not surprisingly they don't work.  I have requested a refund multiple times, but have never received it.  Overall this is a couple hundred bucks down the drain.",2014-01-24

I had visions of my baby spending 15-20 minutes a day in here unsupervised, so I could take a shower or eat something or just be, you know, alone. He will jump and play with the toys, but not for very long, before he starts whining to be picked up or put somewhere else. Also, the swivel chair doesn't swivel very easily for us: my baby only faces outward toward the main toy bar (he has to crane his neck to see the sun and the lizard, forget about it). Kinda useless unless it's easy to swivel around (he's only 7 months, maybe it'll get looser?). The rainbow is not very intriguing for babies; I wish there were more light-up parts. The music is okay, and the parrot/lizard hanging don't get any love from my baby. It takes up a HUGE footprint in the living room though, and you can't take it apart very easily.

It's very useful to be able to see and hear what is going on at home using the iPhone app. Be sure to change the password to something besides the default for security.<br /><br />Update 2017.07.25: two iBaby M3 cameras have been in use continuously since August of 2013 (four years). We use them for elder care purposes. If you connect some low-cost self-powered speakers the two-way audio can be useful when interacting with home care nurses. It takes a little Googling but you can use port forwarding on your home router plus dynamic DNS as one way to make the camera accessible from outside the home. The iBaby app is ok, but we have used the FoscamPro app to view and control multiple cams (iBaby M3 can be added as if it is a Foscam FI8910W).<br /><br />Both power plugs failed recently within weeks of each other.

One of my twins broke the monitor, I think she kicked it really hard and not only broke the micro usb cord itself (part of it got stuck in the monitor), she also broke the micro usb connection to the circuit board inside the monitor.  I contacted Withings customer service and they helped me figure out that this wasn't a simple fix, and since I was within the warranty period, I sent the broken monitor back and they sent me a new one!  I thought for sure we'd go through some long process of sending it back to fix it and I'd be without a monitor for months, but this went really quickly, and I soon had a brand new monitor in hand.<br /><br />I still have some connectivity issues), but you can't beat customer service like that.  Thank you Withings!<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br />I really want to like this, it looks beautiful out of the box, set up was relatively easy, and then the issues started...  My iphone and ipad both drop the signal from the monitor ALL THE TIME!  It seems like is nearly always either loading or just plain disconnected.  I live in an apartment, so I can actually hear any baby noises from one end to the other, so I rarely rely on this for sound, but the video is why I registered for the monitor.<br /><br />We've tried reconfiguring the location of our wireless router to see if that would help to no avail.  One thing I did find that helped some was just unplugging the monitor and plugging it back in when the connectivity fails repeatedly.  The old \\""have you tried turning it off and on again\\"" trick...<br /><br />Overall, for this price, it needs to maintain a connection.  I literally just lost to the connection to the monitor as I wrote this review.  Better go check on the babies, since I can't rely on my expensive technology to work.",2014-02-07

I noticed my 4-month old was only using her left hand to play and became fussy.  I looked to maybe adjust her to another boring toy and noticed she spun and her right arm became stuck between the elephant ear and spinning harness and was turning red.  The elephant does not spin in a way to easily dislodge a child's stuck arm so I had to calm her and slowly spin her the opposite way while stabilizing her curious hand and freed her arm.  This is by far the most boring, single tuned baby hazard I have seen in a while.  The activities make your baby have to look over the edge of the spinning insert for a limited view of fixed elements to apparently explore.  It plays one boring tune and makes her fussy.  I do not recommend due to the hazard issue I experienced and glad she got fussy to realize what was happening and I was sitting with her the whole time...it has enough room to get an arm in to be stuck and not enough room for a curious baby to easily remove said stuck arm without potential harm.

From the beginning we just get a bunch of connection interrupted messages and it takes turning if off and back on to get it up and running again if it will run again without rebooting the entire system. For a monitor that is suppose to give you instant piece of mind it really just gives you a headache.

When it works, it's good (not great).<br /><br />If you are able to set it up easily, you'll like the baby monitor (hence all the positive reviews).  When you run into ANY issues at all (and most people will run into some issue at some point), you will hate the monitor, it's trouble-shooting guide, and Withings customer service.<br /><br />I've had connection issues in the past (I had one phone connected and wanted to connect another phone).  I followed the steps set-up guide/FAQ (and I'm usually pretty tech savvy) and it took me about an hour of button pushing to &#34;fix&#34; it.  The instructions were useless, and I still don't know exactly how I got it to do what I wanted it to.  And mind you, there's all of ONE button, it's how long and how frequently you push it that determines what the resulting action is.<br /><br />I also get annoyed with the color/infrared camera.  There are some types of light where the monitor has trouble picking the correct viewing mode.  It would be vastly (and easily) improved if you could force the monitor to use a certain camera seeing as how your eyes are the ones viewing the screen...<br /><br />Finally, I've had the monitor for under a year now, and it refuses to charge.  I have an email out to Withings Customer Service, but I'm not very optimistic.  I will get back and update my review once I hear from them.<br /><br />If this monitor cost around $100, the issues I've had to deal with would be reasonable.

But one complaint.,"I bought this for my 3 month old because he is developmentally ahead of schedule with head control and sitting up. He was getting easily bored and needed something upright to entertain him and to work on other skills. I researched jumperoos and exercausers for  days and finally bought this one. Overall, I'm happy with it. Even though he is too short for it, he still fits in the seat and can reach some of the toys (we just put books under his feet). I love the music (it's not overly obnoxious) and I love the variety of toys to keep his attention. He LOVES it.<br /><br />Here's my one complaint: I am VERY disappointed with the 360 degree seat. It really doesn't rotate easily. If I'm having a hard time spinning it, it will be impossible for my son. I'm hoping it will loosen up a bit, which is why I didn't return it, and he loves it so much, but I wish it spun better. We've tried soaping it up, we've double checked the cloth to make sure it wasn't getting stuck, and tried to wear in the wheels. Nothing worked. Sigh.",2014-03-18

Those of you who are lucky enough to have this product function like it's supposed to...are lucky.<br /><br />I've been using this monitor for about 3 months now, and it's been an absolute mess.  We had absolutely no problems setting it up on any of our devices (iPhone 4s, 5s, and iPad Air), but that was the extent of easiness we've experienced.<br /><br />Straight up--This monitor doesn't monitor.  All day and night, it's constantly connecting/reconnecting.  I rarely see actual video of my baby in her crib.  It's always a still frame of her that was pulled from whenever it last connected.  Through the night, I'm woken up off and on by the horrific sound of the notifier telling me that my connection has been lost and cannot be found...and it SHUTS DOWN THE APP COMPLETELY.  While I'm sleeping.  And I wake up to silence.  No monitoring sound or video--Just silence--as it's reconnecting.  It's infuriating.<br /><br />The entire POINT of a baby monitor is to let you know if your baby needs you.  And this monitor doesn't do that.  Sometimes it acts possessed.  On occasion it DOES work, and when I had notifiers turned on for noise or movement in the baby's room, it would sound the notifier for EVERYTHING, no matter how much I messed with the thresholds.  Now?  They don't even work because for some reason, it just can't stay connected.  I've power cycled and removed the battery and done everything too many times to count to get it working like it's supposed to.<br /><br />And now, the app crashes with any notification due to the recent iOS update.<br /><br />The app hasn't been updated since October 2013, and it needs a TON of work.  The thresholds for temperature and humidity reset themselves constantly, and it appears that my connection problems might be related as well.  I don't have any issues with any of my other wireless devices in our house-Just this one.  Sometimes it will pull up the video feed, and there will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.  The supposed bluetooth connection is non-existent.  It will connect when you first connect it, and then it just shuts off completely.  I've never seen it actually connect and monitor using the bluetooth connection.<br /><br />Bottom line?  You want a baby monitor to monitor your baby.  And this product just doesn't do that very often.  It will cause you more frustration and headache than the bells and whistles are worth.  If it worked correctly, this monitor would be amazing, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm about to go buy another monitor.  Ugh.  Please don't waste your money on this.ere will be a cached still of the crib from an earlier session showing underneath a still picture of what's currently happening in the crib.

Originally 4-stars were given based on the product not working with Android (the 5 different devices we have in our household) even though Withings states that it should work on all versions of Android. I should note that I have devices with the latest version of Android ranging to a few releases older than the newest hotness. To get the Baby Monitor to function I re-purposed an iPod Touch. Apple support for their mobile app seems to be great .. I understand nailing a working Android app is difficult given the multiple version of Android, the matrix of hardware, as well as carrier crapware .. still you pay premium for a Baby Monitor it should just work. Calls to support yielded &#34;we're sorry, not much we can do.&#34;<br /><br />I'm updating to 2-star due to the lack of support on a premium product. Last week the monitor disconnected from our wifi network and I've been unable to get it to reconnect nor a hard reset resets the Monitor to a state where bluetooth enabled devices can see it. This is unfortunate because Amazon's warranty just ran out. Working with Withings support has been unhelpful.<br /><br />The staff have walked me through debugging the device using support documents that I already discovered and tried before pinging them (you can google the docs). Each email exchange takes +24 hours or more. This is unhelpful at best and frustrating to say the least, having a support email consist of &#34;does the blue light still blink after you do ...&#34; and then not responding for a few days makes a process that should be somewhat straightforward not. A simple live chat feature or phone call would likely solve the problem quickly letting me know if the device is dead or in their wizardary it can be resolved.<br /><br />Having a new born and no baby monitor should be viewed as a sev-1 by any support team.",2014-04-01

We bought it when our son was 5 months old, he was so little but had really good control of his head so he jumped in this twice daily for 45 minutes each! He was so cute jumping! He is 11 months old and still loves jumping in it. He was pulling up on furniture and walking around at 9 1/2 months so I dont feel like he was in it too much. I know every baby is different, but if they love it then there really isnt too much time spent in it and babies are only little once. Also, It is very easy to clean ( Clorox wipe the hard plastic and machine wash everything else) and is VERY entertaining.  I wish I had bought this for my 4 year old son when he was that little, I had the door jumper and I was so scared that it would fall and he would get hurt so he didn't really use it. This jumperoo is well built and sturdy. The toys that come with it are cute. The cons about this are minor, there is only one or two songs and it gets pretty annoying, I had to take the batteries out for a week to have peace and quiet, then i felt bad so I put them back in. It can get pretty loud when he jumps, but that is with any jumperoo or exersaucer. I will say that this is quieter than his exersaucer. I think the price is fair, although for some families it might be alot for a toy used for a few months. It is definitely worth it,  my son loves it.

Our advice: If your child doesn't warm up to the jumperoo right off the bat, give him/her a week or two to get acquainted with it before you give up on it. My wife and I also like how this jumperoo folds up for storage unlike other, bulkier options, and we both like that there are volume options as well as options for more sound, less sound, or no sound. Others have commented that the saucer is somewhat difficult to maneuver. It is, so you'll likely have to twist your child around yourself in order for him/her to access all the different toys. I wouldn't list this as a con, though, since I wouldn't want an easily spinning saucer (like one with wheels on a track) to be coupled with springs/bouncing.

Luckily there is a setting for the music to play only when he jumps. One thing that was slightly disappointing was the bee. It's too top heavy to stand on it's own so it just hangs of the side. I don't understand what the point of the bee is to just hang. Like I said that's only slightly disappointing so I still give it 5 stars!,2014-04-11

I had the pleasure of attending CES in 2012 and I saw Withings products first-hand I was really impressed. - As an Android fan, I was a little miffed that everything was tailored for Apple products, but I remained hopeful that they would soon be Android compatible. When I found out that they were, I told my wife so much about the monitor that she was interested too.<br /><br />The monitor was delivered on April 8, 2014.  The packaging was fantastic.<br /><br />The monitor itself felt pretty solid, even if it was a bit bulky and clunky.  Still, I like the simple design and the overall feel of the monitor. Inside the box was a power cord with multiple attachments for various outlets as well as the monitor stand and the instruction manual. Also included was an &#34;Android Quick Start Guide&#34; which was nothing other than a square of paper with a link top the app on the Google Play Store.<br /><br />When I tried to set up the monitor, I began experiencing some serious issues. The instruction manual ONLY has instructions for setting up the monitor with an iPhone or iPad. Nowhere in the manual are there any Android specific instructions, so I proceeded with the iPhone instructions. I was able to get the monitor paired with my device via Bluetooth and had the monitor and phone connected to my Wi-Fi. I was able to turn the night light on and off, as well as the lullaby feature with no issue. I could also speak into my phone and have my voice projected via the monitor. What I couldn't get was the video - which was the MAIN reason for getting this type of monitor. I tried restarting everything but I got the same result each and every time. I even went so far as to factory reset the monitor, uninstall the app from my device, and start all over again.  Same thing - no video, but everything else worked. I also had purchased a new cable modem/router, so I installed that, got it all activated through my provider and tried AGAIN with the Withings monitor to no avail. The only time I could get the video to work was when I connected the monitor and the router via an ethernet cord. Even then, I was able to get the video working on my device, but wife wife could not connect at all. I tried disconnecting my device then connecting hers (we both have the same Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 4.4.2) but her's would not connect.<br /><br />Exasperated, I attempted to contact Withings via their website, but that communication seems to have fallen on deaf ears because I never received any sort of response at all from them.  It's really disheartening as I was really hoping this monitor would work flawlessly as advertised, but it just didn't -- and it was disappointing. What made it even worse was the complete lack of communication from Withings - one would hope that a company would do their best to ensure a top-notch customer experience, but, in all honesty, they seem to lack any sort of customer service whatsoever.<br /><br />In short, I would say that I could not possibly ever recommend this product to anyone with an Android device. It just simply did not work as advertised, and trying to get support from Withings is impossible.ough my provider and tried AGAIN with the Withings monitor to no avail.

She started using it when she was just 3 months old. Mind you, her feet don't even come close to reach the floor, even with the jumperoo at its lowest setting. Initially we put a pillow under her feet. Now she uses layered rubber alphabet mats, and we remove a layer as she gets taller. She might reach the floor at 6-7 months or so. The seat does an excellent job of supporting her, even back when she was 3 months old and didn't have the best head control. As she's gotten older, this toy has become more and more fun for her, to the point where she looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />A couple of observations regarding some of the other reviews I read on here (I read tons of them before deciding to buy this thing):<br /><br />- a lot of people complain that the elephant is facing the wrong way and hard to turn. The elephant is SUPPOSED to be facing the wrong way, the idea is for kids to turn him towards them, and then he swings back when they let go. There are animal sounds that get generated which correspond to most of the animal toys, including an elephant trumpeting sound. When that sound happens, I turn the elephant toward my daughter so she can associate it. I admit that the spring in the elephant is initially way too stiff for most children, but IT'S ADJUSTABLE! Just raise the elephant a bit and make him do a full clockwise turn, and voila, the tension is relieved. Now any kid can turn the elephant when they hear its sound.<br /><br />- I read some reviewers who claimed that their jumperoo came unhitched from one of the springs, causing their child to fall out. There's one such review in particular which has been pasted on here and many other reseller and manufacturer web sites, mostly verbatim on each one. Honestly, after seeing how this thing is hooked up, I can't understand how it could come unhitched accidentally. I suppose it's possible if the child jumped up way too high and the thing was set too low to begin with. Those reviews scared me a bit, but after seeing the attachment mechanism, I no longer have any concerns.<br /><br />- Someone mentioned that this thing could harm development of a child due to the impacts. That's ludicrous. Besides, our daughter spends at most 30 minutes in there, always supervised. I enjoy playing with her while she's in there. It's a fun activity we can do together.",2014-04-14

I say this because the monitor has many awesome features that you would love right out of the box, but once you try to rely on it you will realize how unreliable it is.<br /><br />I think other reviewers highlighted many of its pros and cons, but I think that any prospective buyer should be aware of one serious and dangerous flaw that makes this product not only worthless, but also harmful! At least once every one or two weeks the connection with the video feed will freeze, but instead of giving you a warning that the connection is frozen you will get a still image while the sound continues to work. So if the image freezes at a point when the baby is sound asleep and not moving you will continue to get this image regardless of what the baby is doing! My wife removed our baby from the crib and I was looking at the monitor and it continued to show me my baby sleeping in the crib!

Checked reviews, did my own research at the baby stores, etc. I originally had gotten the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn and I returned it because it was just too clunky. It did not fold up to store and it had a huge piece that went overhead that I didn't like. I received the Fisher Price Step 'N Play as a gift and my baby when she was 6 months and I love that one, but it doesn't jump and I found my daughter wanting to always jump as she learns to crawl, stand and get more mobile at 8 months old. So I got this one because a ton of my friends have it for their babies. I also put my baby in it to see if she liked it and she did! I put this together in about 10 minutes, I've adjusted in about 3 minutes. My daughter loves it and I love it. I would definitely recommend this and think this is one of the better jumpers that Fisher Price has designed.",2014-04-29

I can put him for about 30 mins or a lil longer while i do laundry or clean the house.

I think this company makes high quality and well designed toys and offers them at fair prices. This is how my little one entered the world of toys. We have dee-dee dragon, captan calamari, octopus and various other small soft toys from lamaze. We put them close to my son's bed a few weeks after he was born. You can also attach them to the crib or the stroller using the top white circle which is a plus.<br /><br />It took a month or so for my son to show interest to these colorful toys. This is probably because of the fact that newborns can only see, black-white and red properly until they get a few months old. But after that he really enjoyed playing with this one and the other lamaze toys. There are many different colors and each part feels different to touch (rough, smooth, squeaky or fluffy...) Besides it has a rattle (the purple ball like thing it holds). So it offers audiovisual plus tactile stimulation.<br /><br />For proper brain development, experts recommend offering as many age-appropriate stimulus as you can and that helps smooth integration to the surrounding world too. Apart from the rattle bit and the white circular bit, which is rounded,  there is no hard plastic, so it is very unlikely that a baby can hurt himself while playing with that.<br /><br />It is easy to clean and it should be cleaned often.

I thought the animal attached would keep it from getting knocked too far away from baby, and he could get back in his mouth easier. I also thought when he spit it out and I was holding him, it would be easier to catch that most pacis. Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly. Baby loves it a lot though and loves to just hold it even when he doesn't want to suck on it, so for that I don't regret buying it at all.",2014-06-25

Red thread and sign looks good- almost gives it a reasonably expensive look. My issue with this product and the main reason why it received 3 out of 5 starts, are straps. The threading from those come off- almost as if it needed a stitch around versus just through and through. Also, these straps obviously wont help you if your stroller has a handle that is at an angle. I have Mamas and Papas Armadillo stroller and the handle is at an angle and its not adjustable. That is not buggy design's fault, but even if the handle was perfectly perpendicular to the ground, the straps seem to be too flimsy to give this organizer a somewhat sturdier placement.

It works so well when it works, and for that I would give it 5 stars. However, it has some very real issues inherent in its design that you should know going in if you decide to purchase.<br /><br />1. The baby monitor is only as strong as your wireless signal. If you plan to use it while you're working out in the yard or in the basement, and your signal isn't very strong in those areas, this might not be your best bet. Otherwise be prepared to spend even more money to boost your router with a range extender to get the coverage you need.<br /><br />2. Even in close proximity with good signal, the device disconnects frequently, and doesn't make it obvious to you on your phone that it has done so, failing to reconnect. (Unless you're sitting there using your phone.)<br /><br />3. The battery doesn't last long at all. Whenever we put our daughter down for a nap in a different area of the house and have set this up to run on battery, it only lasts about 10-15 minutes before it dies completely.<br /><br />4. Cellular coverage doesn't last long either. Theoretically this would be an ideal backup for those out-of-range areas if you're working out in the yard, for it to connect via your cellular network. And theoretically, it does this. However, it'll only keep you connected for 10 minutes that way, so this is not a sustainable option if your babe is taking a long nap and you've got gardening to do or another project outside of the house.<br /><br />All in all, we do use it. We're stubborn iphone users and having made this purchase I'm not in a hurry to replace it with something else for a second device to have to carry around. I have to believe Withings could improve some of these features, though, to make for a more seamless user experience. As it is, it's kind of a pain and only a little but useful.",2014-07-07

When she first started using it, she was a bit small so we put a pillow underneath her feet.  For the most part she just sort of looked at the flashing lights and occasionally licked the seat fabric.  She was usually content for about 10-15 minutes at a time at 4 months old.  Now at 9 months old she is a bouncing machine.  I put her in it every morning while I eat breakfast and she is usually happy bouncing for about 25-30 minutes!  Enough time for me to eat and get some coffree (YAY).<br /><br />At 9 months, we still have it on the lowest height setting, so she still has tons of room to grow with this.  My baby is about 25% for height and about 5% for weight (I am not sure if heavier babies would pull this down more or not).  We tried bumping it up to the middle height setting, but her feet were just barely touching the ground, so we put it back down to the lowest for a little longer.",2014-07-17

Period.","I was very excited about this product, based on other amazon customers' recommendations. However, this jumperoo is unsafe and I am afraid to leave my baby in it. I have five main objections: 1) the spinning elefant is so close to the bar that it snaped my own finger painfully as I was showing it to my 6 mo old baby - I am really worried that my son's little hand will get hurt by it; 2) as all babies, my son is trying to put the toys he is playing with into his mouth, which causes him to move forward impulsively while inside the jumperoo. He banged his head on the sun toy, and on another occasion, hurt his upper lip on the green bar where the parrot toy is hanging; 3) the jumperoo is overstimulating - it &#34;attacks&#34; the baby's brain with stimulation coming from everywhere around him. All the toys rattle when you touch one of them, which breaks the baby's concentration as he is exploring one toy and makes him search nervously for what is making noise behind his back. I am worried that this toy is encouraging ADD!!! 4) my son is a very active kid, but because of getting busy with all these noisy toys, he hardly has the time to jump. I was hoping to get more physical excerce out of a toy callled a &#34;jumpreoo.&#34; Very, very disappointed and would not recomment this to anyone.",2014-07-21

Unfortunately, we didn't end up buying this one until she was four to five months, which was probably a little late to fully use it given she was walking by 10 months. We borrowed a similar version while on a trip around the three month mark (before she rolled over or was very mobile), and she absolutely loved the walls and being able to move herself around by pushing against them.

I went out the next day and got him this monkey. While it hasn't made much of a difference in his night waking, he has started getting quite attached to the monkey. It helps him go down for naps so much better (especially for my husband). I think having the stuffed animal on the pacifier really helps because he has something else to hold.

I also really like that I can hang it from his activity mat and I think he gets fascinated by the colors. That said, this took over a month to arrive from when I ordered it, but I waited patiently. When it did arrive, stuffing was coming out of stitching lines that weren't straight and strings were hanging off everywhere. Ok, so I cut off the strings and pulled what stuffing I could see out of it. But this toy's washing instructions are surface only washing. So it was a pain to have to get every crevice I possible could clean with sanitizing wipes since I knew my baby would put it in his mouth the first chance he got.

But the USB port on the device, the little port that connects the cable to charge the monitor was so tiny that if you didn't plug it in correctly it would BREAK!  So customer service was great and gave us a replacement. (even though it was 1 month later!)  But the SAME thing happened to the second!!!  This made us furious!!  Call it human error, but this monitor is so delicate that if baby pulls on the cable the whole thing falls apart and it can't be charged anymore!!!  Also, the base on which the monitor stands in on the crib is so loose that with any movement our baby made, the monitor would fall into the crib!!!!! BIG BABY DANGER!!

But it's perfect.  Seriously.  The velcro on the straps are strong so I'm not worried about it falling off even if I cram the organizer full of junk.  It has 2 bottle holder compartments, one on each side.  One is ever so slightly larger than the other on mine, so I use the slightly larger one for my water bottle and the smaller one for my 2 year old.  There is a hidden zipper pocket that I use to store my keys so I don't lose it.  I'll also put extra hair clips in there to so I always have one just in case.  The actual body of the organizer is huge.  We used this on a trip to Sesame Place and it held both my Samsung Galaxy S4 and my husband's iPhone 5, the map of the amusement park, 3 oz sunblock tube, a small sunblock face stick, the souvenir drink bottle, a stainless steel water bottle, and my eye drops.  I didn't have to dig around to find anything.  I didn't have to readjust the straps at all.<br /><br />I have used this on my uppababy vista and the summer infant umbrella stroller.

The noises are easy to put up with, with for me is a big plus because you will hear it often.  My little ones love bouncing in it to make the sound go off.  It is stimulating enough to get their attention and to make them happy, but not so that it over-stimulates them. I like the swivel chair and it is soft on their legs.<br /><br />Another pro that stands out is that it is helpful for their hips.

Ever since, it's truly a toss-up regarding whether this thing is going to work or not. It is constantly losing connectivity and trying to reconnect, even when our router is literally in the same room as the monitor and crib! Not having connectivity when trying to figure out if your baby has rolled onto his stomach, see if he's asleep and getting the rest he needs or still awake, see if he's crying and standing or just whimpering and still laying down and might settle himself back to sleep, etc. is just not acceptable. I can't sleep train if I have to go into the room and disconnect and reconnect the monitor to get it working again! And if you've got an andriod, forget it. When and if this monitor works, I have to rely on using my husband's iPad since it completely stopped working on my android after a couple months.

She had let me borrow it for my baby (who is now a toddler). And now my other aunt is borrowing the jumper for her grandchild. I like how well made material on the seat is. The poles that hold up do get wobbly but it still works. I'd definitely say this jumper is a must have if you want a good easy to jump activity toy for your baby. It lasts long too if you want something to keep for your next babies. My toddlers favorite toy was chewing on the butterfly and spinning the sun. The leaves where the stuffed birds on the poles can adjust for babies reach. I should've have known to buy this instead of getting the baby einstein musical motion jumper. Reason why is because the seat on the einstein jumper seam had ripped at 4 days old. The baby seat material is NOT great as this jumper. And it is harder for my baby to jump in it. If you want a good, easy to jump entertainer that lasts long GET THIS ONE. If you want an activity set like the baby einstein jumper that has tons of toys to keep baby entertained go for that. But I'd definitely recommend this jumper. My biggest regret is buying that baby einstein jumper. I hope this review helps.",2014-10-26

I haven't tried the natural style so I can't offer anything on the use of these disc and that bottle style. For the classic, replace the nipple in the screw ring with the disk. It should fit snugly and click or pop when in place. I suggest doing a test run on the disc with water to make sure that they are in place properly. As with the classic, the adapter ring must be in use in order to prevent leakage. I bought extra screw rings myself to make switching from nipple to disc much easier to do while being on the go. Over all, these are a great buy for any mom whose nursing and want to pump directly into the bottle and store.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/5/2017<br />I've now has these sealing disc since late 2014 and I must say that my sealing disc have taken a beating. They have been used with the original classic bottle mostly for storage with the screw rings with no problems. Classic plus I do not own as it would have been a waste of money seeing how my original classics are in good shape.  I did go on to purchase a couple of the natural bottles and these work perfectly fine with that bottle also. The disc in all Avent bottles sticks out in the middle, it isn't a flat sealing disc. It does what it should do, protect mama's liquid gold while in transport or storage. Sealing disc has help up to repeated use, washes and even being in a bottle warmer. If any other parents is breastfeeding and looking for a bottle that can also be used for storage, I would highly recommend Avent bottles/sealing discs!<br /><br />Another thing is that, the price of these is very reasonable and they can be replaced easily if lost for some reason.",2014-11-21

We bought this mobile in 2008, for our daughter, and it always worked fine with no problems.    However, getting it back out for our son in January revealed the seemingly common problem - it appeared as if the big leaves were too heavy, catching on the spinning part and stopping it from moving properly.    I tried bending the leaves back in to shape (it seemed like they weren't in the right position and not moving high enough out of the way) and it seemed to work for a couple of spins, but then it started again.    So I took it apart! Only the motorised bit of course, which can be removed from the base unit.    Inside you will see quite an elaborate cog mechanism, don't take this apart! This is the motor and should still be fine.    You will see how the mechanism works - there is a circular piece of plastic that runs around the inside of the rim and is responsible for the rise and fall of the leaves. You can see the grooves, a pattern of 2 small and 1 big, which is how the leaves behave (2 'jumps' and then they close down once).    The whole inside of the rim should be greased in order for everything to move easily. Over time, this dries out and needs to be replaced (similarly to just about every other electronic item with moving parts). I used petroleum jelly for the job and it's been fine ever since. You can use this, or something similar, but my friend asked me if vegetable/sunflower oil would be okay. Of course, the answer is certainly not! This solidifies in to a resinous substance that will ruin the whole thing (and is also partly why I only use lard or dripping to fry with now, but that's a different story!).    Our son, his mummy and I have been enjoying the mobile ever since :-)    I hope this has helped (or will help) at least one person our there.    The actual product is lovely too - the classical songs and rainforest noises are very calming without being intrusive whilst the movement is gentle and quite mesmerising too! The remote works reasonably well, as long as you aren't too far away, and is rarely needed anyway.",2014-11-23

We purchased others as gifts and have heard nothing but positive things.  One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.

I bought the Rainforest because there was a review saying that Rainforest's seat turns more easily, and the toys are closer to baby's hand; these aren't true. My 5 month son would never be able to turn the seat by himself, I have to turn it for him. I tried to reinstall it thinking may be fabric stuck on the wheel, but no, it's just how it is. The size of the table is the same, toys aren't closer but he can reach. One negative comment about the Rainforest is that two toys out of 5 are similar; the egg shaped clear plastic which turns, there are two of them. I would rather get Luv Zoo because there are more varieties. He seems to be entertained enough by just jumping, so at minimum, that's the best feature of this product.<br /><br />Another point: I asked a question that if I can take a part once I put together, I have to put them in a suitcase. Two people said yes; not true. You can take the legs a part, but not the toys on the table. Once you set it, it's set. You cannot put them back in a box or in a suitcase.

Meanwhile, you're sweating and your baby, who has previously shown no interest in the toy and in fact cries any time you even hover her over it, is wailing in your ear and pulling all your hair out in a fit of rage because it's been 15 minutes and you're on strap 1 of 3 and she really needs to use the Jumperoo. And then you finally get the first one done! Actually that wasn't so bad and now you've figured out a strategy and the next 2 are going to be a breeze. But wait. Somehow, whatever strategy you've figured out doesn't work now and you're back to the drawing board. 30 minutes later, after unimaginable sweating and frustration, you've done it and you're not even happy or relieved.

This product is marketed and sold as a high end baby monitor, and it's been anything but that in our experience. After 2 years of almost constant disconnecting (it operates on your home wifi network), it is finally just completely dead and doesn't work at all. It required constant rebooting of our electronic devices to reset the program in order for us to be able to see our baby.<br />In addition to a poor quality product, Withings literally DOES NOT allow customer service phone calls. I have never experienced such a thing in my life - especially with products that are sold at this price point. As I am currently on bed rest awaiting our new baby's arrival, I attempted to contact them to see how they could help me solve for a product that literally no longer works at all. The only option they provided to me was back and forth emailing with delays, and multiple requests for troubleshooting my device and sending them pictures at each juncture. I have never experienced such poor customer service; it's unthinkable to operate this way for a device that is directly tied to baby/child safety. Certainly this is unacceptable for baby industry items. As a final blow, they have offered me 25% off the purchase price of a new device. Is this a joke?? I would never PURCHASE another Withings item at all.<br />In addition, I must say I have been equally disappointed with Amazon customer service in this as well. Amazon was unwilling to accept a return (30 day return policy on baby items) despite the unique circumstances. Amazon was also unable to provide me with a customer service number for Withings. I told my Amazon customer service agent that I could not imagine allowing sales from vendors for which you could not literally contact by phone. I would expect Amazon to hold their sellers to a higher standard for customer service. I am familiar that other retailers like Target, Bed, Bath & Beyond, and even Walmart have standards for requiring this of vendors. When I asked to speak with a Customer Service manager at Amazon, she ended up giving me a phone number for a seller of other Withings products, but when I contacted them, they told me they had never actually sold the Smart Baby Monitor device, and they were unsure why Amazon would have given me their phone number.<br />In summary, I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. Buy a great baby monitor from companies that stand behind their products (Summer, Phillips, etc), and purchase from a retailer with reasonable return policies who also require their suppliers to maintain customer service.",2014-12-03

I tried to get it to work after that experience but it didn't loosen up any. After a second frustrating experience at a public bathroom-- I took this out of my diaper bag permanently. A few or two later I came across this and all the wipes were dried out. Just stick with the portable, disposable wipes with the hard plastic open/close feature (target brand , pampers and huggies all have these). They will be MUCH easier to use-- and the wipes case diminishes in size as you use them- and you can throw away the bag when you are done.<br /><br />Save your $$- skip this one. It isn't helpful.

I bought the Jumperoo for my 6 month old baby who could stay seated without support at the time. I had to put a box (2&#34; thick) under his feet as he was still too short to touch the ground (my baby was on the smaller side then). With time, he started to play and discover different activities within the Jumperoo. Initially, he liked to pull and chew on the butterfly. Then he discovered the rolling wheel. Just recently, he realized the elephant could turn towards him if he just pulled on the ear. He just turned 9 months old and discovered the relationship between pushing a button and making the head of a tiger peek out from behind. He can wildly jump in this jumperoo and play with all the attached toys for almost 30 minutes. His leg muscles have gotten stronger as a result. A good way to get my baby tired before a nap. We never put the batteries into the jumperoo as I saw no need. I am guessing it helps play music and turn some lights on?",2014-12-15

Look elsewhere for a baby monitor.,"This was given to us as a gift after reading about it and requesting it for our baby on the way.  When we purchased it we were under the impression the company supported Android devices.  After receiving it we tried time and time again to get this to work with our Galaxy S5s to no avail.<br />I emailed the company about this and after no real luck I received an email weeks later from Withings that stated, &#34;at this time the Android app is not our top priority&#34;.  For a decided costing north of $200 and we'll over the market average it better be your priority.<br />We really wanted to use this device because of how well we were told it worked with Apple devices.<br />We have now purchased two Ipod touches to use specifically for this baby monitor.  For the most part we are happy with this devices capabilities.  You can charge the battery and unplug it and place it in differnt places easily.<br /><br />You may be wondering why it is receiving 1 star.  This is why: After my interaction with the company I cannot in good faith recommend this to someone else.  Android OS is the most popular mobile OS in the world and they do not support it.  In fact, just yesterday my wife Uninstalled and tried to reinstall the app and it had been removed from the Play Store.  I am afraid to upgrade the iOS on our ipods because I fear losing compatibility with the monitor.  After speaking with the company I think it is reasonable to expect this is a possibility.<br /><br />Buyer beware.  Look for another device.  Unless you are okay with terrible customer service for any issues you may have.  They have no phone number to contact.  Email only.  And take a long time to respond.<br /><br />UPDATE: Baby monitor stopped working completely.  Will not turn on.  No responses.  Paper weight.",2014-12-22

Our little guy was starting to show signs of being bored with his swing and seemed to want more action. The first time we put him in (he was 5.5 months old--now he's at the ripe old age of 6 months :) ), he cried and I thought I'd wasted $70. But the second time (and every time thereafter) he started bouncing in it...and now, after two weeks of daily use, he'll try to bounce as soon as little tushy hits the seat (even if I'm still getting his other leg through the opening)...and with the bounces come a face that is just one big giant lit-up grin. If we look at home WHILE bouncing he will bounce higher and giggle. He's not super interested in all the toys yet but just for the bounces (and being able to put him down in a place that is safe and makes him excited!) it's been worth every penny. Only minor changes I'd  make are 1. Make it easier to move around/store.... (if that's possible without affecting safety/stability) and 2. Add a few rings so that we could add our own toys. Oh and while I'm designing the perfect jumparoo it'd be great if the animal toys (monkey, elephant, bird) would play the appropriate animal sound when the baby interacted with them. But these really are minor quibbles; even as is its already been a great addition to our mini baby store--er, that is, living room. :)<br />If you, like us, have a baby that already seems to like to move and squiggle and be more active, I would HIGHLY recommend this jumparoo.

Neither of them are perfect and I ended up liking this one the least so I sent it to the grandparents for use there.  My son is 8.5 months old now so we have gotten plenty of use out of them.  I love how bouncy this one is however it is supposed to make noise with every jump and it does not.  I assume this is a defect, but there was no way I was going to be able to fit this back in the box due to the large rainbow clicked into the seat so I didnt exchange it.  The leg holes and seat seemed tight on my baby and he isnt even chubby.  The seat is hard for him to spin so that doesnt happen much.  He enjoys spinning the roller and batting at the hanging toys but doesnt care for the others.  If it played music with every jump he might be more entertained by this jumper but I doubt it.  I am still on the search for my favorite jumper and will likely buy something else for baby #2.",2015-01-05

My two month old baby was unreasonably hyper - she hated to be lying down and was always wanting us to hold her upright - so we got this for her and she's loved it since day one. The little lights and music are fun and stimulating and she loves the colorful little jungle animals. When we first bought it she had zero hand-eye coordination; then within two weeks of playing in it she had figured out how to move the little monkey and even turn the elephant all the way around.<br /><br />She is four months old now and she uses it for hours every day. It gives her loads of exercise that we couldn't possibly give her ourselves, and it's portable enough for us to take it into any room that we are in so it allows her to feel like she is part of the action. I'm not exaggerating when i say that she loves it - she even cries if we try to take her out of it before she is done bouncing. It disassembles and reassembles super easily and the three different sides with the rotatable seat ensure that she never gets bored of one activity. It is hilarious to watch her going crazy and bouncing all over the place. The thing I love most about it is that it makes her smile, and that is priceless.",2015-01-06

At first, upon receipt in 2012 the product worked marvelously.  For about a month.  Then we had nothing but problems.  Customer service was horrible.  We finally stopped using.  Then I pulled it back out in 2014 upon the arrival of another baby.  Still didn't work, gave customer service another try.  Finally got it to work- hallelujah!  Then, within a month it completely stopped working again.  Although this time I couldn't even get the thing to turn on.  Again, contacted customer service.  Since I didn't buy &#34;from them&#34; but through Amazon, then I could not get refunded my money.  And conveniently it's out of the warranty period so there's nothing they can do.  If you're willing to spend $300 for 3 months of use then by all means get it.  But if you expect more out of a $300 purchase (like I do) then DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be sorely disappointed.  I, on the other hand, ADORE THE &#34;Baby Monitor 3G&#34; app.  It also has a camera, and uses devices you already have around your house, and NEVER fails.  The ONLY downside to the app is that it doesn't have an infa-red camera to see your child in the dark (I keep my kids rooms pitch black).  Other than that, AMAZING, and I think the app is $8 or something, what is that, like 5% of the cost?

It was much easier to put together then when I first thought it would be when I took it out of the box. Be sure to secure the seat to the hooks and there will be no problem with it coming loose, a problem that some others have stated that they have had.

Unlike other reviewers we've had very few issues with connectivity over Wi-Fi or bluetooth nor have we had issues with stability. We've taken the baby monitor with us on every trip we've taken, both cross country and transatlantic. The camera quality for both day and night is great. We like that we can check the camera and listen to our little ones from either our phones or from our computers. One annoyance is that you have to use your phone to change the music/white noise.<br /><br />All that said, the baby monitor has one huge flaw and that is that the micro USB port is soldered right to the motherboard. It has nothing other than that solder to support it. Each and every time you plug it in it weakens it, until it will eventually break off. It broke off once in our first year of owning it.

More variety in sounds would also be nice.

It has a great, clear picture, even in the dark. The audio is clear and the parent microphone works well also. And lots of other features, more really than seem necessary (to me anyway, husband loves it).<br />The notification settings for room temp/noise/motion seemed like they would be nice, but we found annoying after about a day. Perhaps we could have tweeked the thresholds to be more useful, but we just turned them off, problem solved. The temp notification seemed to go off even when it was reporting within our thresholds though. It just seemed like one of them was constantly chiming on our phones...even when no one was in the nursery and we didn't care.<br />There is a slight delay, sometimes a couple seconds, that you don't get with traditional monitors, but an unlimited range (you can check in from work if you felt so inclined). And it occasionally loses connection, which doesn't restart automatically if the app is not actually open at the time (if you are listening to the audio with the app closed); this is really an issue with the wifi router failing, but something to be aware of if that's what you are relying on.<br />The nightlight and lullaby/white noise features are really nice. The light is very dim; enough to give the baby some light but not so much that it would be distracting or keep them awake. The lullaby feature is great for helping baby sleep (our son goes right out with the ocean sounds); but keep in mind, you'll be listening to it loud and clear also. It's nice that both the light and lullaby have timers (3, 15, and 60 min) or can be turned on and off as needed, and the volume adjusted on the unit or from the app.<br />That said, for me, the only real drawback is that you have to use an app on your phone or tablet to listen/view; I prefer the traditional monitors with a dedicated parent unit. But my husband loves having it on his phone...he would control everything in the house that way if they all had apps, and most of them seem to. It makes it harder to multitask and monitor the baby; for instance if you are on the phone, you can't hear the monitor at the same time (anything that has audio will shut down the monitor's audio). It also drains my phone battery quicker if I leave the non-stop listening feature on. Since we really only put the baby in his room to sleep at night, these haven't been huge issues for me...I can leave my phone on the charger next to me and obviously I'm not using the phone for anything else while I'm sleeping.<br />All in all, we are very pleased with the purchase and the monitor has met our needs.",2015-03-03

We got it for him at Christmas, when he was 4 months old. He wasn't able to jump yet, but still enjoyed being upright and playing with the toys. At about 5 months, he figured out how to jump and just went nuts. He'll play in it so hard that he's actually fallen asleep in it a few times. My only complaint is that it's very hard to spin the seat. At 6 months, he's still unable to spin the seat by himself. He just turns his whole body to reach the toys behind him. My husband also found it a little challenging to get the cloth correctly positioned onto the seat when setting it up. It's also huge! I wouldn't recommend it if you have a small apartment or living room. We actually keep it in our foyer when kiddo isn't in it, so that it's not dominating our living room. If I could change one thing about it, I'd make it portable, somehow, so that we could take it with us to the grandparents, etc, since he loves it so much.

Support from Withings was not shy of saying known issue with advertised functionalities.,"I bought this expensive so called &#34;SMART&#34; baby monitor that can not only show you video of your baby over wifi and usual two way voice but also has humidity and temperature sensor. I anticipated this will help me keep the baby as comfortable as possible over night. Little that I know, first night of use and I realized that temperature and humidity monitor keeps on sending false push notifications randomly and not once or twice but throughout the night (all the time when baby monitor is on) and that keeps making noise.<br /><br />I thought there may be issue with my specific item's sensor circuits and so I reported issues to Withings support and they told me that its known issue with their app and that unfortunately they can not provide any timeline on when it will fixed (if it ever gets fixed). Usually app developers selling their apps on app stores in less then dollars are more responsive when bug is reported with their apps and so I couldn't believe the answer that I got from Withings support. Right now I am stuck with very expensive &#34;SMART&#34; baby monitor that doesn't work as advertised and in fact adds more hassle, hardship on us and baby with those constantly nagging false push notifications. I can always turn off temperature and humidity monitoring functionality and use it as &#34;DUMB&#34; baby monitor but I certainly did not pay so much where as I can get decent baby monitors that works on wifi and has two way audio at a fraction of price (foscam or even dropcam). Hope this review helps in your decision making for new parents out there.",2015-03-11

We use it sparingly (as per doc recommendations) but our little guy just loves it. Initially, he was all about the bounce & lights. After a bit, he started turning to appreciate the two back activity areas - the lizard and the sun. As he's gotten older, he really loves the details and higher level activities. He just figured out how to turn around the elephant and giggles wildly when it spins back around! Now he'll jump to pull at the tree frog & parrot above. It's neat to see him grow into the various phases of this toy ... and that reaffirms it's value since it isn't a cheap investment as far as short-lived baby toys go!<br /><br />We bought this for our little guy when he was just shy of 4 months - but in the 99th % for size. He fit into it great but needed a little help in the height department (we used a folded yoga mat under his legs for this purpose and to cushion his landing a bit). I wouldn't recommend early use of this toy (before 4 months) unless your child is on the larger size, has awesome head control, and can already assisted stand a bit. A LOT of movement is possible here and their still developing spine & muscles might not handle all the rigorous exercise well.<br /><br />The ONLY negative, and it's a small one, is the quality of the plush toys that hand - the parrot & frog. We have the FP musical rainforest mobile that coordinates with this model Jumperoo...it features the same animals. The plush animals on the mobile are a much higher quality. If I didn't have both, I'd never have known the difference. But, since I do have both, I'm left wondering why the cheaped out on this detail if they already had a similar item in production?!? The mobile ones really are much nicer. Not worth taking off a star, though. This thing is awesome!",2015-03-28

We choose this instead of a walker because of not having to worry about him knocking things over or tipping over and falling down. With this Jumperoo, I can keep him in the corner of my eye and worry less about the trouble he can get himself into.",2015-04-04

I did have an issue where the gears went out of place and the actual mobile didn't turn around.

When she could get them to happen.  But the only noisemaker that worked was found at only a single point on a wide turning wheel.  The other two ways to get noises, from bouncing or from twisting the elephant, might as well have not existed:  the amount of strength required to twist the elephant is more than I think any baby will have, and even if she was bouncing around like crazy the motion sensor almost never noticed.<br /><br />And there are only three activity stations:  only one that has anything fun, with the turning wheel that makes lights and noises go off.  The turning globe full of beads is ok, but gets old quick. The button that makes a tiger come up is similarly built for Hercules, and never happened for my child; and the sun above it is also fairly pointless.<br /><br />Also note:  the ability for the baby to turn to new points of interest is very small, since the friction of the rotation is huge.  And it's too tall: my 45% percentile-height child has to stand on a couch cushion at the lowest setting.  And setting it on the highest setting is a huge pain.  And breaking it down to store it in its box in the shed required ridiculous amounts of force to pry the activity stations free.<br /><br />This is a ton of space wasted for one point of interaction.  I did well to replace it with a fake phone that has lights and noises in a package smaller than a shoe.<br /><br />Don't buy this.  Find an older stand-up activity center on Craigslist.

You don't have to put your fingers/hands on the actual pacifier every time you pick it up. Let the little monkey's body handle that part.

We raised 4 kids and I don't know how many pacifiers we lost and had to run out and buy past midnight. What a lifesaver!  You don't even have to clip it onto the baby's clothing. Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !

Throughout the process I interacted with no less than five people, and constantly had to explain the situation over and over.  From my communications with Withings I discerned that the company knows there is a defective manufacturing issue with its units' power port.  Irrelevant of this fact, they would not replace the unit for me because I could not prove the unit was less than a year old- which I could not do because it was gift.  The most they would do is offer me a 25% coupon on my next purchase.

He is 6 months old. No where on the site, packaging or instructions does it indicate any sort of height requirement. They only list a weight max and that they baby must be holding his/her head up.  The instructions say very clearly to set the height to where your baby's toes are touching the ground. No where does it state what to do if they don't touch the ground. Other reviewers seemed to have this same problem and they've place books under the jumper - but who wants to do that?!?!?

Our baby is within the height and weight range recommended for the product, and I set up the product height at the highest level 3 so that our baby's toes very lightly pointedly touch the floor when in a still position just as in the instructions, and this encourages baby to tiptoe while jumping and his toes curl inward when he jumps and lands and the pressure of his body weight and the height momentum from jumping puts unnatural amount of pressure especially into his inwardly curled big toes and it is causing problems in the natural standing stance of my baby.  I noticed that after using this product, my baby stiffly tries to avoid putting weight on his feet as if he cannot flex his foot in his natural standing position and even if I manage to get him to place some of his body weight on his feet, he can only manage to slightly touch the floor with his big toe only as if he cannot naturally stand upright using the whole surface of the bottom of his feet.

I've used classic bottles and hated that third adapter ring for the 9oz classic bottles. I am so glad they got rid of those for the Naturals. These lid caps seal the bottle of the Naturals bottles perfectly. They do not snug in like the old classics but it is also made of a different material that seems able to take the heat of sterilization but I won't be boiling these so I am not sure. But the cap DOES fit in the Naturals bottle, and the actual new packaging says &#34;for classic and natural&#34; so it has been redesigned to be universal. The disc also fits just firmly enough to not leak liquid when the lid is screwed on but not so firmly that it is a pain to remove. I love that this disc stays in the lid when unscrewed for the most part so I am not dropping it on the floor like with the disappointing Nuk bottle adapters.<br />So basically this makes the classic and natural bottle into a storage container without nipple.

There is one toy (bee?) that he can pull up and put in his mouth. He loves the crinkle sound it makes and usually has it in his mouth.

Baby items are expensive and I don't want to purchase new things every couple of weeks. My son has been looking for more activities, but he cannot yet sit up on his own.

He is a little small, but can hold his head upright, which is an absolute must before putting a child in this. Because he is still so short, we put a pillow under his feet so he can jump around. The height can be adjusted as kids get taller too as there are 3 different height settings.<br /><br />While he hasn't yet discovered that the seat can spin around to the various &#34;stations,&#34; he seems to love that no matter which way he turns his head there is something fun to look at and play with. (Until he gets the hang of it, I rotate the seat for him.)<br /><br />I envision my son getting quite a few month's worth of enjoyment out of this so I consider this money well spent.

You can fit 2 normal bottles easily in the main section if needed. With a city select, if you have a seat in the highest position pushing against the organizer, lifting the handle to the highest position will allow you to have more room. The same goes with any other organizer on this stroller. You can also still put your diaper bag on the stroller. I do it all the time with the organizer attached.

The instructions in the box are all written for I-devices.  There was a little insert for Android installation instructions, which read, &#34;Download the app, then follow the on screen instructions&#34;.

Wouldn't boot up any more.  It was still under warranty so I e-mailed Withings fully expecting to hear nothing back.  To my surprise, I got an e-mail back the next day.  After answering some questions for customer support over a few days via e-mail, they decided to send me a new unit!  So about 2 weeks after I contacted them, I had a new baby monitor.  I have to respect a company that honors their warranty even for a discontinued product.  The new one is working great so far (knock on wood). I bumped up my review to 4 stars based on this, and the fact that as I think about it, there still really isn't a product like this out there in the market.  Sure, you can get a little IP cam for less money that mostly does the same thing, but I have tried a couple of those and to be honest the phone interface is not as reliable and nicely executed as the Withings interface.  I am really glad I bought these as they have served me relatively well for 3 babies... I would certainly buy another Withings product in the future as I think they really are pretty innovative.  Original (2-star) Review: This product must have a serious issue with quality control.  I have two of these - one works perfectly, the other is plagued with problems. I bought the first one in 2012 when they were still $300 and it worked (and still does work) perfectly.  I bought a second one 9 months ago (for $250) because we had twins, and something is wrong with the camera lens.  It is like misaligned or something - because the video towards one edge is very distorted.  Also, it frequently loses sound, or the sound randomly becomes very faint, or sometimes I just have to go reset it completely.  Resetting is very tricky - it is some sequence of plugging/unplugging the battery and /or power cord in some order that never works the same way twice... A bit frustrating.  I gave it two stars because one works great (which is why I bought the second one), but the second one has been a disappointment. Also, like others, I never really used the lullaby or light features.  However, one of our twins likes the lullaby music, and it has actually worked to put her back to sleep - a priceless feature if it can do that!",2015-07-11

Looks like it entered some test loop because every time I pushed the reset button the camera would move in a complete circuit (something it never did before).  It is so nice to have a baby monitor to tell you if the kids are sleeping, etc, would be even nicer if it could last more than 2 and a half years.  Even some of the Infrared LED's were burning out.

Amazing!<br /><br />But here's the thing: you want to know when your baby wakes up and starts crying in the night, right?  Seems like a pretty normal, obvious, important thing for a baby monitor to do, right? Maybe even a *requirement* for a baby monitor?<br /><br />The Withings Smart Baby Monitor will not stay connected to your wifi network.  It will disconnect, and it *might* tell you that it disconnected, but it won't automatically reconnect.<br /><br />If I had the power, I would fire every single one of the product team over this one, ludicrously stupid failure.  This is like a 2-lines-of-code fix: JUST MAKE THE DAMN THING AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT.  When it disconnects and we happen to see it, we can just hit the button again and it reconnects.  HOW ABOUT DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY?  Imagine!  What an idea!  Now, it *says* it *tried* to reconnect, but couldn't, and yet: I can make it reconnect just by hitting the switch again.  SO HOW ABOUT DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY?  Please, please, please just put it in a while() loop. I would happily do it for you.  PLEASE.<br /><br />I DREAM of confronting the people at this company: Do you people have brain damage? How did you all get engineering and product management jobs in the first place? Can I just sit down and fix your code FOR YOU?  What mentally disabling drugs did you take to make you release a product so fundamentally, basically flawed that has such a simple solution? Is this company some kind of charity that employs engineers that couldn't get hired anywhere else?  If I interviewed someone who worked on this product I'd beg them to explain, if I didn't order them out of the room immediately.<br /><br />So, if you're listening at all to your customers, Withings, please hear me: JUST MAKE THE APP AUTOMATICALLY RECONNECT.

I decided to try a bouncer for him. The first few times we put him in it, he didn't know what to make of it and just kind of stood there. After about 10 minutes he'd want out. I thought maybe it wasn't for him. Then after a few tries, he just took to it. Once he saw he could jump on his own and noticed the different toys he could play with, he loved it. Now, he plays in it all the time!!! It allows me freedom to do things around the house while he enjoys jumping and playing. He's even fallen asleep in it because he's tired himself out.

I was given the baby monitor M3S as a Baby shower gift in March 2015 (order#5546).<br /><br />As expected, we did not try to use the camera until it was close to the due date, and soon thereafter. It took a lot of time for us to decide on which camera to get, and your had all the features we wanted.<br /><br />I write you today to express my discont with the product, the service provided and the overall experience. This is our last attempt to solve the issue directly with IBaby Labs. We will be contacting the Better Business Bureau, the Local TV station, post online and report to Apple and the credit card company.<br /><br />I would like a refund for the camera as soon as possible so my aunt can give me another one that works.<br /><br />I will list the events that got us here today.<br /><br />1.  Plug and Play: the camera was not as simple to set up, even though that was advertised. I do have all Apple products and took several calls to get it set up. The ‘sharing Wifi’ cycle never concluded. It took several calls to get it started; lots of install and reinstall trials.<br /><br />2.  Internet range: all other devices we have in the house (Ipad, Iphones, Apple TV, Sonos speaker, etc ) work within the wifi range we have with the Apple Router 802.11N (700 sq ft apartment). We were told that the area in which the camera sits has poor connection (through Ookla App suggested by your staff), even though we had already purchased another wifi signal booster that was placed 10 feet away from the camera (originally even hard wired).<br /><br />3.  Internet Connection: after lots of trouble shooting, we were told that the camera does not take 5GH, only 2.5GH. Why weren’t we told that during Support Call #1?<br /><br />4.  Lost Connection: despite all these efforts, we continued getting the ‘reconnecting/lost connection’ message 4 times within the same hour. It is important to mention that, as you know, the camera beeps loudly whenconnection is lost. Do you have kids? You then can imagine baby waking up every time connection is lost.<br /><br />5.  Live Feed: After troubleshooting all the above since mid March, I decided to give it a try with the live feed last month. Baby in crib in her room, camera on, I am away with the Ipad on live feed in my room, trying to sleep at the same time that I was trying the camera out. The Live Feed function has a static noise that prevents anyone from sleeping. Then, I found myself watching the monitor for the 20 minutes that this trial lasted. I kept looking for signals that the camera was indeed with live feed. I then realized that my baby was up, making sounds and moving around and the motion/sound alert had not detected it.<br /><br />All these issues were discussed with the support team. At times they would log the issue, at times they would not (#767, 4260, 4370, 4468). I have logs for my phone indicating at least 45 attempted/completed calls to the support line in the past 4 months. Have I mentioned that I am a new mom, with a newborn at home?<br /><br />Besides the technical issues that indicate that the camera is just not ready to be sold (as confirmed through other online reviews, and other friends experiences as well), we have an even bigger issue with the service provided. As the President and CEO I believe you would care to learn how this entire process has been so far.<br /><br />1.  Jennifer has been short, rude and dismissive every time we call. Never a smile on her voice.<br /><br />2.  Bricio, though very polite, repeats himself over and over again using the same words ‘let me be honest with you’, or ‘just out of curiosity’ but not offering any solutions.<br /><br />3.  Eva was put in the middle of all of this, helpless.<br /><br />4.  We have been trying to talk to a manager for 8 weeks now. None available, ever! No call back after Jennifer/Bricio guaranteed a follow up from management (except when Eva called back, clueless about what she was being involved on).<br /><br />5.  At some point, I was asked to record a video of the issue and submit to Bricio in order for the tech support to validate the problem and be able to send me a replacement camera (to which I would have to pay for shipping to return the defective one first – no trust here?). I recorded some of the video, but lacked memory on my phone to complete it. The email size was also too big and didn’t go through. I then sent an audio file with the static noise. I called the very next day, spoke to Bricio who listened to the audio file while with me on the phone. He then said that he had what he needed to proceed with the exchange. Two weeks went by without any update. I then called back, and he had a vague memory of my case, and tried again to get me to record the issue. I reminded him that I am the customer and I am working harder than they are to fix the problem. And for the record, I am the one with a newborn at home!!!<br /><br />6TToday was the last straw for us: when I asked Bricio to speak with the manager that was supposed to call me yesterday (and for the past many weeks), he politely said no manager was available. Then I asked for his/her name, and he declined sharing that. Then I asked for a phone number or email to that manager, and was declined again. Then I asked for the owner/President/CEO’s name, and he said he could not give me this information either.  Which company is that which prevents that information that is readily available online to be given out?<br /><br />The level of disregard for the complaint is beyond anything I have ever encountered. Very quickly Bricio and Jennifer mentioned the company’s return policy. Interestingly enough, at first when I mentioned I just wanted to return the camera bought through Amazon, they said I had to deal with Amazon. Had I bought directly with them, I could then get a refund. Well, when my aunt (Maria Blackmore) forwarded me the receipt, it showed that it was purchased directly from IBaby. Still, I was denied a refund. Though the policy applies, the mal functioning camera does not seem to be of concern to anyone at Ibaby Labs.<br /><br />I am writing you to make you aware of what is going on with your product and the service IBaby Labs provide. I can’t believe that for less than $200, there have been this many interactions without a solution.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing from you with the refund resolution. At this point, I have to kindly decline Bricio’s offer to send me a replacement.<br /><br />Thank you,",2015-08-13

Instead, I waited until moving the baby to the nursery at 6 months old to really start using it.<br /><br />After less than 7 months of consistent use, the monitor completely stopped working.<br /><br />I contacted Withings via email (since that is the only way to contact them) and since I had purchased it over one year ago, it was considered out of warranty.  They said there was nothing they could do as it was a hardware failure and they offered me a 25% discount on the same product with no indication that the hardware issue was resolved with later versions.  I was shocked to learn that Withings doesn't even offer a repair service for this expensive monitor.<br /><br />If you choose to take your chances with this monitor:<br />1.  Be prepared for connectivity issues as reported in many other reviews (I experienced this problem off and on during the few months of use).<br />2.  Do not expect to be able to easily get in contact with Withings Customer Service.<br />3.  Start using it consistently as soon as you get it to flush out any issues within your first year for the warranty or be prepared to have a $200+ paperweight.<br /><br />In this day and age, with so many other options available, it appalls me that Withings did not attempt to do more to rectify the situation even though it was considered out of warranty.  I suppose that I've been spoiled by companies (like Amazon) with amazing Customer Service practices.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the [[ASIN:B00E1CIGAE Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode]] from Amazon as a fast replacement for this (it is not a video monitor) and have been way more satisfied with it's performance over the past few months than I ever was with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor.",2015-08-13

I also tried to put a pillow on the ground so he could jump on that while in the jumperoo, but it just makes him more frustrated.  Also, he is unable to turn the chair on his own right now and I think this will happen when he gets older.

But they did not allow access away from the home nor did they have apps available on your phone. You had to have seperate baby monitor devices. It's a pain. So I thought I'd give this one a try, and I'm so glad I did. We don't seem to have any issues with the app or connectivity as some other reviews have stated. My husband and I both have the apps installed on our phones and iPads and all seem to work smoothly, almost 100% of the time.<br />The reason I am buying a second, however, is because the device which attaches to the railing of the crib does not fit our crib. Our crib railings are rather thick and the attachment does not stretch far enough to fit around them. Well, last night, my daughter learned how to stand in her crib (yes, we are lowering the mattress tonight!) and knocked the monitor onto the ground. Since the attachment didn't fit, we simply set it on the edge of the crib. Until now, it wasn't an issue. But overall, it's an awesome product and we love it.
