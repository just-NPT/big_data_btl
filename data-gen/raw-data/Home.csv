I have nothing to change in my review.  I am surprised that people are having so many problems with this product.  My unit still works fine; the battery holds a charge; the pole has not broken; the handle has not broken.  Maybe my unit is not typical.  However, you do need to have realistic expectations for this product.  The Swivel Sweeper is not a new revolutionary cleaning apparatus worthy of a patent (as the info commercial implies).  It is just an electric sweeper for quick clean ups.  If you want the thorough results that a vacuum provides--use a vacuum.<br /><br />Original Review<br />I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for two weeks.  If you are looking for something better than your dust pan, this is the product for you.  If you are looking for something to replace your vacuum cleaner, you are going to be disappointed.  The pros: light weight, high quality, cordless, rechargeable, easy to use, maneuverable.  The cons: overpriced, can't ever replace a vacuum, time-consuming periodic cleaning.  The product is just what I was looking for: a cordless, rechargeable, electric dust pan that I could keep in the kitchen next to the refrigerator and pull out twice a week and sweep the kitchen floor.  I have a light colored tile floor and it shows every little particle of dirt.  In addition, my cat spreads Friskies on the floor and the sweeper picks up those nicely.  The Swivel Sweep is a fairly high quality product.  All the parts look well designed, fairly durable (they are just plastic), and fit together well.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweep is oversold on the info commercial (as to be expected).  It will never take the place of a vacuum cleaner.  It is not a vacuum cleaner.  It creates no suction.  It is simply a sweeper.  I would summarize it as an electric dust pan.  The product has four rotating brushes that sweep items into a small centralized dust pan with openings on all four sides.  The Swivel Sweeper is much quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.  It makes a tone with medium-high pitched whine.  The picture on the box shows the product being used to sweep dirt from a carpet after a house plant has been toppled--forget it!  That is not a good use of this product.  Use a real vacuum cleaner for that job.  This product is really only effective on hard surfaces.  A dust pan is not what I would use on a carpet.  Yes, you could pick up small items sitting on the surface of a carpet like paper clips, but realistically, to clean a carpet adequately, one should use a vacuum cleaner with strong suction and a powerful beater brush to separate the carpet strands.  The Swivel Sweeper has neither of these.  The Swivel Sweep is not comparable to a real vacuum cleaner.  The Swivel Sweeper has problems picking up some very small items even on hard surfaces.  Sometimes an item will shoot across the floor instead of going into the dust pan.  I find myself going over the same area multiple times to pick up some items (but no big deal).<br /><br />Because the product is fairly new, it is a bit overpriced.  I think $29 would be more appropriate.  I would expect to see it at Target in a year or two for $19.95.  Emptying the dust pan is easy.  Cleaning the sweeper is not.  The Swivel Sweeper comes with a \\""cleaning tool\\"" which is nothing more than a thread cutter/seam ripper (if you know what that is).  Hair (human hair) gets wound around all four brushes and needs to be periodically cut and vacuumed out.  The manual says \\""on occasion\\"" this cleaning need to be done.  The manual indicates the battery will last 45 minutes on one charge.  That seems reasonable since I am still on the original charge and have used the sweeper about 10 times.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product.ch quieter than a traditional vacuum cleaner; however, one would not use it in a room with a sleeping baby as advertised--it is not that quiet.

I would have given it 4 - 5 stars before it broke but not anymore.  It does a great job of getting up all the visible dirt, hair, debris, etc. from hard surface flooring and floormats.  I have no carpet in my house so I cannot rate it on that.  It's easy enough to use that my 3-year old loves to help out.  The problem is that something in the gearbox must have broken because the motor makes noise but the brushes don't turn.  Because I am still in the 90-day warranty period, I was given the option of sending another $12.99 (handling fee) to have the unit replaced or return it for a refund of the $40 purchase price.  I haven't decided yet.  I've already spent ~$55 with the purchase price and ridiculous $15 S&H.  I'm not so sure I want to spend another $20 ($7 to send it to them and $13 handling charge) to get another one.  It's just a little too cheaply built.

I loved them and even saved parts to keep at least one alive. One is still good for 5 minutes at a time. I gave up on them because even the replacement batteries don't last.  <br />  I bought a Swivel Sweeper. The battery is much better, but the sweeper doesn't pick up larger items. It's great for bits and pieces. I do really like it, though. It's not that noisy and light and maneuverable as can be. <br /> OK, maybe the warrantee might be doomed with this, but I've been using both commercially in a restaurant. The Shark was absolutely great for this application. It would pick up glass, french fries, toothpicks, cigarette butts---anything. The swivel sweeper won't (more bending over!) but it's much better at getting in tight spaces under chairs (without having to move them).  <br />  They are  NOT vacuum cleaners. They don't suck dirt out of the carpet. The swivel sweeper is great for quick fixes and so far I haven't had a problem with it at all(4 months).I just wish they (both shark and swivel sweeper) would make a commercial product that would last. I would be willing to pay more. Maybe someone out there could create one that would combine all the good qualities.  <br />  I think anyone with a restaurant should check out swivel sweeper.

Works pretty much as advertised, although don't expect it to do more than light removal of loose dirt, crumbs, etc.  It's not going to get up pet fur or ground in dirt. Very light weight and easy to carry up and down the stairs.  Works much better on carpet than bare floors.  It will pick up on hard floors but takes a few passes to get all the dirt.  If you have carpeted stairs, you will find it handy to quickly clean up the steps.  The Swivel Sweeper is simply made and has a dirt tray on the bottom that is easy to snap out and dump.  The battery is easily removable and fits into a wall charger for recharge.  It seems like a well designed product, but I can't comment on reliability because I just purchased it. (The warranty is 90 days.) I would it have rated it at maybe four stars if it were a little less expensive, say about  $25.00.

The handle broke the third time it was used.  We followed the directions in the manual, which said to send the sweeper, still on warranty, to Ontel with a check for $12.99 to cover shipping of a replacement.  When no replacement was received within a reasonable time, we called them to find out what was happening.  They could not find the package we sent to them, even though their warehouse manager signed for it. We informed Customer Service of the UPS Tracking Information, with the name of the person who signed for the package at Ontel, the manager of the warehouse. Customer Service said we should stop payment on the original check and send them another check or give them a credit card number in order for them to send us a replacement.  A stop-payment would cost us $30.   <br /> <br />In other words, they would not take responsibility for their mistake.

To replace the battery, the Ontel company charges $15 plus $6 handling/shipping, for a total of $21.  Called the corporate offices and they said that the battery is only supposed to last 3-6 months (actually, mine lasted 3 months).  Hence, to run this stupid contraption, you must be willing to spend an extra $84 a year (4 x $21) just to keep the battery going, and that doesnt even include other parts that need replacement.  Seems to me the company intentionally made a poor quality rechargeable battery so that you'd have to keep replacing it!

I agree on the battery problem. It doesn't last long while using the sweeper, about 15 min. but mine's always worked again after it's been charged. I think people need to know that it works best on carpet that is like indoor-outdoor carpet. We are in the military and are stationed in Okinawa Japan, and usually base housing never has carpet, especially here because it's a tropical island and mold is a serious issue. But we have an apt on base that is newly built and they put carpet down, but it's that kind that is  indoor-outdoor carpet, you know, no padding underneath. They just roll it out and I guess glue it down, but my swivel sweeper works so so so so wonderfully on it because of the type of carpet it is. With carpet like this, where it's real close to the ground, regular vacuums just seem to throw the stuff back at your feet because they can't reach that close to the ground. But because the swivel sweeper works the way it does, it's perfect for our house. I would have given it 5 stars but the cannister doesn't hold much and has to be emptied often but i really don't mind that. It's been a lifesaver to me with the kind of carpet i have.

In reading the owner's manual, there is a warning addressing the battery life: <br /> <br />\\""IMPORTANT: ...When recharging, charge time will vary dependent upon the amount of power left in the battery after its last use.  Recommended recharging time for the battery after completely depleting is 6-8 hours.  Battery may be left in charger for extended periods of time, but do NOT exceed 24 consecutive hours.  Doing so may lead to shortened overall battery life.  It is not necessary to wait until battery power is fully depleted before charging.\\"" <br /> <br />I would be willing to bet that this is the cause of the problem for many of the negative reviewers.

I bought Swivel Sweeper to keep the dark green rug in our dining room free of lint, pet fluff, and crumbs the easily make the rug look unkept. These particals stay on the top of the rug and are easy to sweep up with a brush.  That is all Swivel Sweeper is, moving brushes.  It is not a vacuum cleaner. It is only a powered floor sweeper.  I have had several other sweepers.  This one gets high marks because it removes all the surface particals and is very easy to maneuver.  It's the only sweeper I've owned that does not require moving the dining chairs to get all spaces clean.  Suggest you do as I did and buy an extra battery. That way one is always ready to go.  The batteries have given me no trouble because I remove them from the charger after 24 hours and just rotate to the sweeper.  I use the sweeper twice a day. It runs about five minutes each time. After each cleaning, I pop out the dirt tray and empty.  This is important for effective operation and takes only 30 seconds to do. I bought a second Swivel Sweeper as a gift for my syster, complete with a second battery.  She reports back giving high marks and loves the sweeper.  My family has named ours \\""squirrel-lee\\"" and the kids even like to use it. I have not had problems with the unit, but don't expect it to replace your main vacumm cleaner.

It worked fine for our needs from January until the beginning of August. We only used it moderately, maybe once every two weeks or so. We were very careful to never overcharge the battery and we periodically cleaned the brushes, etc. However, even with the proper preventive maintenance it eventually it began to cut out after a few minutes of use. If you waited for a few seconds you could get it to start again but it would continue to cut out. According to the manual it sounded as if the automatic shut-ff was engaging time after time so I made sure that the sweeper parts etc. were spotless as per the instructions. However, the problem persisted until it stopped working altogether once it was placed on any surface. The thing will still run fine if it's held up off the floor, so if you like 'swivel sweeping' the air then this is the tool for you. I called the Ontel Customer Service department to see if they would stand behind their product. I first spoke with a person named Jesse and then to someone who said she was his supervisor named Carmen. Both told me how sorry they were but that there was nothing that they could do. Then they offered to sell me another one. Oh yeah, I'll run right out and buy another swivel sweeper just as soon as I am finished waxing my Edsel.

I couldn't help but see all the cat hair I had on my carpet (I have a long hair Himalayan who sheds), so I thought I'd test it out after about 9 hours went by. I was a bit concerned when I turned it on thinking, there's no way this is going to get anything out of the carpet! I was wrong, immediately I saw that it does a great job. I was under the impression that it would be pretty quiet, but it's definitely not! Then again, neither are most vacuums anyways. Not only did it get the cat hair off the carpet but it also picked up a lot of other dirt that I could barely see, as well as cat litter around the box! My cat always leaves bits of food on the floor and his food mat, so I also use this to suck it up.  <br /> <br />I have now had this sweeper for nearly a year and it still works great!

Another trick I found is that if you DON'T clean the rollers the dirt won't get thrown out either...there is more gunk to hold it in the sweeper!!!

My parents love to cook and end up generating same amount of garbage on the floor.      Ever since we bought the swivel sweepers, our floors have been decently clean. The sweeper does a decent job, and is extremely light - many times, my kids, as soon as they spill something on the floor, clean the mess by themselves. We also have a extra heavy marble top dining table and moving it to clean was out of question - the sweeper goes under it and cleans the rug thoroughly.      My sweeper came with a bad battery - after 1 use, it would not charge. I called SwivelSweeper support, and a new battery was shipped immediately - no questions asked. The rep was courteous enough to offer me a charger also, but I declined as I believed the problem was with the battery, not charger.      My advise to users is to empty the cup immediately - the cup is small, and when you turn it upside down with a full cup, many times, the contents came out. In addition, I have experienced spillage when I go from hardwood floor to rugs. Moreover, it is hygenic too, to empty it.

After the initial charge, I ran it through some tests like kitty litter (no sweat), pergo and tile floors (A+), and versatility (very nimble and convenient).  <br /> <br />David S's review is perfect and I echo his sentiment of wondering why there are so many bad reviews. This isn't a replacement for a vacuum cleaner and shouldn't be treated as such. You know what? Neither are the Roomba and the Euro-Pro Shark (by the way, the EPS is also a very good product but not as agile as the SS). <br /> <br />David S also makes a good point that I agree with: the SS is oversold on TV. You will need to clean the brushes frequently. In doing so, I was amazed at how much carpet fuzz this gathered. Furthermore, despite it's on-air claims, this is not a vacuum. It is an electric, cordless floor sweeper meant to be used for the quick clean-ups between major vacuumings. <br /> <br />Here are some recommendations to make the most of this: <br /> <br />* When sweeping, move the SS in an 'S-like' fashion -- much like how they mop in the Navy. This will allow the brushes to push/pull/spin at the utmost advantage for cleaning. <br /> <br />* Tape the 'cleaning tool' to the pole so that it's nearby when needed. <br /> <br />* Haven't done so yet, but I hypothesize that spraying Static Guard on the brushes may be advantageous in keeping excess dust and 'knap' off the brushes. <br /> <br />Go ahead and buy it if your curiosity is getting the better of you. Follow the advice and expectations of this and other positive reviews and you'll be pleased.",2007-05-30

The bits of material it picks up stay trapped in the tray that is very easy to remove to empty.  The kitty hair that gets wrapped around the bristles is easy to pull off by grasping it between thumb and forefinger.

I love this product! I've bought several as gifts and everyone loves it (even my \\""hard to buy for\\"" dad). One battery charge lasts quite a long time. I probably charge my battery less than once a month and I use the sweeper almost every day. It really does swivel in every direction making it easy to sweep almost anywhere. Both of my children (ages 5 and 3) enjoy using it as well. My son loves to sweep around the house and then see how much dirt he has picked up. As a mom of little ones and a dog, I love that it sucks up cheerios, goldfish and dogfood with no problem. Living in New England without a mudroom, I've found it also comes in handy for picking up gravel, leaves and other such messes. If you have a short-haired pet like I do it is awesome at picking up pet hair. I'm always amazed at how much dog hair I pick up every day. I don't have any plush carpets in my house so this sweeper works on all of my floor surfaces (tile, linoleum, berber-type carpet). I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because my first one did die after 1 year. However, I'm pretty sure it was user error. If you have a long hair or a long haired pet you do have to make sure to clean the brushes in case there is hair wrapped around them. There is a tool that comes with it to do this and it works pretty well. My hair is long now and I wasn't paying attention to the brushes. I got a lot of hair wrapped around them and the sweeper \\""choked up\\"". I fixed it temporarily, but it died shortly after. As the title of my review states, I did actually get rid of my regular broom (it may be in the garage somewhere) so after a few days of dirty floors I went out and bought another swivel sweeper because it cleans much better than a broom with less effort. Some reviewers have said that their battery stopped charging. I never had this problem, but I have had other rechargable products that have done this. It's a fairly common problem. Overall, if you're looking for an easy way to clean your floors - you'll love this product. Some online merchants will tell you that this sweeper is not sold in stores, but that's not true. You can purchase it at Linens N Things or Bed, Bath and Beyond.

I don't use a standard vacuum or broom and dust pan any longer.  The Swivel Sweeper does everything that I need:  cleaning hardwood and tile floors (it doesn't work on carpets unless there is no nap).  There is nothing like it for cleaning up cat litter that gets out of the cat box.  I used to use a mini vac for this purpose, but Swivel Sweeper cleans effortlessly.    The 360-degree rotating head gets virtually anywhere.  The handle can be 90 degrees vertical to 0 degrees horizontal (e.g., for getting under beds effortlessly).  The sweeper gets right up to walls and even in corners.  It gets behind toilets and all the other places that a regular vacuum would be too big for.  The Swivel Sweeper is light and effortless.    Putting the Swivel Sweeper together out of the box is simplicity itself.  Snap a few parts into place and voila!  It takes about 60 seconds.  The rechargeable battery lasts almost an hour and recharges fully in about 8 hours with the supplied charger (not rechargeable batteries to buy).  You don't have to worry about finding outlets to plug into and dragging that inconvenient vacuum AC cord everywhere you go.    The Swivel Sweeper comes with a little tool that you can use to pick threads and such like out of the brushes if you need to.  In normal use, if you avoid carpets, you shouldn't even have to do this.  I would not recommend avoiding using the Swivel Sweeper on wet debris (like wet cat litter).  This can get on the brushes and cake things up.  As long as you keep to dry clean-up, you shouldn't have any problem at all.    I can't recommend this product highly enough.  There is just nothing like it for easily and quickly cleaning up on any surface except carpets.  It easily cleans in places that no vacuum would ever get to.    UPDATE.  I have found that the manufacturing of these swivel sweepers is unreliable.  I had one Swivel Sweeper, which worked fine for a couple of years.  Then the motor started cutting in and out.  I ordered another, and it suffered the same problem after two months.  Unfortunately, AsSeenOnTVGuys does not replace defective products after 15 days, so if you get a defective one, you will not be able to get a free replacement.    UPDATE.  I have purchased three of these swivel sweepers now.  The rechargeable battery seems to be a weak point.  I have had them lose power anywhere from a month to a year, after which the recharge works only for a couple of minutes.",2007-12-22

We rent and this house has carpet in every room, including the dining room and kitchen.  Until I got my Swivel Sweeper, I had to lug my vacuum out every day, sometimes multiple times each day.  Otherwise, food and craft items would get ground into the carpet and I'd have to shampoo it frequently.  It was a real pain.    My mom gave me the Swivel Sweeper nearly two months ago after she got the buy-one-get-one deal from the infomercial.  I have to tell you that I am in love with this thing.  When she first gave it to me I thanked her but truly expected it to be a piece of junk that wouldn't pick anything up.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Cereal, raisins, bits of construction paper, wiggly eyes; it picks it all up beautifully and no longer do I have to lug out my vacuum every day.      It's for quick clean-ups and I have not had any problem with the battery running out quickly.  I usually get multiple trips through the dining room and kitchen before having to charge the battery.  The catch tray pops out for easy dumping and easy checking for things you don't want to throw away (like the wiggle eyes and my daughter's tiny Pony World pieces).  I like that it comes with a tool to rip hair and string off the rollbars with.  Every vacuum should come with such a tool.  It's really just a seam ripper; you can get one at any sewing store, but it is convenient that it actually comes with one and, quite frankly, I hadn't thought about using one for this purpose previously.    I find the Swivel Sweeper to be sturdy and reliable.  My kids love to use it when they clean their rooms, as well, and they aren't exactly kind to it.  They bump it into beds and walls and it's still working fine and still unbroken.  I would certainly recommend this to any parent.",2007-12-31

Our apartment is basically all hardwood floors and it was a pain to get out the vacuum, find places to plug it in and do the whole place with the suction tube--so we saw the swivel sweeper on TV and it looked like just what we needed. We found it cheap at the drug store and bought it there.    Overall, we're very happy with the purchase. Nothing has broken on it and we use it almost every other day. It's very light and quick to use whenever you see dirt or dust on the floor. On the hard floors, it works very well--even on the grout on the tiles for the most part. On the rugs however, it's not so good. Clearly the speed/power drops significantly when it's on anything other than a hard surface. It barely gets the job done and really kills the battery. We still use our vacuum on the rugs. And on the topic of the battery, we charge it overnight once every week and a half or so. We can vacuum our whole apartment (hardwood floors) 3-4 times on a charge (800 sq. ft.).     It's really easy to get under furniture and around table/bed legs with its swivel action, like it shows on TV. It does get in corners pretty well too, and picks things up in any direction. In the TV ad it says that it's quiet.. It's definitely NOT quiet. They clearly block out a lot of its noise in the ad and to use it around a sleeping baby is a joke. If that's your big selling point, don't buy it.    I highly recommend this product for people with lots of hard floors, who just want to keep the floor tidy all the time with a quick and simple sweeper. It's not going to do deep cleaning, but it's much easier than a broom or vacuum for all those in-between dirt and messes on the floor.",2008-01-06

I have had no problems with it or the batteries. I find it to be very convenient to use. I have read extensively about the problems that others have had so I was wary about getting one.     I bought my sister one for Christmas and she loves it.    It's great on wood floors and ceramic tile. I don't think it would be as effective on rugs - since it is just a sweeper - not a vacuum, and the load on the motor due to the drag on the carpet would likely discharge the battery pack very quickly.    In regard to the battery issues, the Company appears to have a quality control problem since they probably use the cheapest NiMH batteries available to maximize their margins. So, it could be hit or miss - you get a good set of batteries in the pack or you don't. There are six C batteries in the battery pack (which can't be opened) - if they are not matched properly, the pack won't last because the higher voltage batteries will discharge into the lower voltage batteries.    Also, the battery charger is not microprocessor controlled which gives the capability to monitor the battery temperature and voltage and thus control the rate of charge to minimize battery temperature. The charger only charges at a constant rate instead of switching to a trickle charge when the charge nears completion to reduce the battery temperature which preserves battery life. Heat is worst enemy for batteries. This is why you shouldn't keep the battery pack in the charger for more than 5 or 6 hours (less time if the battery wasn't completely discharged).    Also, remove the battery pack physically from the charger when not charging - otherwise the charger will discharge the battery.    It would have been nice if the Company gave the provision to replace the C batteries in the battery pack. In that way, a higher quality battery could be purchased from other sources.    It would have also been nice if the Company provided an option to purchase one of those microprocessor controlled fast chargers that charge the battery in two hours and then go into trickle charge to keep the battery topped off - then one wouldn't have to worry about overcharging. You can purchase these chargers for about $10.    When my battery pack fails, I will likely cut open the pack (which is not easy to do) and replace the batteries with high quality C NiMH which you can find readily in Radio Shack or on the Web (e.g., greenbatteries.com).  And, maybe even adapt the battery charger to a microprocessor based fast charger.    All in all, the product is a good idea and works fairly well for the price. But, I feel that there should be other options that allow the customer to buy up so to speak.    Note, you are better off buying the Swivel Sweeper from the many dealers on ebay - it's cheaper ($25) - that's what I did.",2008-01-12

Used this product for about three months and _loved_ it. I have hardwood floors and the regular vacuum I brought along from my old, carpeted apartment has wheels that do my floor no good and also doesn't really work well on the floor. So the Swivel Sweeper was great, until it stopped working. I cleaned all the dirt, hair and dust from the brushes, which was a task in itself as they cannot be removed for cleaning, and it still wouldn't work.    I know all about rechargeable batteries and have been making sure to let it go for _no more_ than 10 hours, going out of my way to make it 6-8. 2 more than the required about isn't much of a margin for a product I've been using infrequently. I spent 25-30 minutes on hold waiting for a customer service representative who spoke down to me and had the most incredulous, apathetic and unconcerned attitude I've encountered from any help line. Unless you're a stay at home person who makes a point of keeping timers next to their chargers, avoid this product.

Early on, I did have problems with the tabs to release the cover, but a little careful use of sandpaper cured this problem, immediately.    Please, do NOT expect this to be a vacuum. It does a reputable job of  sweeping up most things, even sloppy dropped food around the table. As it has aged, it is however, more challenged with fine hair or lint, and likes to spit it out, likely due to wear. I should note, I have no pets, but use this sweeper at least TWICE per day.    I have not had occasion to contact the company, so I cannot speak to negative feedback on that topic. Compared to the Shark and its competitors, and the Bissell Cordless, I believe that despite its kind of cheap construction, it is a better product at actually sweeping than those units, and in many areas, can be purchased cheaper.    Battery maintenance is critical, and it is imperative that it be run down to a virtual stop, before recharging.  Again, no problems here, either, with a solid 6 hour recharge.    I paid $35.00 at Target for mine, and provided your expectations are moderate, this thing is pretty amazing for what it is. I suggest trying one out from a place like Target, saving your box and receipt. Stores like them  have a no questions asked return policy.

It takes me about 10 minutes to go through my house, and it always leaves it looks clean and inviting.  It's certainly much easier than lugging out my Dyson and more effective at getting into those hard to reach places.  There's no bags to buy and cleaning out the unit is a breeze.  However, you do need to clean out the brushes every couple of uses.  The battery keeps its charge for 3-4 uses.<br /><br />This is not meant to be your primary vacuum unless you're in s small apartment with wood floors...

The swivel sweeper is basically a broom and dustpan put together in one nice package. It works wonderfully on my laminate floors and it also works on the area rugs that we have. I would not recommend that it replace your vacuum, as it does not have any actual suction power. But it is a great product, much better than the Swiffer models, this one does not need to be plugged in to charge and it holds a charge for a much longer time, I can clean the entire house (all laminate flooring throughout) with one charge (plus, it will pick up some things on your area rugs whereas the Swiffer model does not).    As a mother of 3 boys I can attest that it is super easy to use and durable.  My 6 year old loves helping me with the chores and it lasted for a year before my 2 year old ripped the wire out of the battery pack (something that only my child would be able to do).     I have other neighbors and friends that have had their swivel sweeper for 2-3 years with the only problem of needing to replace the battery as they left it charging for more than the manufacture recommended 24 hours.

The idea sounded great as I have 2 young kids, 2 large dogs and a cat. My house, with the exception of my bedroom, is all hardwood or marble and I hate dragging out the vacuume every day- so I don't.  Sweeping just seems to be a waste of time stirring up fur and dust.  I need something like this for daily dirt removal. If this was made well, it would be perfect.  As stated, it is not a vacuume, but a sweeper and is supposed to perform as such.  The problem I have is, like everyone else, my battery function is poor.  My mom bought me a new battery, so I have 2 poor performing batteries.  I am sure I must have left them charging longer than instructed, but who has time to figure out how much charge they need and remove them promptly from the charger when they are fully charged?  The batteries function slowly, pulsate, or just turn off after a few minutes.  The second problem I have is the hair cleanup.  Strings, hair and easter grass :) need to be removed every cleaning or so.  Not an easy process with the stitch remover they give you as a cleanup tool.  It takes so long, it negates the benefits of using the stupid thing.  The design is aweful, cheap and so not worth the price... but I still use the stupid thing daily as I have no better option.

There are many styles of flower that are completely different than I have ever seen.  However, as an experienced quiller I do not think this book will be very helpful for beginning quillers.

In addition, some of the lengths she says to use for certain designs seem very suspect.  In some cases short lengths are used (according to her instructions) but the picture shows an item clearly made from a much longer strip.  In addition she mentions widths of paper which I have never seen here (3/16\\"", 9/32\\"", and 5/16\\"").  Finally, her names of the colours of the strips in her book are names which I have never seen here.

The four brushes and swivel head give amazing versatility, and it is easy to get into corners and narrow places.  For the kitchen and bathrooms, it beats my Roomba in noise and speed and with very little effort from me.  In fact, I plan to buy a second one, so that I have one both upstairs and downstairs.

US,49524801,R1UZM808PL0GSH,B001EW5FIK,516287000,Deviant Moon Tarot by Patrick Valenza,Home,5.0,7.0,7.0,N,N,"A Deck With Sumptuous Textures, Masterful Artistry and Utter Originality","&#34;While the physical deck has taken over three years to complete, from an inspirational standpoint, Deviant Moon Tarot has been at least thirty years in the making. It is not only a testament to my art, but a record of my life.&#34; - Patrick Valenza, from the LWB (Little White Book)<br /><br />I've seen hundreds of Tarot decks over the years, and I can honestly say there is nothing on the market that rivals the sumptuous textures, masterful artistry and utter originality of the Deviant Moon Tarot.<br /><br />For months now, several images of the Deviant Moon Tarot were posted to the web, capturing the imagination of Tarot enthusiasts worldwide. Many were clamoring for news, more card images and a definitive release date with an almost desperate excitement.<br /><br />Tarot fans, rejoice! U.S. Games has now unleashed the highly anticipated Deviant Moon Tarot upon the world! And let me tell you, if the exquisite, highly-detailed online images whetted your appetite, the actual deck goes above and beyond expectation! (After my deck arrived in the mail, I was almost shaking trying to unwrap the cellophane.)<br /><br />As Patrick revealed in my interview with him a few months ago, he created each image made by manipulating digital photographs taken of 18th century tombstones. He noted:<br /><br />&#34;I would explore cemeteries and abandoned buildings, taking many photos of textures or objects of interest to blend into my drawings. Rotted doors and windows became buildings and structures, while tombstones parts were fabricated into clothes, accessories, or even the citizens themselves. I like to think the photos contain some of the `spirit' found in the places I have visited, and that perhaps some of their energy will reflect in the cards I have made.&#34;<br /><br />As you can tell, the Deviant Moon Tarot blows me away. One of the reasons is Patrick's ornate and captivating rendering of the Aces. In most Tarot decks, the Aces are relegated to a singular suit symbol with minimal artistry; however, in the Deviant Moon Tarot, the Aces are lavishly illustrated.<br /><br />Replete with arresting beings with unusual bodies, moonlike faces combine with anatomy reptilian, humanoid, mechanic and alien. The King of Pentacles wears a crown of smoking black industrial chimneys while the King of Wands shepherds playful children with tree-like heads.<br /><br />In the amusing Five of Cups, a nagging wife reams out her husband for presumably spilling three of the cups while her hen-pecked husband holds his ears against her shrillness. In the Five of Pentacles card, a milky three-fingered and toed creature with pendulous, pointed silver-tipped breasts creeps around a building housing a giant peering eye. (According to the LWB, she is a woman of ill repute).<br /><br />The Deviant Moon expands on Rider-Waite imagery with a gloriously twisted perspective, reflecting common associations in dazzling patterns, striking colors, and surprising juxtapositions (e.g. a tree that bleeds red, a Page that has created himself out of spare parts and a sharp-dressed masked armless woman with a wheel for a left &#34;foot&#34;). The 9 of Cups, usually deemed the &#34;Wish Card&#34;, aptly depicts a genie who's just emerged from a child's magic lamp.<br /><br />Surprisingly illuminating, the 41-page LWB provides upright and reversed meanings as well as a brief commentary on each card (which is especially helpful for some of the puzzling depictions). Some of the meanings I hadn't heard before, such as the 5 of Wands indicating &#34;conflict with neighbors&#34;, the 8 of Swords can pointing towards censorship and the 5 of Cups revealing marital strife.<br /><br />The slick, glossy cards measure approximately 5 ¼ x 2 ¾ inches with a rather muted moon motif in earth tones comprising the reversible backings. This Premier Edition of the Deviant Moon Tarot also comes with a custom 17 x 20 inch spread sheet with Patrick's comprehensive 10-card Lunatic Spread.<br /><br/>I knew I'd love the deck when I got it, but I had reservations if such a bizarre yet stunning offering would &#34;read&#34; well. I'm pleased to report that not only is the Deviant Moon Tarot a solid reading deck, but also unexpectedly insightful. Even when I first began looking at the cards, phrases would pop into my head describing possible meanings for what I saw.<br /><br />So despite the unusual characters populating the world of the Deviant Moon, they still speak messages relevant and purposeful to discerning individuals. This would make a great journaling deck, too, as well as one for comparative Tarot studies.<br /><br />Art deck aficionados will want to have the Deviant Moon Tarot for their collection as well as those in the market for a decidedly offbeat deck. As reluctant as I am to say it, I don't think this deck will appeal to *everyone* nor would it necessarily be a good first deck for those wanting to devote themselves to studying the Tarot. However, the Deviant Moon Tarot contains amazing gifts for the beholder and the LWB is better than most for explaining card meanings.<br /><br />Patrick Valenza's illustrations are so magnificently dramatic and unique that I hope U.S. Games comes out with a coffee book version of this deck, as well as an array of related giftware and art prints. I know that I'd definitely be in line for all things Deviant Moon!<br /><br />(To see 16 images from this deck, visit the Reviews--Decks section at JanetBoyer.com)<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Bookd&#34; well.

My 6 and 8 year old children are the first to volunteer to sweep the kitchen floor and clean up their messes when they dump popcorn, crush chips on the floor, or whatever. I always had to take care of those messes before because my kids have no concept of how to sweep dirt into piles, or get it into a dust pan. I love how it recharges because they can run it all they want without using electricity or running down batteries. Over the almost two years I have had it I have noticed that the battery life is somewhat less than it was, but it still runs on fairly heavy use for a couple of days before I have to recharge.

If the charge time is rated at 6-8hours that makes the capacity at something around 1500mAH. Not exactly the highest capacity batteries available.<br />- Also, the 200mA charger isn't a \\""smart\\"" charger, it doesn't automatically turn off when the batteries are charged (hence the warning in the manuals that the batteries shouldn't be left on the charger for 24hrs or more)<br />- While it does an excellent job on hardwood, the Swivel Sweeper is nearly worthless on carpeted areas.<br /><br />*** Conclusion ***<br />If you're a pet owner and have hardwood floors then you're likely familiar with the \\""tumbleweeds\\"" of fur that no matter how often you vacuum or use the brush for, they just keep showing back up (ahhh, what a joy being a pet owner can be sometimes huh?).<br /><br />Especially frustrating is trying to keep up with cleaning the areas under the furniture, on the stairs and in the corners. Our Dyson vacuum has great suction, but it's a hassle for doing light work or getting at stuff under the furniture. The broom is good for getting into corners but then you're always bending down to scoop up the dirt, which the dustbin never fully is able to pick up all the fine dirt. Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.<br /><br />We've also tried the hybrid broom/vacuum, but it was essentially the worst of both worlds. It was inept at getting under furniture and the suction power was weak.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper turned out to be fantastic (on hardwood). There's no suction to it, instead, the rotation of the brushes pulls all the dust/dirt/hair into the collection chamber. Kind of like why you'd want mud flaps on your car because while the wheels are turning all the mud, snow, rocks and such are kicked up against the car body.<br /><br />Along with the \\""kick-up\\"" collection method, the swivel head allows for the sweeper to literally be used at a 180degree angle. Which makes getting under furniture an absolutely menial task and you can get the sweeper as far under furniture as you can reach your arm!<br /><br />I should stress again that this is all on hardwood, the couple of times I tried using the sweeper on carpet the brushes could never spin up to full speed so the \\""kick-up\\"" power was diminished and since the brushes had to work that much harder, the battery doesn't last nearly as long.<br /><br />If you have hardwood floors and especially if you have pets that produce fur tumbleweeds like we do, then I wholeheartedly suggest this Swivel Sweeper!Not to mention it's no good at getting under the furniture.

I am not one to read directions, but I happened across someone who mentioned a line of the directions when I was reading reviews for the sweeper.  Seeing as how so many people are still giving negative reviews, I thought it worth reposting.<br /><br />You cannot charge the battery for more than 24 hours consecutively.  Plug it in, and unplug it after a day.  My sweeper has worked great for over 2 years with heavy use.  I don't know why this makes a difference, but the people who follow these instructions have not had any issues and love their sweeper.  Of course, you would never know this if you don't read all of the instructions.<br /><br />The swivel sweeper is not a vacuum.  It's an electric broom.  It's not meant to take the place of a vacuum... it's good for cleaning up debris before you clean the floor (like a broom!).  I've even used it to clean hair off the kitchen floor after at-home haircuts.  One swipe and the mess is gone.  It's awesome at sweeping up Christmas tree needles and crumbly messes.

We live in an apartment and use this every day for quick cleaning.  For this, it's incredible.  It picks up items quickly, rarely needs cleaning, and makes going over everything with a vacuum unnecessary except for big cleaning days.  I've had no technical problems with it at all.  I cleaned out the brushes for the first time in six months of use, and even then it was working fine before I did it.  At times, yes, it did push around some of the dirt, but since it swivels, all I do is turn the handle and the header moves around in a circle, catching whatever problem I may have.  Occasionally there may be a few heavier pieces here and there in a corner that I can't get with it, but it does its job just fine.  I spot clean with it all over the place, perfect for when people drop by unexpectedly and there may be some crumbs lying about.  I really don't have any problems with this item at all.

The majority of the messes experienced in most households are small in size, but frequent in number. This is precisely why the Swivel Sweeper is so useful. It tackles small jobs with ease and it packs a greater punch than most other vacuums of similar size.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper offers many reasons to recommend it, but the main reason this vacuum is superior to others is its cleaning head. It features brushes on all sides. Even large, heavy duty vacuum cleaners do not have brushes on every side of the vacuum head. Swivel Sweeper has them everywhere and they rotate a full 360 degrees. Thus, no matter how you turn the head, the crumbs and other waste will get sucked into the vacuum. There is no second effort needed.<br /><br />Since the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is intended for smaller jobs and since it isn't very large, it obviously doesn't have much storage space for the dust and other particles it picks up from the floor. This means it requires more frequent emptying of the waste container. It is a pretty easy process, given that the receptacle is hinged. All you do is push the inner red tabs to dump the contents. Once the contents are emptied, you just snap it shut and the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is ready for its next use. This will have to be done frequently because the container is so small, but at least the process is simple and doesn't require purchasing disposable bags.<br /><br />The Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is great for cleaning up messes on tile or hardwood floors, but I have noticed that its use is limited on carpets. Even on a very flat carpet, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner seems to be doing all it can to operate, and you will quickly notice a deepening and slowing in the sound as the brushes spin their wheels, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs. The vacuum becomes a tad lethargic on carpets and has limited usefulness in this capacity. The power will be lost more quickly and a single charge will not last very long. One thing you should not use the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner on is shag carpeting. Very few people go shag nowadays, but if you are one of the few who owns shag, do not use this vacuum on your carpet. It will not be able to dig deeply enough to clean the carpet the way it should be cleaned.<br /><br />One nice safety device with the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is its auto- shutoff. If you attempt to pick up something that is too large or too stringy and it causes the brushes to stop turning, the vacuum will automatically shut off. This is good, because it means the motor will not burn out and the charge will not be exhausted too quickly. I have had this experience when I tried to pick up some string. It was longer than I estimated and it got stuck. I had to pull the string out manually, but the vacuum stopped immediately, so there was no damage done to the motor.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is a very good little vacuum cleaner that offers greater capabilities than other sweepers of its size and style. It can't replace the large, more powerful vacuum cleaners, but it wasn't intended for large scale use. It is intended for small jobs and among the vacuums in its class, it ranks as one of the best around.s, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs.

For years, I had been using a similar product (Shark cordless sweeper, Europro cordless sweeper) which I liked very much.  When the battery on the other one died, I decided to try this one. By comparison I find this one seriously lacking.    Price: With a current retail price around $35, the price is excellent. In full disclosure, the product I liked much better was quite a bit higher, but I would still recommend the other one.    Effectiveness: Marginal. This product simply does not pick up everything in one or even multiple passes. I've tried it on both sealed hardwood and ceramic tile. In both cases it picked up most but not all of the dirt and debris, leaving little bits behind here and there. I'm not talking about large or heavy or unusual items here. I mean it picked up some dirt and skipped right over other bits of dirt. It seemed no matter how many times I ran it back and forth in all kinds of directions, I never got a totally clean floor.  While it is picking up some debris, it seems to push or blow other debris out of its path making it next to impossible to get everything.  By comparison the more expensive product has edge cleaning brushes which reach out and grab debris in front of and beside the unit. This one does not have that feature.    Ergonomics and Design: Serious design problems.       1. The dirt cup is very shallow and quite small. It does not hold very much. You will need to dump this frequently to keep the unit working, especially if you are picking up things like pet hair, dust bunnies, the occasional autumn leaf tracked in, etc.       2. The design makes it difficult to remove and dump the dirt cup without spilling it. Picture this. You've got this 6ft or so handle that will readily 'fall' down if you hold the sweeper base w/o supporting the handle. To release the dirt cup you need to use your thumb and forefinger of one hand to pinch the release mechanism on the sweeper base while simultaneously supporting the dirt cup with the other hand; otherwise, the dirt cup will drop to the floor. Because you cannot possibly support the handle while doing so, it will 'fall' clumsily downward.  Now you are still holding the sweeper base by the release mechanism between thumb and forefinger on one hand while the handle dangles awkwardly behind you. In the other hand you have the dirt cup which needs to be emptied. If it is at all full, with dust bunnies and such, a bit of dirt and debris will likely spill over the sides while you are trying to get it to the trash can to dump it.  Then you have to start over.       3. It is equally difficult to put the dirt cup back after dumping it. The dirt cup fits under the bottom. It has to be lined up properly to snap into place, but you cannot see what you are doing under there unless you turn the cleaner and dirt cup upside down - which will likely result in more dust and debris on the floor. You can put the dirt cup back while holding the unit upright and without seeing what you are doing, but it is a bit awkward until you get the hand of it. The cup will only fit in one direction. While holding things upright you cannot see which way it needs to go or how things are lining up. In my opinion, not the best design.  My other unit had a cup that slid in from the side, a much better design.       4. The handle will not stand upright without support. This makes the unit very awkward to work with. You can't just leave the unit standing while you walk away for something, and if you try to lean it agains the wall it will likely slide/fall down.If you buy this, expect to spend a lot of time bending down to pick the handle up off the floor. You will get a great workout.       5. I did not find the sliders to be an asset. My other unit had traditional wheels and worked great. Not only did the sliders not enhance the efficiency of the product, but I was inclined to worry that they might contribute to scratching the hardwood floors bypushing sand, dirt, debris across the floor.       6. Does not work at all well on carpet, not even low pile, indoor/outdoor types. In all fairness the item is not advertised for use on carpet; however, my other unit worked very well on carpet. This one 'sticks' or hangs up on the carpet, and with the easily bendable handle it can be impossible to push across the carpet. Since I have a mix of hardwood, tile, ceramic tile, carpet, and wool rugs, I find it cumbersome to have to use another method for the carpet and rugs.    Summary:  I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to anyone unless they just couldn't afford anything else.  If you are looking for a cordless sweeper I would recommend something similar to the Shark Cordless Sweeper. There may well be other brands that work as well or better. The Shark (and Europro) is the only other one I have tried. By comparison, I would definitely recommend the Shark over this product.    Pros: Excellent price. You can afford to try it. Even if you don't like it you haven't lost a lot of money.  Cons: Poor pickup, must be emptied often, awkward to work with, doesn't work on carpet, sliders add little value and are primarily hype.",2009-01-04

Her projects take you step by step through each section in clear and easy to understand directions to a finished piece that you wouldn't mind giving as a gift or framing for your own wall. There is a gallery of quilling in the back of the book that shows pieces I would never have believed were made from paper except that now I know how to do them myself from reading her book. I am working on a project now that uses 6 new techniques that I have never found in any other quilling book.

Though not unlike others of the genre, The Art of Paper Quilling includes a goodly amount of information on the topic including: history of the art, discussion of paper types, list of equipment and its purpose, important supplies, and additional non-quilling techniques.  She does not cover preservative methods other than that designs may be mounted and framed, nor does she--or anyone else--suggest any clever methods of getting a quilled gift card safely through the postal system.<br /><br />The author provides, not only photographed collections of shapes but, a detailed written description of the techniques required to render them.  Her designs show a pronounced sense of color and texture, and while she presents some designs specific to special occasions, the overall collection is definitely directed to a general audience and a multiplicity of purposes.<br /><br />Most of the quilling techniques are illustrated in one or more of the author's projects, which allows the student to practice them, and there are projects at all levels of experience, so that the more advanced student will also find a challenge.  Patterns and templates are found at the back of the book for the student's use, and they include patterns for a sachet package and for boxes of heart, oval and square shapes.<br /><br />Although there were some designs I felt were a little awkward (place cards on p. 107 and 109) or lacked something (as the greeting card on p. 58), I found most of her work stunning.  I was particularly impressed with the display of butterflies introducing the gallery photos, and may try some of them myself.  I really, really loved the boxes--I'm crazy about boxes anyway--and will definitely try some of them.

The plastic is so thin that the plastic cover broke the first week (I was pretty careful.)    The battery charged for enough time to finish cleaning our kitchen and I was satisfied with what it picked up. However, if you swivel it (and that's what it is known for), it often flips over - especially on stairs. If it flips over or comes off the ground or even tilts at all, the dirt in the cup comes spewing out and you need a heavy duty vacuum to clean it up. Sounds like this wouldn't happen often but it does.  After using it every day for a few months, it just died.  I had a Bissel version of this and that one didn't last long either.  These things are cheap but I hate that we are putting them in landfills and that I'm paying for a new one every few months.

If you leave the battery on the charger too long it KILLS the batery. I was very careful witht eh first battery and it only lasted me 1 year. My second battery is barely holding on to life - it will work for maybe 20 seconds before dying.

It worked great - I thought it was the best thing I'd ever purchased - it is great for going into small areas I can't get a normal vacuum, and I don't have to bother with cords.  I have a small 2 bedroom house with all hardwood floors and tile, so it was pretty much all I needed to sweep up the floors each week.  I liked it so well I even bought one for my parents for Christmas.  You do have to be careful to pick up any string or power cords, or drape cords because it will pick them up and they will get lodged in there easily.    However, 2 weeks ago, the product stopped running after only partially finishing the house - before that I could clean my house at least once on a battery charge.  I did leave the battery charging a little too long one time and I thought that was the problem.  I ordered a brand new battery - thinking with a spare I'd have plenty of power to finish the house, even if I'd shortened the life of the first battery.  I charged the new battery. I started with the old, and that ran about 7 minutes and the sweeper stopped, and I put the new charged battery in. It ran for a couple minutes and quit.  I emptied it and cleaned out hair from the bottom and could run it again for 30 seconds and it would stop again. The bottom felt hot.  It's not under warranty anymore so I decided since it was not working to take it apart and see if there was any way I could clean it better. It was pretty easy - there are several screws on the bottom that are visible, and 4 more that are under the 4 white plastic balls on the bottom. I carefully (keeping track of the order of the parts and how they went together) took apart the brushes and gears and cleaned out hair and a thread that was stuck in the gears and reassembled it so things moved freely.  It appears to work just like new on the same battery charge that was running out 30 minutes earlier.  It even did the carpets in my house that I had not tried for awhile.  My guess is that it was overheating because the hair and thread were stuck in the gears and making the machine have to work hard to turn the gears and causing it to overheat before the battery was dead.  I will know next time when I use it to clean the whole house if I have fixed it - that it was not just a case of allowing it time to cool down.  It was a fairly simple to do what I did - not hard to disassemble and reassemble if you paid attention to where the parts go. I would not try this if the warranty was still valid, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I did take the battery out first to be safe. If for some reason I still have trouble next time and it ends up just being a bad part, I will post a comment - but I mainly wanted to say that you may think the battery may be your problem if it stops but it may not be.  Let it cool down for a half hour and try it again on the same battery and see if it runs for while and that will tell you if the battery may be bad. I figure it is one of two things - the hair etc. was making it work extra hard and overheat (that is what I suspect) - or just stopping it from turning, or a just a bad part in there that is overheating - we will see.  I did not do a good job of cleaning it out regularly and I will now.  I thought this info might be helpful to someone. It's worth a try before throwing it away or spending alot to fix or replace parts.",2009-02-22

Most of its projects use 1/8\\"" (3 mm)-wide strips, but the one I wanted to try right away, \\""A Blue Cornflower and Daisy Arrangement\\"" involved cut-out and fringed petals, plus a fringed center using ¼\\"" (6 mm)-wide strips.  A fringing tool would be very useful for many of this book's projects, if you don't want the tedium of fringing strips by hand.<br /><br />The patterns in this guide vary from 60% of actual size to full-size.  (I wish authors would stick to full-size patterns, but I suppose this isn't always possible).  They range from simple to complex, but even the complex designs consist of a few varieties of paper coils, repeated many times.  Most of the projects involve flowers and/or butterflies, but there are also a few Christmas designs and a pair of Easter bunnies.  The finished quillwork is used to decorate picture frames, plaques, boxes, greeting cards, and gift bags (sachets).<br /><br />Colored photographs decorate this 128-page craft book, including a gallery of paper quilling art by Claire Sun-ok Choi in its final pages.

As with anything, I found both positive and negative reviews, ultimately deciding I needed to try it for myself. I have decided that there is a very simple bottom line when it comes to this product: it is not a vacuum cleaner nor is it advertised as such. BUT it does what it is meant to do well, and that is effectively picks up dirt, dust bunnies, pet hair and other smaller particles quickly and easily.     Will the Swivel Sweeper replace your vacuum cleaner? No. Will it make your carpets look as good as they do after a thorough vacuuming? No. Will it fluff up carpet pile and suck up hidden dirt and dander? No. But I'll tell you what it will do: it will make your floors, both tile/hardwood and carpet look clean and tidy. It will pick up all that daily junk that accumulates on your floors that you simply don't feel like dragging out the vacuum cleaner for. It will swivel into all kinds of nooks and crannies and underneath shelving, tables and appliances to nab all of those crumbs and dust bunnies that evade your big vacuum. So treat as it is meant to be treated, bearing in mind that it is not a super tricked out vacuum with tons of suction power (it in fact has no suction, simply an electric sweeping mechanism that sweeps the particles into the dust tray) and I don't think you will be as disappointed as some of the reviews I have read.    I have had mine for about 2 weeks. I use it daily and I just had to charge it for the first time two days ago. It is important to follow the directions for charging and DON'T overcharge it as it sounds like that will drain the battery life. I empty the dirt tray after every use as it is very easy to do so and the tray does not hold a lot of material. I have two long-haired pets and while the Sweeper does a fine job of picking up their hair, the hair then proceeds to get tangled inthe rotatating brushes. I find that once every 3 uses or so I need to remove the plastic guard and untangle the hair from the brushes. This is a quick and easy process using my hands or the little gadget they give you for this purpose.    I have been very pleased with the Swivel Sweeper. It has made my life infinitely easier not having to drag out my full-sized upright vacuum every day. It has its limitations but I find that the positives outweigh the negatives. I recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a solution to the daily dirt, dust, and hair that find their way onto your floors (unless of course, you like bonding with your vacuum cleaner on a daily basis :-)",2009-06-22

I guess they were coming out with the new model and were trying to get rid of the older model.  I have to say I was expecting this product to be a great disappointed but was pleasantly surprised how well it has worked for me.   I've only had it for about 1-1/2 weeks but I'v been using it daily and the charge usually lasts about 3 cleaning sessions which mainly consists of tile and hardwood floors.   I have a central vac and it's a bit of a chore to haul the hose and all the parts into the house from the garage every day, so this handy tool to have around for intermittent cleaning.  It beats trying to sweep up short dog hairs with a broom and dustpan.  You do have to go slowly over the floors a few times to pick up the small hairs and particles but when I clean out the dust pan, there is definitely a lot of dog hair being picked up.  I also liked the design where the dust pan snaps on and off the bottom.  I had bought the Shark sweeper that was much more expensive from Costco and it worked great for 30 days until the spring on the hands-off dust pan became loose and the lid would no longer stay on the dust pan so all the dirt that was swept up would basically droop off the bottom when I released the dust pan.  Luckily, Costco takes returns with no questions asked.  I actually think the swivel has a better design and the battery is easier to manage because you don't have to wait until the charge is completely gone to recharge it like the Shark sweeper.  I just saw the information on the swivel sweeper for 2 for $39.99 and I'm thinking of getting more of these.  they make great gifts.",2009-07-04

I'm so sorry they've had problems. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I agree with the person who said you have to have realistic expectations. It's not a vacuum cleaner. But for this disabled individual who cannot schlep or manage anything greater than two pounds, this is PERFECT! And it works really well. In fact, it just picked up kitty litter on a battery that was almost dead!    Here's my tale:    About two and a half years ago, I had hideous 35-year-old wall-to-wall shag carpeting torn out, exposing GORGEOUS hardwood floors, which I had sanded and polyurethaned. I immediately purchased a Swivel Sweeper and a microfiber mop. (See Simplee Cleen Microfiber Household Swivel Mop Kit with Two Microfiber Pads) I Swivel Sweep and Swivel Mop about once a week. After I Swivel Sweep, I spritz water mixed with a bit of white vinegar on my floors and mop. I believe the correct proportion is 1/2 cup of vinegar to a gallon of water. But I don't measure. Anyway, my floors are still incredibly beautiful after two and a half years.     And the ONLY reason I recently replaced my Swivel Sweeper is because I accidentally threw out the dust tray. But for $29.59, I got another Swivel Sweeper and I now have spare parts ... including a spare battery.     Otherwise, I believe my original model would still be going strong after over 100 uses!    I see they have a new model. Maybe I'll get that in another two years. But for now, I'm very happy with my product and my floors, which is a good thing. Having floors sanded and polyurethaned is well worth the very messy effort. But I don't want to do it again in my lifetime!    Carol",2009-07-18

I'm still giving it a try, and so far I would say that I am not totally displeased with the product. As long as you lower your expectations a bit and don't expect it to do everything the ad says, you won't be totally disappointed.  First, this sweeper does not work well on carpet.  It works well on tile, linoleum, wood or faux wood.  I really wanted something to sweep the kitchen and bathroom floors.  Having a dog and a teenager, this product does a great job of getting hair, crumbs, dirt, and the like cleaned up quickly and easily emptied.  Swivel Sweeper is much easier to use than a broom and dustpan.  You will need to remove the hair from the brushes often. As stated many times, do not overcharge the battery.  I have followed the directions and it does not hold a charge for very long.  I wait until the battery is completely dead before recharging and remove the battery after every use. The charge lasts long enough for me to clean the areas I want, but little more.  For what I expected, the product is adequate.  If you expect everything \\""AS Seen on TV\\"", you will be very disappointed.  The jury is still out on whether the battery will last very long.

It's light weight and swivel to get around tight crevices. It also does a fairly decent cleaning job right up against the wall on hard floors and even carpets. Although for carpet cleaning in the central area of the room, you're better off using a conventional vacuum cleaner for that. The reason for this, that this sweeper is not a vacuum but a power brush system that would only get the surface dust off the carpet leaving the ground in dust.<br /><br />We bought this sweeper to use on hard floors prior to washing them. For that function it does extremely well, keeping the mop relatively lint free. For use on carpeting, you have to be careful that you don't cause the sweeper to flip and spilling the contents back onto the carpet. Since this kind of sweeper with no suction doesn't clean ground in dirt well on carpeting, I would not recommend it for this purpose.<br /><br />we bought the original Swivel Sweeper as well as the improved Swivel Sweeper G2. When comparing the two, they both clean equally well. The Swivel Sweeper G2 is a little bit more convenient to use because of the refinement such as easier emptying as well as the articulating handle when you need to go underneath furniture. other then the convenient enhancement, both machines cleans equally well. I highly recommend either machine for use around the house on hard floors in place of a broom and dust pan.<br /><br />Final thoughts: For maximum battery longevity,it is best to run the batteries down to a certain degree before recharging. When recharging, be sure to charge more than eight hours but no more than 24 hours maximum. The nickel metal hydride battery pack is consists of six cells. This type of battery shouldn't have any memory effect unlike nickel cadmium ones. My personal feeling is based on past experience that most of these types of products generally use low quality batteries that may not last very long. When the battery wears out, I may consider rebuilding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells.ding it with higher quality nickel metal hydride cells.",2009-08-29

I originally saw the infomercial so I immediately thought it couldn't be that great.  But when I saw it at my local BBB about a year ago, I bought it knowing that I could return it if it was crap.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is NOT my primary vacuum.

We have all tile flooring on the first floor of our home so I figured it'd be handy to pick up things that I didn't want to bring out the Dyson for.<br /><br />Here are the features that I like:<br /><br />*It's super light.  I can easily pick it up and move it around.  It glides easily on tile and on my rugs.<br />*The dirt holding chamber is great b/c you get to see exactly what you picked up!<br />*((this is the part I was really surprised by))  It picks up smaller threads, pet hair, debris from my rugs that my Dyson left behind.  Because I can't use the \\""carpet\\"" feature on my Dyson while vacuuming my rugs (it makes that horrid noise) -- it just glides over some debris and does not pick it up.  But when I use the swivel sweeper on the rug, it completely picks up tons of stuff, including woven in pet hair.  LOVE IT!<br /><br />Now onto the criticisms:<br />*It's very loud.  You don't ever hear the noise on the infomercial.  This doesn't really bother me and it's not loud enough to bother my dogs but my husband commented that they don't tell you how loud it is.<br />*If you accidentally roll it over carpet and it tips over, your sweeped up contents can fall out.  Not a huge deal until you get the hang of it.<br />*minor complaint -- I wish the battery had a low level indicator.  Instead, I just leave it in the swivel sweeper and since I don't use it as my primary vacuum, it's not really a problem.  I don't run out of charge for several weeks or at least a month.  I leave the battery in until it absolutely runs out.  Then I charge for at least 24 hours before using again.

They simply do not compare, except perhaps that the Swivel Sweeper with its flimsy construction is a bit more lightweight.  First, I had to laugh at the reviewer who suggested the Swivel Sweeper should be targeted to bald consumers!  That is so true. I have a lot of hair and I have to clean the swivel sweeper's inside out (think, dusty, dirty) each and every time I want to use it, because my hair is twisted around each rotating element, approximately 8 rotators I have to use a box knife to cut and pull on.  This has virtually eliminated any convenience of the product.  When it does get going it does an Okay job of picking up cat litter, etc, but tends to spit out other things, especially when its tiny collection box becomes on the full side.  I am going to try to return this, but suspect I am out the $.  I would say to anyone considering this to think again and buy the Shark.  My Mom owns the newer Shark sweeper and it has a convenient emptying reservoir that you don't have to touch to empty.

None of these sweepers are really meant for carpeting, but if you have a lot of hardwood/ceramic floors, the Shark is for you.<br /><br />And as for the one star, I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for 3 weeks not and it is broken, makes a horrible sounds and will not rotate even though I have faithfully cleaned out any hair/string that may be clogging it.

It can go under almost anything and I love that there are brushes on every side of it, so it can pick up debris in corners of the house easily.  It is a good size that can fit into small places you normally wouldn't get to.

They work very well & are a great alternative to vacuuming. They are not meant to replace vacuuming but if you live in a house with kids that get cereal all over the floor, or you need to sweep a high traffic area there is nothing better than these sweepers, period.    THE GOOD:   They charge quickly and are always ready to use. The unit is so lightweight it glides fast over large areas & I believe picks up & cleans a big area faster than a vacuum could do considering the heavier weight & slow moving with the vacuum.  you can expect the sweeper to pick up 95% of dirt & small particles. Anything small gets swept into the chamber but if the object is larger (like a marble or pen cap) it may not fit or may clog the brush area. This is easy remedied by removing the clogged item by hand, or just avoid any object bigger than a marble. Super small stuff like dust & fine dirt may not get picked because this is a  sweeper, not a vacuum. But you're still going to vacuum once in awhile, right?   The sweeper works on all flat floors & low pile carpet (but it does the best job on hardwood & tile floors or a non-carpeted surface)  This product will pick up all the VISIBLE stuff on the floor so its great fora fast clean up or when you have company coming over & you don't have time to vacuum. These work ten times better than a broom regarding speed & easy of use. They also don't create dust clouds while sweeping so if you're an allergy sufferer this is better than using a traditional broom.  When new, these units also hold a very long charge & can sweep endlessly, I can't imagine not being able to finish a sweeping job when the unit is fully charged. As the unit ages though expect the charge to dissipate as all rechargeable batteries eventually wear out. I saw another review that said the manual warns against over-charging which can kill the battery over time, so perhaps take the battery off the charger after 24 hoursso it doesn't get over-charged.    THE BAD:  these units are a bit flimsy so you can't expect them to last like $200 vacuum. If you aren't careful the pole will bend or crack, & little plastic pieces can break in the sweeper. I had part of the top tray come loose on my last sweeper but it was easily fixed with a piece of clear tape (or duct tape). All the negative reviews about these breaking make me wonder, do people realize this is a $20 item? I've about to purchase my third unit, but I don't mind because we've gotten about 2 years out of each one. Again for $20 even if I had to replace one every 6 months I'd still do it because there is nothing on the market at this price that does as good as a job. We literally use this every day on our floors & could not live without it.   The unit does have a tendency to collect hair around the brush. I've found this does not affect the sweeper operation unless you really let it get bad & never clean it. Otherwise the brush is cleanable by hand & pulling out the hair & debris or by using a scissor or brush-cleaning tool to remove caught material.  Over time the tiny feet that make this unit glide over your floor will wear down & become thinner. When this happens the sweeper will not work as well because the brush will be too close to the floor & make the motor run slower. However it takes a long time to wear out the feet, probably a year or two with daily use so this is not a big deal. But note that if you wore the feet out you probably got more than your money's worth.  The dust tray release is a little flimsy but operational.  you sometimes have to sweep over an area a few times to get all the items you are trying to sweep up, remember this is not a vacuum so there is no suction. Considering that it works surprisingly well & get most everything with the first pass.    SUMMARY:  Great unit, no serious complaints. I think this product is better than the average reviews it is getting, simply because I don't think you can ding aproduct because it doesn't last forever. Performance-wise its exceptional at sweeping, 5 stars. This will do much better than a small cheap hand-vacuum or stick vacuum because I've tried many of them. Of course its not going to do as well as a full upright vacuum. For its design & price it is exceptional. When this unit first came out it was $39 on sale. Now its half that price new. If you buy this unit be realistic, its not a $200 vacuum. You may have to replace it in 6 months or a year but at $20 for something you use daily, I think this is still a good investment (I get about two years out of mine before they die). There are very few items you can buy for $20 that are going to last forever. This is the best alternative to daily vacuuming especially for hardwood & tile floors and nothing is faster for a quick clean up. Can't see how you would not like this product.",2010-08-14

Sure it eliminates having to mess with a dust pan if you use a broom, but you still have to bend over to release and reinstall the very small built in dust tray.    It does pick up link and large particles, but not as effectively as a broom does, especially if you are not in a rush with the broom.     This is our second unit and although its convenient (which is its only real, useful, benefit, the battery life is poor (this is our second unit    I'm away that he new G2 model has a much improved battery, but the price is triple what you can get the original sweeper for, and ten times higher than a broom.    The motor is very weak (I've experienced this one two brand new units) and if anyone has long hair in the household, it will wrap around the brushes and really lower battery life to barely a few minutes between charges (barely enough to get the kitchen floor done)    Considering that it does not pick up everything off the floor, you can only use it on smooth floors (on rugs and carpets, the motor slows down so much that it reduces battery life to about one minute), and you have to clean out the dust tray every time you use it because it fills too quickly, its barely worth $20 that its available for at the time of this writing, but its convenient for a quick pickup of lint if you plan on emptying the dust pan at a later time.",2010-12-08

At first, I liked it, because it's light and easy to operate if you have to clean small areas  - like kitchen, every day (it's not good for thorough cleaning). It picked every little dust or crumbs that fall from the table and very easy to clean it - just empty the container in the garbage bin or a bag- so I liked it. After a while I noticed, though I charged the battery, it would only work for a short time and then suddenly stop! Then, it started happenning all the time, it'd work for 10 seconds and then shut off for no reason. I contacted with the manufacturer and they told me that I need to replace the battery, also gave a tip that when I don't use the Sweeper I have to take the battery out, and never to leave battery in the charger once it's charged, and never to recharge until the battery completely runs out of energy. Now I don't know if it's worth buying another battery or not. In total, I used my Swivel Sweeper normally only for a few months out of 2 years that I have it.

I have owned my Swivel Sweeper for about a year and use it almost daily.  The pickup is great, even picks up tons of pet hair and small crumbs.  Works great on low pile carpet, tile and hardwoods.  I don't think it picks up heavy stuff like coins.  You do have to clean the brushes often with the little tool provided, especially if you get a lot of long hair on your floors, but it's not a big deal.  I have not been dissappointed with the battery as some others have mentioned.  Of course it would be nice if the charge lasts longer, but I do think the 45 minutes of cleaning time is about accurate.  I only use it for 5-10 minutes at a time, so I don't have to constantly charge it.  After about 6+ months of good use, the tip of the rubber handle broke which does not affect performance or use.  But at that sametime the sliders started to fall off, which makes it useless because without the sliders it will scratch your floors and won't slide around smoothly.  I went to the website, found my exact model and ordered the replacement sliders.  It took weeks to get them, and turned out they sent the wrong ones, they didn't fit/were a totally different shape.  I called customer service and ended up on the phone with them for 37 minutes, speaking to 3 different people about the problem.  They all insisted they have to be the correct ones, even though the shape and size did not match up at all.  They were not helpful at all and seemed almost ignorant and bordering on rude.  In the end, they agreed to send me a different set, but they doubt it will be the correct ones, and it will take 4-8 weeks!  A few days later I noticed my Mom had a Swivel Sweeper at her house, but it was an older/discontinued model she bought from a discount store for cheap and her sweeper had the same sliders the company sent me as replacements.  Needless to say, I'm annoyed.  I can't be without my sweeper for another 4-8 weeks, so I'll have to go buy a brand new one.  Wish I did that from the beginning.  I thought about buying the Shark, but I really like the sliding feature, which I don't think any other sweeper has.

True works of art that show that the author is amazingly talented.  However, upon selecting a project to start, I noticed that the length of the quilling strips used are 10 5/8 inch (27 cm) long.  It's difficult to find quilling supplies let alone strips that are pre-measured to that length.  This meant cutting down strips to 10 5/8 inch long.  The author then has us divide the strips into 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/5 lengths claiming that \\""this method is easy to pick out the desired strip length without having to use a ruler\\"".  This may be true, but involves several hours beforehand of using a ruler to not only cut my strips to 10 5/8 inch, but also down into further lengths.  This really complicates things and seems unnecessarily time consuming, even for quillers who have gobs of patience.  After cutting strips down, I started to put together the designs and some lengths still didn't seem right.  One pattern in particular was quite a bit larger than the photo.

We have tile floors, a huge dog and a toddler. I use it every night to sweep up the floors after dinner and I use it on the tile before I steam clean them (using my Enviro-steamer which is awesome). It acutally has a really strong suction, sucks up cereal, dog hair, food the baby drops, and just about anything I roll over.  I have a really good vacuum but on the tile, this works much better.  I do not use this on carpet so I'm not sure how it would work on that. I love the swivel handle and it's really easy to empty.

First off, the Swivel is the best sweeper out there for hardwoods.  Most particles drift to the baseboard so having the 4 corner brushes is invaluable.  We've used $100 plus cordless sweepers with vacuum suction and they still don't hold a candle to the Swivel.  Also, other sweepers don't flatten out for under furniture (where most dirt collects) as perfectly as this product.    In order to save some money we purchased through Amazon via Capital Outlet.  Product arrived brand new, but battery died in 1/8 of the time of previous experiences.  We can usually do the entire downstair (1200 sq ft) twice before needing a charge, and this didn't last a quarter of the floor.  Subsequent full charges (not exceeding 24 hours) with full discharges did not improve battery life.  Like I said, we've used Swivels for years and are familiar with use.  We returned product and purchased through an expensive retail outlet chain.

The letters are reportedly from 1922 but instead of using reproduction fabrics of the era, the author used Civil War reproduction fabrics for the blocks that illustrate the book. The quilt block patterns weren't necessarily available in the early 1920s either. For example, the Century of Progress block used in this book wasn't published until 1933 - more than a decade after the letters were written. Instead of this book, consider something by Barbara Brackman - a noted quilt historian. Ms. Brackman is very likely to have her facts straight!    If, like me, you thought this book would be a good way to learn about using traditional piecing techniques, save your money. The book offers no tips or instructions for using the templates and diagrams. (If you order the Kindle edition, you won't even GET the templates!) There's a Yahoo! mailing list but heaven help the quilter who asks THAT group for help. In the few weeks I've been a member, I've seen responses ranging from \\""Take a class!\\"" to \\""Buy the companion software if you want instructions.\\"" I'm no longer a beginner and wasn't looking for a beginning-level project but a few pages of general instructions about the author's chosen construction technique or suggestions for organizing the 106 templates required would have been useful. The back cover says \\""everything you need\\"" so I expected the book to be reasonably complete.    I've made over 100 blocks from Sylvia's Bridal Sampler by Jennifer Chiaverini. In my experience, it's a much better project for learning about traditional techniques. Chiaverini includes instructions to make blocks using several different methods: rotary cutting, templates, paper-piecing, and applique. Blocks range from the simple 9-patch to the complicated Mrs. Cleveland's Choice with 65 pieces. I've learned a lot from working on that project and have enjoyed the Yahoo! mailing list community that focuses on Chiaverini's books and patterns.    I think I'll donate my Farmer's Wife Sampler to a library. The historical inaccuracies, coupled with the shortcomings of the templates and piecing diagrams, have led me to conclude it's not worth the space it takes on my bookshelf.

Done.  Not only am I skeezed out by the thought of making a perfectly edible food into a non edible art, GOLD DUST is frigging pricey!  Not to mention people starving, sorry, it just made me mad, it seems wildy inappropriate right now.<br /><br />Golden Walnut Ball - Stick walnuts, real ones, onto a ball, spray paint them gold. this one would probably last a holiday or two, but it is again, food being wasted.  I grew up in a trailerpark and wasting food bothers me, I know, get over yourself, but old habits and all that.<br /><br />Gourd Candles - Melt wax into a hollowed out gourd, light it on fire.  Okay, okay, there is no directive to light it on fire, and I will admit the candles are pretty and props for the fact that people don't eat gourds (can they be eaten?) but these will be a one-dinner-party attraction and I'm kinda craft-challenged, if I go to the expense and time of making something, I'd like it to be around for more than a couple of hours.<br /><br />But some of the crafts were genius, for example;<br /><br />A paper Sail centerpiece for a Thankgiving feast, the pictures show a perfectly pristine craft stick, but I think a dry stick from the garden could work just as well, same with the tiny bucket of rocks - I like that it's easily found and cheap!<br /><br />Pilgrim Hats and Bonnets - easily made by kids, talk about a real Thanksgiving celebration, you could really get into the spirit of Thanksgiving and everyone could make their own!<br /><br />Napkin rings made of paper or felt or acorns(I have a few acorns in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).  There's a big section at the back of the book with clip art for various crafts.  Very helpful.<br /><br />The crafts range in skill level from easy, pumkin pouch party favors (if you can use tape and scissors you're ready for this one) to the expert, pumpkin carving that DaVinci would approve of.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty comprehensive book, I only found a few crafts to try out myself, felt fortune cookies, flower pop up cards and the excellent directions for papier mache.  But mostly this is a book for the serious crafters who live next door to a Michaels Craft store.s in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).

There have been a dizzying number of Tie sets: there were a few standard Tie Fighters (#7146 and #7263), Darth Vader's variant (#7150 and #8017), Tie Bomber (#4479), Tie Intercepter (#6209), and the hyper-drive equipped Tie Defender (#8087). There have been two Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) Tie Fighters: Vader's (#10175) and an Intercepter (#7181). Set 9492, introduced in January of 2012, is arguably the best of the standard, playable Tie Fighters to date. The UCS sets are in their own league as they place a premium on authenticity over playability, and carry high price tags as well. And there have been mini-scale Tie Fighters as well.  The major change with this version is the construction of the radiators, the large black hexagonal panels on each side of the craft. In addition to the usual plates, Lego has run a band of tile around the edge (a technique more commonly referred to as studs-not-on-top, or SNOT). Along with smaller detailing, the radiators are a much better representation than prior sets, and they are arguably stronger. Another change in the design evolution is the use of a new cockpit window that is more cleanly spherical. Beyond this, the design features are smaller, such as the use of side-facing roof tiles to give the craft sharper edges.  The set comes with a pilot, an imperial officer, Death Star trooper, and R5-J2 droid. The trooper's helmet is new and nicely designed, as is the droid's new conical head. The craft also has two flick-fire missiles situated underneath the cockpit dome.  In terms of playability, this set is not as interesting as Lego's new X-Wing fighter (#9493), but I believe the general thinking is that kids (or their parents) will buy the X-Wing or Millennium Falcon (7965) first, and then buy the Tie Fighter so they can stage a dogfight. In this regard, the new Tie Fighter is a great set and does an admirable job of being the bad guy. Parents, you are forewarned that, depending on the age of your children, you may be conscripted into fixing battle damaged Lego spacecraft; I think this is a fair exchange for a toy that can be built and modified. Until children learn to fix the craft on their own, it can be very frustrating for a parent, even one that loves Lego. Patience Iago, patience. Inner peace, inner peace. Find a happy place. Serenity now.  As I mention in my other Lego reviews, you can go to Youtube and search for lengthy reviews of this set. It helps to see this craft handled.",2012-01-31

It's cute, it's girly, but it's not as \\""Lego\\"" as a \\""traditional\\"" set. Of the 222 pieces, SO MANY of them are \\""accessories.\\""  Utensils, foods, etc.  Not very much for building and more for playing very teeny pretend play.  But you're paying Lego prices for that.  It competes well with things like littlest pet shop, ponies, etc, but not so well with other lego sets.  My daughter also has some other lego favorites she thinks are cool - the lighthouse with the light-up brick, the camping trailer with car to pull it (we own a camper), the 3-in-1 fishing cabin, etc.  For actual building, you get more bang for your buck with the \\""traditional\\"" sets. They are also more challenging and time-consuming which she likes.  It hardly took any time at all to put this set together and now it just sits on her shelf.

The wings are definitely not going anywhere (unless you really pulled it apart) and it just feels sturdy.  The only minor exception to this is the cockpit cover, which falls off relatively easily when opening and closing it, but otherwise stays solidly in place.  The only downside to this set is that it's pretty boring to build.  The center module is moderately challenging and fun, and doing one half of one of the wings is also challenging and fun. The boring part is that each wing is identical, and each half of each wing is also identical, so you build the half wings four times and then attach them near the end.  The instructions are oddly confusing here too, because they put \\""x2\\"" in several places, which made sense after reading through it all, but it actually meant you had to do big sections x4 (x2x2). Total build time about 1.5 hrs. Comes in three bags; first bag is center unit with two smaller bags inside, and other two bags are one wing each. If you can figure out how to share the instruction book, you could easily do these out of order.  If you're like me, and you prefer enjoying the end result that you built rather than the build process itself, the boring build isn't that big of a deal, so I still give it 5 stars.

We returned it the next day. The build was fine - neither interesting nor too complicated, although too particular for him to do on his own correctly. But the problem is the playability - it has fallen apart 5 times in one day of play. The wings regularly come off, which messes up the core ship & needing a rebuild from scratch. If you put the wings back on and press too hard, the entire core collapses.  This is the only Lego item we've ever gotten that falls apart so easily.

I was stunned that the wing borders fit on so perfectly, and there is a little piece on the front and back corners of the wing to keep the grey border from sliding off. The struts on the side look amazing and are likewise expertly crafted. The cockpit is not perfectly round but the designers did an admirable job with their choice of LEGO bricks.  I may be the minority, but I also love that it comes with flick-fire missiles. They never get old.  The minifigures are great. The TIE fighter pilot has a face under the helmet, but it's kind of pale since it is printed on a black head. Still fun, though. This is also my first Imperial Officer, which is exciting.  The wings connect to the body a lot better than previous iterations. They don't wobble as much when you're swooshing it around your house, and they don't fall off as easily. The wings are made up of lots of plates, so you have to keep an eye out for pieces coming loose during play, but usually it all holds together well.  The TIE fighter is bigger than I thought. It looks slightly out of scale to both the 6206 TIE Interceptor and 8017 Darth Vader's TIE. But the size of the model makes the price a little easier to swallow.",2012-02-10

Each LH runs on a pair of \\""C\\"" alkaline batteries estimated by manufacturer to last 6 months.  We shall see.<br /><br />On the LH are two switches, the top one provides you the option of toggling it's function as either a Light House or a Virtual Wall. By strategically placing the Light Houses, one can divide the cleaning area into two sections and the pair together divides the cleaning area into 3 cleaning areas - to be cleaned in succession one after the other, the LHs signals for Roomba to systematically complete one area before allowing it to move into & clean the next area, and in turn the third area.  This way the cleaning is more effectively managed for better results.  When all the sections are complete, the LHs navigate the Roomba back to its charging base.  This is what is referred to as the \\""Room To Room Navigation\\"" capability.  A very useful feature for the larger home.<br /><br />The Virtual wall OTOH, simply prohibits the Roomba from crossing to the other side.  This works to keep Roomba out of areas not requiring cleaning or the Scooba from your carpets or expensive rugs.<br /><br />My first run took 1 hour to clean 150sqf.  Today I deployed the LHs and Roomba effectively cleaned each section for 25mins each before returning to it's base. Beautiful navigation. The same upstairs.  I can't praise the 780 enough.

I have had the rack installed for only a few short weeks and anyone who comes over always has a positive comment.  Be sure to locate a stud in the wall to secure the rack since it will be holding a good amount of weight.  The mounting system is basically  3 screws into the wall and doesnt give much flexibility if you have to be on a stud.

Still - running it felt like a noisy toy from the 60s. Easy enough to empty with note to REMEMBER NOT TO turn the sweeper upside down as debris could fall out of the two gaps there. Great portability for seniors.  Shonky quality but for the price $20 - it goes where the iRobots are not allowed to go.  I wonder what the differences are to the G2 and G3 (battery life aside)  ANOTHER DOWNSIDE: CHARGER DOES NOT INDICATE WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL - I find myself wondering when to take it out.  Read a lot of review of peeps frying their batteries or needing to buy new ones.  SNEAKY!<br />=======================================================================================<br /><br />Mine came RED, but is NOT the G2 or G3 after all - I am hoping it's not a fake (I see a lot of black units when not G2 or G3)...<br /><br />Got this online for $19.95 plus $11 shipping.<br />A little carried away when I first noticed it, I had not realised there is a 2nd and 3rd generation which has better batteries, the 90degree elbow joint and touchless bin opener.<br />Package arrived today and here's the take.<br /><br />Features are great.  Quality is iffy.  I can't imagine this unit was sold previously for $98 (claimed online) unless there is a drop in quality specs or change of manufacturing source. The handle is a two part screw on like the pledge swiffer - just feels a lot flimsier.  Like the battery charger and battery which is currently charging for at least 8hrs prior to use.  Glad though that the shaft is \\""bendable\\"" though the mechanism felt very flimsy.  Even happier that the \\""touchless bin\\"" is there. The 4 rows of brushes are sparse and not dense - hence be interesting to see how much is picked up, how much is missed, how long it takes to finish the job and wear & tear.<br /><br />First run [on stair carpet]:<br />After 9-10 hour charge, sounded underpowered but was quite surprisingly able to pick up carpet lint and debris on stairs with just a light swivel rolling motion (w/o force). The manouver was less than ideal as the Sweeper \\""Stick\\"" was not as rigid as one would like due to the many joints and parts making it already \\""rickety\\"". If more robust, would keep this for the stairs.  Post-cleaning: Lint, hair and fluff is wound around the bearings and the need to pick fluff out of the bristle is a real chore.<br /><br />Second run results [on back patio for picking up palm seeds and light dirt & debris] - was originally intending the SS for our small patio (trees are always shedding something) but seem very underpowered and I wonder if the bristles are heavy duty enough to withstand the non slip surface. UPDATE: OK, so I had a quick run of the SS at the front porch picking up grass debris and fallouts from a wasp nest - worked like a dream despite the light suction. It managed to pick up palm seeds very quickly, wood chip debris and your small to average sized dried leaves quite well.  Due to low suction, you may need repeat sweeping action (2-3x) to get the result you want.ong it takes to finish the job and wear & tear.<br /><br />First run [on stair carpet]:<br />After 9-10 hour charge, sounded underpowered but was quite surprisingly able to pick up carpet lint and debris on stairs with just a light swivel rolling motion (w/o force).

That said, this piece looks great.  Absolutely badass and is pretty much a must have.  If you can get it for ~$0.10/piece, then go for it.  But, the reason why it's not perfect is the build is absolutely boring as heck.  As is expected given the complexity of the ship itself, and the fact that it's just mainly two big \\""wings\\"".  It's definitely wise to build both wings at the same time, but on the other hand, that decreases the length of the build time.  But given how boring a build it is, it's better to just get it over with and get to the final presentation.  Several people have said that it's flimsy, but i've had no problems with mine.  The key is with the final \\""bracket\\"" pieces that you slide on to each individual wing before sliding the wing onto the center cockpit piece.  You gotta make sure you press each leg onto the wing solidly and INDIVIDUALLY.  Once you do, this thing isn't gonna fall apart.  If your 8 yr old kid is trying to accomplish this, then that's probably why it's falling apart so easily.  That bracket needs a pretty good amount of force to get the studs into the female receptors.<br /><br />At the end of the day, way too quick a build, but it looks fantastic.

With most, it's a bit of a process. I pick them up, turn them over and over in my hands, put them down, walk away. I'll go home and think about it. Do I really need another deck of cards right now? Can I find them used? I'll go back to the store and pretend to browse other things in the same general area, all the while knowing that I'm having a man versus self moment.<br /><br />The day I purchased these cards, there was no decision process. I picked up the box and never put it down. It was either pay for it or a misdemeanor. Included in the set are the card deck, instruction booklet, and spread poster.<br /><br />The illustrations on the cards are best described as modern surrealism. As the name suggests, the moon is featured and visible on each of the seventy-eight cards in the pack. The pack also contains a title card as well as information about the artist. The illustrations themselves are bright, bold, dynamic, and intriguing. On a few occasions, I've found myself being drawn in to the vignettes. Each card features an illustration. Some of the traditional archetypes of the tarot are portrayed, but each card has its own story and personality. The cards are very reminiscent of the films of Neil Gaiman (Mirrormask, Neverwhere).<br /><br />The deck size and card weight is fairly standard. The card corners are slightly rounded, the cards shuffle well, and they are fairly easy to manage.<br /><br />As someone who's been reading cards for over twenty years, I would not necessarily recommend the cards to someone starting out. Because the artwork differs so greatly from the Rider-Waite deck (which seems to be the standard deck used for learning card interpretation), it may be a little daunting to adjust to the slightly sinister nature of this pack. The instruction booklet is generic at best. Beyond the author's dedication, the information is pretty standard across all decks produced by US Games.",2012-03-04

This is a great tool for making coils, and this version also includes an attached clamp, which appears to be screwed on, so I guess you could remove it if you need to. It appears very durable, and I love the length and sizes of coils I can make with the crank rods. The \\""working area\\"" of the crank rods is just under 8 inches.<br /><br />I was frustrated that the product description did not give the diameters of the five crank rods, so I emailed Artistic Wire, who always respond promptly. Their response: \\""Unfortunately, we do not have exact sizes for the rods. As they can vary slightly. If you are looking at this tool to make jump rings for chain maille. It does not have the precise measurements needed for that function.\\""<br /><br />So, I measured them myself. My \\""Digital Thickness Gauge\\"" seems inconsistent, so I used my SWG wire gauge (I don't have an AWG gauge). With it, they measured 18-gauge (1.22mm), 15-gauge (1.83mm), 10-gauge (3.25mm), 8-gauge (4.06mm) and 6-gauge (4.88mm). (For those of you who might have the Econo Winder, for comparison purposes, the crank rod sizes on mine are the same as the 1.2mm and 1.83mm rods on the Deluxe.) Of course, according to the Artistic Wire email, others might not have the same sizes.<br /><br />I bought it off eBay for $14.99, and sadly, I saw today that my local Michael's store has started carrying it just this week (they have improved their jewelry-making tools section) and their price is $10.99, which is the same price as on the Artistic Wire website.

The x-wing is a sturdy beast!  Even with my son's own modifications (he likes to have a gunner pointing back, since that is where the enemy fire always succeeded in the first movie), we really haven't had too much difficulty with it. That can't be said so emphatically about the TIE Fighter, though it's still a really cool set!<br /><br />I know someone else commented on another's review that if you want to play with them, you should buy the non-lego play sets for Star Wars-- but the beauty, to me, is that with lego-- you CAN pretend to battle them and have \\""real\\"" damage.  You can also modify them to be better fighters, as my son did with the x-wing.  Legos are, after all, toys-- not models.<br /><br />So... with that in mind-- The TIE Fighter is certainly a more fragile lego toy then the other Star War ships.  The side \\""wings\\"" (or whatever they are) are big and are made of smaller pieces, kept flat, so of course they aren't the most durable structures.  I plan to try to get some larger black flat pieces to sort of reinforce the seams a bit.  Though this will be less flat, I think it will hold up better.  They also attach to the actual \\""ship\\"" (the little ball in the middle)in kind of a fragile way... and I really don't know how they could've done that better-- But it hasn't been too much of an issue.  The only thing is-- when something does \\""pop\\"" in that area, a major reconstruction is necessary to replace things.  (But this is also partly because my son tries to do it himself without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.  My son went into this knowing that (we read reviews before we ordered) and while it's caused a bit of frustration, I still think he is very happy with it and does not regret ordering it!  (BTW-- my son is 8)<br /><br />When I ordered this, it was $5 cheaper then at the lego site.  Even so, I still can't give a lego star wars kit 5 stars but that is ONLY BECAUSE OF PRICE.  I know a lot of design must go into these things and I don't want to undervalue that aspect-- but in reality, we are talking plastic bricks.  When ANY lego set costs 300 bucks (the death star) and it's really just a bunch of plastic bricks, I can't help but think it just may be over priced....self without consulting the building guide again...)<br /><br />OVERALL-- it is a pretty faithful reproduction of the ship from the movies, and is very cool-- But if you are getting this for a younger kid that will actually want to battle with it, be sure he knows that it's a more-fragile construction then the other models.

It was installed on July 4th and burned out on September 11th.  My hall light is on most of the time (it is really only out when no-one is at home).  I would estimate the bulb lasted 600-800 hours....very disappointing.<br /><br />----- earlier review<br />Not much to say about this product.  It does appear to be the same brightness as a 50W bulb as advertised.  I placed this one in my central hallway which is lit almost all the time I'm home (I previously had a CFL in that location).  In 10 years I think this fixture has had two CFL's replaced since it's on about 14 hours a day (it's off when I leave for work).  The light is a slightly yellow warm white.<br /><br />The nice thing about this bulb is that it is almost exactly the same form factor as regular lightbulb, so it should be able to fit in any normal fixture.  This was a problem in one of my bathrooms with a very tiny fixture. I think a good pricepoint for this type of light would be about $5-$7.  The current $10 (at the time I'm writing this) is a little bit high, but would be fine if you need it for a fixture that is lit most of the day.<br /><br />It would have a cost savings even against a CFL, and certainly against a regular bulb.  If you are replacing a conventional incandescent bulb, this bulb should have a pay-back time of only about 1400 hours if your local electrical cost is $0.12/kW-hr.  If you replacing a CFL this would have a much longer payback time (several years), since a CFL is already very efficient.  If you factor in the cost of the CFL, and that these last much longer than a fluorescent bulb, the payback gets much better, again on the order of 1000-2000 hours (depending on the life-span and cost of the CFL you are replacing).<br /><br />You should be aware that while these bulb have an extremely long life span (great for those really hard to reach fixtures), they do very gradually get dimmer over the years.",2012-08-03

But now the Amazon product page shows a different product called \\""ChiChinLighting® 9 Watt LED Bulb\\"". I wish Amazon would stop using this bait-and-switch trick.<br /><br />==== original review follows ====<br /><br />One unusual feature of this [[ASIN:B004BLDD9Y Lighting EVER 6 Watt LED Bulb]] is that it has a white ceramic heat sink. In contrast, the body of a typical LED bulb is made of an aluminum heat sink. The ceramic heat sink may offer the psychological benefit of being safer, since ceramic is electrically non-conductive. But whether it is as effective as aluminum heat sink is questionable. Previously I have tested the [[ASIN:B004YZRNKW Lighting EVER 7 Watt LED Light Bulb]] with similar heat sink design, and it burned out after just two weeks. This 6W version, however, seems to be doing well after one full month of usage.<br /><br />The power consumption of this LED bulb, according to my [[ASIN:B00009MDBU Kill-A-Watt Electricity Usage Monitor]], is 6W as advertised. Note that some other LED bulbs, such as the [[ASIN:B006Y4NPN0 Filite A19 5W Led Light Bulb]], may consume more power than advertised. Its Power Factor is only 0.62, which is not so good. (Lower power factor means more power is wasted in the transmission of energy)<br /><br />In side-by-side comparison with three other LED bulbs, this Lighting Ever 6W LED bulb is smaller in size (see photos I unloaded to 'Customer Images' section). It appears to have the similar brightness as other bulbs in the 6-7 watt, 400-500 lumen range. Its color temperature is slightly more bluish compared to [[ASIN:B005UPUMAI LG LED Bulb]] and  [[ASIN:B002ZBJ25G LWS A19 LED Bulb]], even though they are all called \\""warm white\\"".<br /><br />I must take issue with the manufacturer's claim that this 6W LED bulb is a \\""50W Incandescent Bulb Replacement\\"", because the latter actually generates about 650 lumens of light output. A 400 lumen LED bulb can only be called a \\""40W equivalent\\"" at best. The tricky part is that: the beam from this (and most other) LED bulb is concentrated in the forward direction. So when you look at the bulb from in front, it appears as bright as a 50W incandescent bulb. But when viewed from the side, it becomes much dimmer. That means this bulb works best in a recessed light fixture shinning down, but not good for upward-facing position in a chandelier or floor lamp.<br /><br />Overall, this inexpensive Lighting EVER 6W LED bulb performed reasonably well (so far). But I have to minus one star for its deceptive claim of \\""50W Equivalent\\"".<br /><br />[Update on Jan 2, 2013]<br />I opened the dead Lighting EVER 7W LED bulb, and found a busted polymer capacitor due to overheating. I also discovered that the bulb has no power regulation at all. There are just 60 tiny LEDs driven directly from rectified AC input. A small increase in AC voltage could cause the LED current to increase rapidly and induce a thermal run-away. I will stay away from all Lighting EVER products - for EVER.\\""40W equivalent\\"" at best.

She did do this and a couple others I got her. She'd do them all if I got them. This was for her 7th birthday. However, I was disappointed. She did them so quickly. They are easy. I feel LEGO dumbed this down for girls is all I can figure. But they didn't lower the price. Maybe purple and pink dyes are costly. The age on this says 6 - 12. I'd be SHOCKED an average 12 year old would care about this. However, this is the third Christmas my daughter - now almost 8 - has done pretty much all by herself the LEGO Christmas-themed sets that say age 12+. This year's did and had 1500 pieces. She was done in two days. No more than 8 hours. Three times asked for help - to locate something. Made one mistake that we could see. Makes me feel that LEGO teamed with the same folks who had t-shirts made that said \\""I'm to pretty to do my homework, so my brother does it for me\\"" or something like that. And from reading reviews of the books that follow these characters put out by DK, superficiality reigns - I hope not reality. But should not frustrate any 7-9 year olds out there.

This is a well designed item, made of quality materials and I have no doubt it will last for years.<br /><br />I love that the lid quietly closes, that I can keep all the trash and recycling out of sight and that the dog has yet to figure out how to get into the can.  I'm thrilled to no longer have to try and fit an ugly can under the sink!<br /><br />This size seems great for my household of two adults with a separate composter. A larger household might find themselves taking out the trash frequently.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the lid does pop up quite quickly and can wack against your wall - it's not leaving marks or anything but it is pretty exuberant about it.  Stepping lighter fixes that issue but I often don't even bother with the step - I just reach over and flip the lid up with my hand.  I will say the step seems MUCH better engineered than most. Every other step can I've had before this stopped working shortly after purchase. This one seems solidly built.<br /><br />The one thing I don't really like about this can is the liner situation.  I prefer to buy trash bags with some recycled plastic content and while I haven't done extensive research, it doesn't look like the custom liners SimpleHuman sells offer that. They are sturdy bags, and they DO fit into the can better than the other brands of kitchen bags I like to buy but I wish the SimpleHuman brand was a little 'greener'.  I'll probably just keep buying my preferred brand of bags and taking the extra time to tuck the excess edge of the bag down into the can to keep it stashed out of sight.  It's not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, a solid, attractive place to stow your trash and recycling in one secure place.",2013-01-20

The recycling hopper makes it easy to be a good human, and like another reviewer has said, you can always flip sides and use the big side for recycling and the small side for waste if your needs warrant it.<br /><br />The lid is amazing.  The slow-close is such a welcome addition after almost two years of the slamming lid our previous can had.  And the step is quite a piece of engineering itself; our can sits around a stub wall in our tiny kitchen, technically in the dining nook, we almost always step on the right-side of the step and the can takes the abuse in stride.  With our previous Big-Box no-name cheap stainless can, you could almost feel the stress you were putting on the pedal and linkage when you didn't step just right on it.<br /><br />Another perk over our previous can is that all the linkage and hardware is INSIDE the can.  The old one had a plastic bubble/blister/eyesore behind the lid that housed the hinge and lift assembly.  With the simplehuman its all inside, concealed, protected, and awesome.  The can sits perfectly flush with the wall (save for about 1-1.5&#34; of clearance to keep the lid from banging the wall when opened quickly) and looks great doing it.<br /><br />My wife balked at the price, but after we saw one in person at a local store, then she saw the Recycler model, she was sold as well.",2013-02-04

Now have one for each floor of 2 homes! Still have the original that i now use in the basement. The Swivel Sweeper has proven effective for picking up crumbs, hair, pet food nuggets, etc from hard surfaces or short pile carpet. Works best on hard surfaces. Periodic cleaning keeps sweeper working well. If you are lazy and never clean the brushes, you will not get the best results. Most folks completely forget there is a small filter to clean. Keep it clean - it is crucial to air flow to allow effective pick up. These do not replace a vacuum, but are great for quick pick ups and reduce the amount of vacuuming you will need to do. Do not use on long shag or other thick carpet if it gets caught or bogs way down When used properly, these are the greatest cleaning tool I have seen. Worth having even just for kitchen use - hard surfaces are the perfect surface for these. I do use them on our short carpets though for surface pickup. Oh - and this $23 price is amazing!!",2013-02-22

(The \\""buy one get one free, just pay additional s/h,\\"" ad.) I cancelled the order, went to my wonderful Amazon & ordered the new one for a total of $22 w/shipping!

Ok, so the new gray model is basically the same thing & good news is older red battery works in the new grey model.  It does seems to pick up better on difficult surfaces, (indoor/outdoor ribbed mat), but basically the same thing which is a good thing.  It weighs nothing, swivels everywhere, anywhere you want, (this model does not fold in the middle like the red older one), but other than that, the same. I personally love this since it's so easy, great for kitchen & bath floors, & a good quickie on carpeting.  I live alone so not a lot of traffic but I would not be w/out this handy item!

It was considerably more expensive, but I thought it would be more powerful, right?  Wrong.  I gave my little sweeper to my mother-in-law.  She loves it and boy do I miss it!  The stick vacuum doesn't do nearly as good a job picking up stuff as this little sweeper did.  It's heavier and can't get into places the sweeper did.  I'm getting another sweeper.  Like other reviewers said, keep in mind what this is and what it will and will not do.  It's not a deep cleaner; it does a great job on surface cleanups.

It’s a good looking model and definitely one of the iconic ships of the Empire, however, for the first time since I’ve been purchasing Star Wars Lego sets, I feel like it wasn’t quite worth the price I paid for it. Compare it to it’s rebel counterpart the X-wing fighter. The Lego X-wing was similarly priced but had more pieces and a much more involved building process. The Tie Fighter however has little more than 400 pieces which doesn‘t seem worth over $50. Also Steps 2 and 3 of the build are the same wing sections (or solar panels or whatever they are called in the SW universe), so you end up having to repeat the same step twice, which is necessary, but repetitious. Also, it might just be me, but I think the finished ship looks too narrow compared to ones seen in the movies.<br /><br />On the plus side, you get a good selection of mini-figs--four in all. There’s no important big name characters here, but I actually like to see more generic Imperial officers and soldiers represented to build the troops, rather than just sticking another Darth Vader in the set. The Tie Fighter pilot looks especially cool.<br /><br />I don’t want to knock the set too much. It really does look good next to the X-wing and it‘s actually pretty big when finished. Also building the cockpit had a bit of a puzzle like quality to it in that you didn’t know how it was going to shape up and fit together until all the pieces are in place, which is something I like about Lego. I just can’t help but feel it could be a bit more moderately priced.",2013-03-01

This picks up hair, dirt, and debris very well from smooth floors. This is not a vacuum and not really made for carpets. I do use it on the carpet in my kitchen that has very low knap and it works great.<br /><br />I was disappointed that this didn't have the one touch empty tray. In order to empty you have to push the tabs on top to get the tray to release and then empty it yourself. This little inconvenience is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />Also, in order to extend battery life, when not using the sweeper take the battery out or it will drain it very quickly.<br />Mostly I am very pleased, it's nicer to pull this out of the closet than lug out the big vacuum.",2013-03-20

My son and I have every Tie thus produced and I was stoked to see a much sleeker version of the TIE/LN or &#34;standard&#34; Tie come out to replace the older black with blue accent models. I'm hoping they redo the Tie Interceptor. The older sets are worth more to collectors, but since I have no intention of ever selling any of our massive collection, I am happy to see new and better models come out. Anyway, #9492 is a great model and we only like the Defender (#8087) better, out of all our Tie collection. It is also nice that the set comes with four minifigs, three of them fairly uncommon. I feel it was a good value and we bought a wing of three sets. Highly recommended.",2013-03-20

The set seems to fall apart easily when we attempt to pick it up, fly it, move it, etc, as the center cockpit isn't as secure as it should be. Plus, there were a couple of pieces missing from my set. I was surprised that it was so small, considering it was $50. But the minifigures are fantastic and made the cost of the set more palatable.<br /><br />As far as sets go, i was just okay with this one.

But when I came across a 50% off coupon I bought it at Michaels.  Sorry, Amazon...  BUT some of the punches aren't available in the stores, so I went back to Amazon and purchased a punch I really liked, so I'm good again, grin.<br /><br />For those of you who don't really know what you can do with these punches aside punching out doilies in all sizes, I invite you to visit my blog, [..] to see what I have done with this punch.  The possibilities really are, well, maybe not quite endless, but definitely several-fold.<br /><br />True, the instructions are a bit bare bones, but then again, the punch really is simple to use:<br />1.  open the punch by pulling it out of the plastic sleeve that covers the bottom.  See that cutting plate wedged inside?  Take it out, and put it in the machine's moving tray smooth side up.<br />2.  Decide upon what size circle you want to cut out.  Select that size at the rounded edge of the tool (see that lever that can move?  Say you want an 8\\"" circle, so you slide it on 8), then also move the cartridge (punch) up to the 8\\"" mark.  Do not go in between, it won't work.  You need to work with full inches only.<br />3.  Next, you find the center of a piece of paper larger than 8\\"" diameter (can be an 8.5\\"" x 11\\"", that's fine) and put that center underneath the cross hairs of the \\""knob\\"" on the left side of the punch, making sure that both of the \\""knob's\\"" magnets connect with their counterparts underneath for a secure hold.  Then you place the punch head on top of the paper (which extends over the bottom cutting plate, okay?) and hear the magnets connect as you place it down.  Punch, lift off the punch, and rotate the paper with the knob one notch in either direction.  Replace the punch and punch down, lift off, turn, place punch, punch down, and so on.  It sounds a little labor extensive, and it takes quite a few punches to get around the entire paper, but before long you get the hang of it and then it goes easy.  If you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.  It may not have aligned perfectly before.<br /><br />In time, as your punch feels a bit \\""sticky\\"", use wax or freezer paper and punch through that a few times.  That lubricates the punch and eliminates the \\""stickiness.  If you encounter areas that aren't punched cleanly, try punching through aluminum foil a few times to sharpen the punch again.<br /><br />If you still have trouble understanding how this punch works, please feel free to contact me via my blog and I will try to help you.  Note:  I am not affiliated with Martha Stewart in any way, not exactly a fan of her ever expanding \\""empire\\"", but I do acknowledge when an item is well made and thought out.you find it hard to punch, lift off, replace the punch, and try again.

I seem to remember booklets being a lot more vague and smaller back in the day. The pieces themselves were all there (In fact, I had a few extra small bits) and fit together exactly as intended.<br /><br />I think this probably took me somewhere around an hour and a half, perhaps two hours to build, and that was without any particular focus being put into it since I wanted to savor the build. The end result is a good size and displays very nicely.

I like the slow closing lid so after I throw something out, I don't have to worry about the trash anymore. When changing trash bags, you just have to lift the compartment up a bit and it stays there, about 3-4 inches higher than the rim of the stainless steal outside compartment. I don't have to take the inside out or try to hold it up to put in another trash bag. I don't know about you but I found this pretty amazing. The recycling bin is a bit narrow so if you just throw bottles in randomly, you'll run out of room quickly. However, it is tall enough to not be an issue often.<br /><br />My kitchen is rectangular and relatively narrow and small so I was worried about how bulky this would be. However, it fits perfectly along the narrow side wall and doesn't protrude annoyingly. You can also keep the lid open with the small switch on the side.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to manage<br />Convenient design during use and while dumping.<br />Great for narrow kitchens<br /><br />Cons:<br />Narrow recycling.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great convenient design that's good for apartments with a couple of people.

Now that it is built, she uses it occasionally but my son (who is 5) really likes to play with this set as well!<br /><br />We like playing out military/police/counterTerrorism scenarios with our Legos. With this set, I can finally teach him the importance of soft targets as a method of progression with a guerrilla based campaign fought by an under equipped and under funded army. We set up our artillery on the coffee table and put \\""Outpost Screwed\\"" (That's what we named it) out in the middle of the wood floor. If our artillery bombardment doesn't do the trick, we go in with our Armored Vehicles and supply .50 fire from a few hundred yards out. If all else fails (and if often does), we send in the foot soldiers to pull those cute little Lego Friends out by their boots and string 'em up on the Prince of Persia set we got 2 Christmases ago.<br /><br />The fun never ends in our house!

We LOVE this thing, and the price tag became a non-issue once it was in action. It's spendy, but with a 10 year warranty and completely solid and smart construction, it's entirely worth it.<br /><br />We replaced an old plastic trashcan with this, and it works perfectly for our needs. We love the fact that there's a separate compartment for the recycling, and the liners are great. We're seriously considering purchasing the SimpleHuman liners in bulk. It's incredibly easy to keep clean, it looks great, and it can bear the weight of our dopey 15lb cat without denting (nice bonus, but we discourage his jumping on it as much as we can).<br /><br />We haven't had any issues with the lid banging against the wall (another reviewer mentioned) unless we're particularly forceful in stepping down. It doesn't require a lot of pressure to open, so we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />The trashcan itself is huge (in a good way) - it doesn't look as big in the pictures which made me nervous until I grabbed the measuring tape. It won't hold as much trash as a conventional trashcan might, but we really don't need to hoard our trash that long either, so taking it out when it's full works and helps us avoid old trash stink in the kitchen.<br /><br />That being said, with the lid and the construction of the trash can, smelly stuff doesn't really escape unless the lid is open.

I've recently bought another punch pattern and for some reason, the larger of a circle you make the pattern comes out different and doesn't line up correctly.  Also, when you press down to make your punch if you don't line it up right you will dull the metal and it will not cut neatly with future punches.  I bought the other punch pattern at a craft store and I was able to exchange it due to the dulling of the metal (I've only had it for 2 days).  This product gives me a headache when I use it but at the same time, I love it.  I love the idea and I love the end product......just don't look too closely at;  you'll then see where the metal doesn't cut it smoothly and it looks like there are 'fuzzies' everywhere.  If you have used this, then you will know what I am talking about.  I gave it a nice 4 star only because I love the whole idea of it.

I always cut a piece of paper, so I can see how it cuts, so I can get the excess oil off of the tool, so I don't ruin good paper, and lastly so I make a sample of the pattern to place in an example book to reference later. I did put this tool together wrong, but found a happy &#34;problem&#34;. I'm guessing most have already discovered this, but if you put the cartridge holder (the plastic piece that goes on the base to determine the size of the circle) in backwards, you can cut your circle to use it as a border. Instead of cutting the circle out of your paper with the design on the outside, you can cut the circle out, so the design is on the inside of the paper.<br /><br />The tool seems very sturdy, I am not one to follow directions, and I just dive into putting items together. I put this together wrong, Instead of sliding the plastic size determining piece into the bottom of the base, I kind of shoved it in the teeth area. I was afraid, once I realized my mistake, that I might break the tool trying to fix my problem, but the plastic piece came out without anything breaking.

The pencil lead colors are very close to the barrel color – I was gladly surprised.<br /><br />The clutch (the thing that propels the lead out of the barrel) works typically: it does not hold the lead as the lead is propelled forward-you have to limit the lead’s travel by holding it just above the desk.

This circle edger can be fitted with an array of different patterns to make small to big circles, it's a very clever device.  Let me warn you, it is a little tricky to get the paper exactly centered, so I made a template for each size of paper and opened a tiny hole in the center of the template. Then I get a pencil and lightly mark the center on my paper. I place the magnet center on the little dot and play around with it for a few seconds until the magnet clicks into place in the unit, nicely centered. After I finish the circle I erase the little dot, and voila. I hope this helps you because it's hard to center it with the naked eye.

The description of the item says it includes instructions - but the only instructions are actually the pictures on the box, so keep the box for future reference!<br /><br />I ordered this item from Amazon, and it duly arrived, but in a very battered and squashed box.  The 5 crank rods were present, but the U-bracket was in pieces, one of the screws was missing and there was no sign of any instructions.  I assumed the instructions were missing in view of the other problems.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon Customer Service, who immediately arranged the delivery of another Gizmo.  The next unit - again in a rather battered box - had a properly assembled U-bracket, 5 crank rods, but no instructions.  It then dawned on me that the instructions mentioned on the list of contents, namely 1 U-bracket with built-in mount, 5 crank roads, Instructions - had to be the pictures printed on the box!<br /><br />Perhaps I should have been tipped off by the 'Econo' included in the title on the box, but not in the title on Amazon.<br /><br />After several attempts, and lots of wasted wire, I got the hang of it, but proper instructions and some tips would have been so helpful.

It is such a poor product it has cured me from being tempted to ever purchase anything but books online. I don't have the time or inclination to try to repackage it.

I read the instructions and the reviews and charged the batteries exactly 8 hours. I timed it because both the reviews and the instructions indicated that it matters. Then I tried it out.<br /><br />It is like a broom with an automatic dustpan. It sweeps stuff up and into the little tray, but has no suction whatsoever. If you expect it to act in any way like a vacuum, you will be disappointed. I didn't, as I had already seen my aunt's in action.<br /><br />Her model is a few years old, and mine is not the same. The two tabs you squeeze to empty the tray on hers very conveniently releases it from a hinged side, and after shaking out the stuff you just push it shut again and you're ready to go. What I just bought releases the whole tray which drops into the trash where you must fish it out, turn it over and empty it, and then aim it back and push to click it into place. The directions on how to do it say to put it flat on the floor, squeeze the release tabs, remove the sweeper, pick up the tray and empty, place it back on the floor, and then aim the sweeper and push down until you hear the click of it going back into place. The lack of ease and convenience in emptying is a big negative on my list of attributes.<br /><br />Next, I ran it around my kitchen. I have 3 cats so cat hair and dust bunnies are a big problem. The sweeper did a good job of getting it all up. A positive on my list.<br /><br />I decided to empty it before moving on. The cat hair mostly had wound around the various shafts and brushes. I used the seam ripper they provide, and got the stuff out but it was not quick and easy. This is a negative on my list. I believe it is because there is no suction to direct the hair so it wraps around.<br /><br />I went to the bathroom next and tackled the crumbs and grit from the litterbox, another issue with 3 cats. I use the clumping litter which has a finer grain than standard litter, so I amreporting on the finer grit, not the heavier standard grit litter. It picked it up beautifully. A positive on my list.<br /><br />However, before I got it run around the whole bathroom and the master walk in closet, it slowed almost to a stop. At first I thought it was the battery malfunctioning, but after I cleaned it out again and let it sit, it was back up to speed. Apparently the tray is small enough that I will have to stop partway thru to empty it. I know that three cats is a lot, but that seems just too small to me. A negative on my list. Perhaps if emptying it was easy and convenient it wouldn't seem like such a big deal. Fussing with that tray is irritating.<br /><br />Again, I had to use the seam ripper tool and work the cat hair out when I emptied it.<br /><br />All in all, the sweeper would be okay for someone to use on hard floors, who didn't have much animal hair to cope with, who doesn't mind fishing in the trash to get the tray back and onto the broom, and who doesn't have much dirt/hair/litter crumbs to sweep up.<br /><br />Addendum after about 6 months use: the battery won't hold a charge. i read all the info about the batteries, and how charging them too soon or for too long would shorten their life. i was obsessive about that, as i wanted to keep it functioning for a long time. i let the battery run out each time, and i set a timer and charged it for 7 hours each time. the instructions that came with said 6-8 hours, so i selected the middle and timed it, every single time. it is dead and won't hold even a small charge. what a ripoff. my considered opinion after using this unit is don't waste your money unless you don't mind replacing the battery every few months. given that batteries in other devices of all sorts manage to last more than 6 months or less, i think this may be a planned thing on the manufacturer's part to ensure a continuing revenue stream.",2014-07-27

She makes long coils with thinner wire first, then wraps those into larger coils that are pretty cool looking<br /><br />It is very simple to use.

I'll be introducing this PixScan feature to the entire class in the next couple of weeks, and I'm very excited about it.  I've really enjoyed this feature.  Thank you, Silhouette for making this available for us and on Amazon.com too!  The only reason I can figure out why people would not like this is if they aren't using it properly... and I'll have to admit, it was difficult to &#34;get&#34; it because, at first, there wasn't much in the way of tutorials or instruction.  I haven't looked lately, but I hope Silhouette is doing a better job at this because the technique is well worth having -- if you know how to calibrate your camera. I never did figure out how to calibrate my scanner.  It never did do right... and I'm a techno geek.  But, the saving grace was the ability to calibrate my camera(s).  With this, I've been able to photograph my 8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34; stamped cardstock on the PixScan Mat and cut the stamped images out precisely using the upgraded version of the Silhouette Design Studio software.  You have to be sure to upgrade your computer as well.  It is an easy process once these two things are done:  Calibrate camera and upgrade computer with Silhouette Design Software version 3.1.417.  I have not found the need to buy the Designer version since I have Sure Cuts A Lot and can manipulate SVG files with it and also do the Rhinestone features and more, but my students are enjoying the Designer edition of the software.  I would have bought it if I had needed it.  You don't need the upgraded Designer program in order to do this PixScan technique. I had figured out a way to stamp and cut without PixScan, but it was a drawn out process.  This PixScan made the task much easier.  I hope this helps!",2014-10-04

This gift has him excited.  When visitors come, I ask myself why he has taken them into our kitchen walk-in pantry.  Turns out it is a window-less room and perfect to demonstrate the light-up time on the wall or ceiling.    The noises are cool.  There is a button to press to hear the noises on demand.  R2 has a little repertoire that we all enjoy.  He beeps once softly on the hour, every hour, he tries to wake you at the alarm-set time.  There is an option to have the alarm off.  He looks great on a bed-side table.  Or anywhere.  Good for collectors, too.    So he is a clock, and not much use except for telling the time and waking you. And looking good.  It's not a toy, and having accepted this, my son loves it.  R2 is a great novelty for my son and he compares the digital time on R2 to an analogue clock also in his room.  The screen for reading the time is small, so you won't be checking out the time from across the room.  But on the bedside table, my son finds the numeral sizes are not an issue for him when he is in bed.    He's had it since early December 2014 and I'm waiting for the novelty to run out.

I've been wanting a Cameo for years, and after taking on the task of helping my best friend create her baby's first birthday party theme and decorations, I finally had a reason to get one!  I thought surely I'd be able to figure it out and use it for what I needed, but unfortunately, being so new to the machine and software, what I needed to do was so simple that it ended up being hard, lol, and I did not have much time to work with.  The tutorials I was able to find online were all WAY above what I needed to do right away (someday, though...) and I ended up spending 2 completely sleepless nights trying to figure out how to make the simplest things possible, and only realized at absolute crunch time that I'd gone about it all completely the wrong way from the beginning, since I was using a design package that my friend had chosen from a website and not a Cameo design.  The PixScan Mat was an Amazon suggestion at the time I bought the machine, and after watching the Cameo video, I thought it looked really cool and went ahead and added it to my order.  As I sat in the wee hours of this precious baby's birthday trying to figure out how I was going to undo all of my hours of incorrect work and get the things I needed to cut to actually go through the Cameo and cut (not something I could've just done with scissors!), it finally occurred to me, I had the PixScan Mat!  I whipped out my cell phone and snapped a pic of one of the million sheets of uncut card stock I had here and crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  It WORKED, and it was SO SIMPLE!!!  I had gotten so frustrated before that point, I actually went to my husband in TEARS of relief to show him my perfectly cut card stock that I was FINALLY able to accomplish with the PixScan Mat!  So, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!  You not only saved me, but you saved one sweet little baby girl's very first birthday party, too!!  I look forward to learning the machine better and being able to do all of the amazing things that I saw in the MANY tutorials that I watched, but, being such a newbie and needing to do something right away with the machine like that, I am SO GLAD that I added the PixScan Mat onto my order, and I can't wait to see what else I can do with it, too!  Seriously, how COOL is it to be able to just snap a pic with your cell phone and then create?  Also, since I ordered the Cameo kit, I actually got two of their regular mats, and I have to say, I MUCH prefer the texture and stickiness (it's sticky enough to hold the materials in place well, but they come off SO much easier and I didn't need any tools to peel everything off the mat like with the clear ones... also, there were no teeny bits of card stock residue left behind on it afterward like I'm STILL having to try to peel off of the clear ones) of the PixScan Mat over the original ones, and I ran it through my machine about a million times that night/morning and it's still in perfect condition, so it must be pretty darn durable, and I can definitely see myself using that one a lot more than the others whenever possible.  A GREAT concept, a GREAT product, and WHEW, am I glad I added THAT THING onto my order when I did, because I really don't know what I would've done without it in this situation!  Thanks SO much for selling such a wonderful product and getting it to me so quickly... I had left it in its wrapping thinking it would be something fun to play around with at some point in the future, but I was in SO much trouble and so desperate to get the items made that I had promised my friend for that party, and I looked over in my panic and exhaustion and saw it sitting there and thought, &#34;That is literally my ONLY hope to get any of this to work in time,&#34; and it was EXACTLY what I needed.  It was also so easy to use, my fried, tired brain had NO trouble figuring it out and I was able to get what I had been attempting to do for 2 days to happen perfectly in just a matter of minutes.  Not only that, but I ended up making even MORE items for the party than I originally intended because it was so fun and easy and quick to use once I got going!  Thank you SO much for bailing me out of a REALLY tough spot and also making the birthday party a beautiful success!  I can't wait to explore what all I can do with this mat now just for fun!  :)er of minutes.  Not only that, but I ended up making even MORE items for the party than I originally intended because it was so fun and easy and quick to use once I got going!

There are rings on both sides of this organizer, which is super convenient if you have a lot of scarves, but I imagine it would be hard to hang with other clothes in a closet as it would be so bulky and take up much space - I was going to hang it on my bedroom wall behind the door. The hanger hook is swivelly but the little melted nub on the bottom that keeps it in place on the cross bar seems a little weak. I wonder if I had filled the entire organizer with scarves if the hanger would have eventually broken? I had to return this as it was no use for my big scarves. FYI even though this qualifies as an Amazon Prime shipment, the returns are not free.",2015-03-06

No matter how I try, the cutting is just slightly askew.  And weirdly enough, the amount it's askew varies across the page.  I think that in reality, that's due to me taking a picture that's not precisely parallel to the mat; I'm always at a slight angle in one direction or another even when I think I'm not, which slightly skews the cuts.  I would recommend just using the offset feature and adding a little bumper around your cut items, or even pulling the cut *in* slightly, to eliminate wonky edges that weren't supposed to be there.  Despite its imperfections, I still think this is a way better option than printing things with registration marks; that always seemed to be too huge of a pain to actually do.  So this is a step up from that.  :)",2015-05-28

The mat seems to work best if you have a solid and clean image.  You put the image on the mat, then take a picture of it, load the picture into the Silhouette Studio, and the program brings your image up.  You then have to add trace lines so that the Silhouette can cut the image.  This was probably the hardest part for me.<br /><br />I was using the Silhouette to cut out props that I made for a photobooth. For the images that were solid and not very intricate (e.g., mustache), the cutting was great.  Not perfect, but good enough and required only minimal cleanup.  But for the images that had any amount of detail (e.g., guitar with strings), the tracing could not get the little lines without creating a mess of the whole project. At one point, I thought it was because the photos were not very clear, so I tried retaking the pictures multiple times and uploading them in. As clear as the image was on the screen, I could not get the tracing right in high or low.<br /><br />I think I will try the scanner function next time, instead of taking a picture of the image.  The only problem is my scanner is meant for an 8.5x11, whereas this mat is 12x12.  Not sure how that will work, but I am guessing it would produce a much better quality image than taking the picture with your camera or phone (both of which I tried).",2015-08-05
