US,18179253,R1VOL32UEWBQJZ,B000ETQ18W,494691696,Creamy Avocado Body Cleanser,Beauty,4.0,1.0,1.0,N,N,"Not perfect, but so entertaining that doesn t matter too much...","\\""Underworld: evolution\\"" is the sequel to \\""Underworld\\"", the supernatural thriller regarding an old feud between vampires and lycans, and as such is more of the same. By that, I mean uncomplicated fun for those who from time to time enjoy watching a fast paced film that has elements of fantasy in it, and that lacks food for thought but makes up for that with lots of entertainment value.<br /><br />Are you, like me, one of those people I mentioned above? If the answer is no, do not lose your time, this film is probably not the right one for you. If the answer is yes, I recommend you watch this movie, but only after having enjoyed the first one.<br /><br />Now I am going to talk a little about the plot of \\""Underworld: evolution\\"", so if you still have to watch the first movie in the series stop reading now, in order to avoid spoilers. The plot of this sequels picks up where the last one left off, and does an excellent job of allowing us to catch up with Selene (Kate Beckinsale), the beautiful vampire death-dealer, and Michael (Scott Speedman), the young lycan she has feelings for. Michael was turned by Selene into a hybrid of lycan and vampire in order to be saved from certain death, but that act of defiance and the fact that Selene killed an ancient vampire ruler to protect Michael, means that they are both on the run.<br /><br />But what exactly has Michael turned into, and will they be able to survive? And what will happen when Marcus (Tony Curran), another of the vampire elders, turns into a hybrid of a different kind, and finally achieves the power to free his dangerous brother, William (Brian Steele)? Things become even more complicated when we find out that Marcus was the father of all vampires, as William was the father of all lycans. On top of everything, Marcus and William s father, Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), decides to meddle and help Selene and Michael to stop his sons. The alternative is chaos, and a world full of crazed lycans running free and wreaking havoc.<br /><br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind. The result is that their story is more believable, and thus more engaging.<br /><br />All in all, I can say that I really enjoyed watching this film, and that I believe that is even better than the first one. Of course, \\""Underworld: evolution\\"" is not perfect, but it is so entertaining that does t matter too much. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: To Len Wiseman,please hurry up and make another sequel, I want to know what happens next to Selene and Michael :)<br /><br />PS2: To parents, this movie has quite a lot of violence and a nude scene, so it is not adequate for children.ree and wreaking havoc.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Len Wiseman (director) and Danny McBride (scriptwriter) did a great job filling some of the blanks left in the first movie, and continuing to tell us about an alternate universe where vampire and lycans fight for supremacy among mankind.

US,43542613,R2J5IBKWM5M55O,1415717214,817566555,Beverly Hills 90210 - The First Season [DVD],Beauty,5.0,0.0,0.0,N,Y,Great show. Enjoyable.,"I never watched the show when it aired, but the reruns caught my attention years ago. I enjoyed the episodes, and they were compelling. Recently, I decided to pick up the DVDs of Season One, and I've enjoyed the show once again. Again, the acting is impressive given what they had to work with. It's much better than anything that's on television the past decade. I wanted to make a commentary of some of the episodes. First thing I noticed is how many characters appear in one episode and then be never seen again. Having said that, notice how Brandon Walsh averages a woman per show. He is also a cheat, liar, racist, and drunk driver who could have killed somebody. He is easily pissed off and starts taking somebody's head out if slightly provoked. He acts like a saint with a conscience yet he is the biggest hypocrite I've seen on the show. At this point, I have a hard time debating who is worse: him or Brenda. She seems to have the flair of being so melodramatic, no matter the situation. She tries to take advantage of every opportunity to make the parents to feel worse by creating useless spats. I actually feel sorry for the parents, and I question their ever flowing leniency. On the other hand, I liked the rest of the characters, and they seem to be fine to me, even if they have innocuous glaring faults except for Steve Sanders. One episode \\""One on One,\\"" Brandon makes the basketball team yet we never see him playing basketball ever again in the rest of the season. Another episode where Brandon discovers how lowly paid the third world workers are, and he decides to write a report on the owner of the caf&eacute;. So what happened? Really...I am still amazed how the other characters suddenly get dropped out like flies after showing up for one episode. I was thinking also where were the friends of Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Steve because it's impossible that, given their popularity in school, they were friendless before the Walshes moved in Beverly Hills. Meanwhile, I liked the issues such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity. I know there is a lot of morality problem with the show while the characters delve themselves in the immoralities of life and still think they lead a life of morals. It's a tricky thing; however, the show is watchable regardless. That's why I enjoy it. For the DVD, it has been good, and letting you know, the pilot episodes are actually contained in the Season One package. That means you don't need to buy a separate DVD of the pilot show.such as AIDS, breast cancer, alcoholism, patricide, and homosexuality were brought up in 90210, and they speak for the show's integrity.

And my daughter loves it too! She has an Aurora Barbie and a little Sleeping Beauty book that we read, so it was a treat for her to actually see the DVD. I especially like the singing voice of Aurora, and the Three Good Fairie's personalities. The only complaint I have is that 16 years old is way too young to get married (these days, lol). Although Aurora and Phillip do not actually get married in this film, it is still talked about like they will be getting married very soon, like at age 16. Also, If you have a child who is scared of &#34;villians&#34; in stories, then the bad fairie Maleficent is pretty scary, lol, so you may want to wait until your child is older and can handle it better. Other than those two things, this is a very sweet young love story of a prince and princess who fall for each other, when they don't even know they are betrothed to one another already. And what the prince endures to save the princess from the evil fairie is a very romantic notion indeed.",2013-08-07
