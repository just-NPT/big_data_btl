It is bright, full-bodied and strong. [It is close to the English Breakfast blend.]<br /> Traditional Afternoon is bold, brisk and refreshing.<br /><br />Twinings Classics line blends Keemun and Ceylon teas for their English Afternoon Tea.<br /><br />Keemun is considered to have the best flavor and one of the best aromas.<br />[It is what the Queen drinks. That's a good thing.]<br /><br />Description:<br />[[ASIN:B000F4DKAI Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]]is a medium-based blend of Keemun and Ceylon black teas and has a medium flavor strength.<br />A brisk and lively black tea with the flavor of smokiness and earthiness combined with elements of sweetness.<br /><br />Both of these teas are excellent, BTW.",2009-12-05

This is definitely \\""Best enjoyed with milk.\\"" as the full-flavor strength balances well even with heaps of milk. This is especially useful if generous with adding milk to hot beverages, as I am! Even without milk, the tea is suprisingly smooth for being a strong tea which makes it unlike many other black teas I've tried.<br /><br />Although it doesn't appear to indicate Full Flavor Strength on the packaging pictured here, the blends are indentical to slightly different packaging by the same brand in Australia. Here they indicate it is Full Flavor Strength with five filled tea leaves on the front of the package.<br /><br />It appears based on the information on Amazon that this tea is a cross between the [[ASIN:B000F4H5GI Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Ceylon and Assam)and the [[ASIN:B000F4F952 Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Kenyan and Assam ) and yet this is an afternoon tea. However not to be confused with [[ASIN:B000F4DKAI Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, 1.41 oz. Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Keemun and Ceylon) which is entirely different and probably tastes different enough too.",2010-05-20

It contains a plethora of simple ice cream and sorbet recipes. There's even a couple of baking and sauce recipes. Many people will take issue with the fact that the base recipe does not direct you to cook your egg mixture, however, I simply heat my eggs, milk, and sugar until almost boiling. Then I add the heavy cream, etc, and cool the mixture. Simple. You will find every flavor you could want and some you might not want. I've tried half a dozen recipes and have loved each one. This is a great reference book. Enjoy!",2013-10-11

I generally drink it for breakfast (and I prefer Irish breakfast tea in the afternoon, go figure), very strong and with no milk added.  I find it is a bit lighter than other teas I drink (primarily Assam and the aforementioned Irish breakfast tea), but by no means weak or flavorless.  It does not get bitter or develop off flavors when brewed up strong, a quality much appreciated since I don't add anything to my tea.  It is very smooth and pleasant.  (I've just now taken a sip of this  tea which has been sitting in my teapot, with the tea bags, for over two hours and it is mellow, almost silky, and yes, still hot.  God bless tea cozies.)<br /><br />If you enjoy Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, English Breakfast Tea, or any of the teas which make up this blend (Kenyan, Ceylon, and Assam I believe, although my package is no more specific than &#34;Africa, Sri Lanka, and India&#34;) you should consider giving this a try.",2013-12-29
